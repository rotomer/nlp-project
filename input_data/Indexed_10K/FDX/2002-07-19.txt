Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition GENERAL The following managements discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies, of FedEx Corporation (also referred to as FedEx). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements, which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results. FedEx is one of the largest transportation companies in the world. Our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units. These business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments: FedEx Express, the worlds largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground, North Americas second largest provider of small package ground delivery service; and FedEx Freight, the largest U.S. provider of regional less than truckload freight services. The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks, as measured by our average daily volume; the mix of services purchased by our customers; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by average price per shipment (yield); our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits, fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels. Except as otherwise indicated, references to years mean our fiscal year ended May 31, 2002 or ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following table compares revenues, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2002 2001(1) 2000 2002/ 2001  2001/ 2000  Revenues $ 20,607 $ 19,629 $ 18,257 + 5 +8 Operating income 1,321 1,071 1,221 +23 12 Net income 710 584 688 +22 15 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.34 $ 1.99 $ 2.32 +18 14 (1) Results for 2001 include noncash charges of $102 million for impairment of certain assets related to aircraft programs at FedEx Express and a $22 million reorganization charge at FedEx Supply Chain Services. These charges were $78 million after tax or $.27 per diluted share. Our 2002 results reflect outstanding revenue and earnings growth at FedEx Ground. Operating income at this segment increased $162 million or 93%, reflecting volume growth in FedEx Grounds core business and reduced losses in its home delivery service. The performance of FedEx Ground, and the addition of FedEx Freight East (formerly known as American Freightways) in the third quarter of 2001, contributed to improved net income for 2002, but were mitigated by continued softness in package volumes at FedEx Express. Volume levels in our FedEx Express domestic and international package services declined in 2002 as a result of continued weakness in the U.S. and global economies (particularly 37 Table of Contents in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors), which has decreased demand for our higher priced express services. Revenue from our transportation agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), which commenced in the first quarter of 2002, as well as effective cost management, helped soften the impact of reduced package volumes at FedEx Express. Largely due to the contributions of FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and the fact that 2001 included approximately $124 million in noncash charges (discussed below), operating income increased significantly in 2002. Discretionary spending (such as professional fees and travel related expenses) was reduced approximately $108 million during 2002. Pension costs were approximately $90 million higher in 2002, due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets. Variable compensation was slightly higher in 2002. During 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel, respectively. Lower fuel prices during 2002 had a positive impact on operating expenses; however, declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income. Conversely, fuel surcharge revenue in 2001 more than offset the impact of higher fuel costs. During 2001, increased fuel prices negatively impacted year over year expenses by approximately $160 million, net of the effects of jet fuel hedging contracts. We received approximately $92 million in 2001 under jet fuel hedging contracts, which we effectively closed during the fourth quarter of 2001 by entering into offsetting contracts. The maturity of these contracts increased 2002 fuel costs by approximately $15 million. Net income for 2002 reflects the cumulative effect of an accounting change recorded in the first quarter. This change resulted from adoption of new rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets (see Note 2 and Note 4 to the accompanying audited financial statements). Adoption of these new rules resulted in the first quarter recognition of a $25 million ($15 million net of tax or $.05 per share) impairment charge to our recorded goodwill. Results for 2002 also reflect the cessation of $36 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses, as required under the new accounting rules. Goodwill amortization expense was $26 million for 2001 and $17 million for 2000. Our results for 2001 reflected strong performance during the first half, which was more than offset by the effects of weakened economic conditions in the second half of the year. As a result of lower domestic volumes at FedEx Express in the second half of 2001 and lowered capacity growth forecasts, management committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our MD10 program (which upgrades and modifies our older DC10 aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer MD11 aircraft). By curtailing the MD10 program, we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through 2008. During 2001, we also took actions to reorganize our FedEx Supply Chain Services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable, non strategic logistics business and reduce its overhead. In addition, due to the bankruptcy of Ayres Corporation, we wrote off deposits and related items in 2001 in connection with the Ayres ALM200 aircraft program. Following is a summary of these charges (in millions): Impairment of certain assets related to the MD10 aircraft program $ 93 Strategic realignment of logistics subsidiary 22 Ayres program write off 9 Total $124 Results for 2002 were favorably affected by approximately $12 million, related to the charges above, based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates. No material amounts remained on the balance sheet for these items at the end of 2002. 38 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2001 and 2000, revenues increased slightly in 2001, reflecting revenue growth of FedEx International Priority&reg; (IP) packages. During 2001, volume growth was higher at FedEx Ground as this subsidiary continued to grow its core business and expand its new home delivery service offering. The effects of the acquisition of FedEx Freight East added approximately $630 million to 2001 revenues. The acquisition resulted in recognition of approximately $600 million in goodwill and was slightly accretive to 2001 earnings per diluted share. For further information regarding this acquisition, see Liquidity and Note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements. Our 2001 operating results reflected the continuing implementation of the rebranding and reorganization initiatives begun in the last half of 2000 to leverage the FedEx name and centralize certain sales, marketing and technology functions of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground into FedEx Services (see Reportable Segments below). These rebranding costs did not have a significant impact on 2002 results and were approximately $26 million for 2001 and $21 million for 2000. Our 2001 results included a significant reduction in operating costs related to reduced provisions under our variable compensation plans. Pension costs were approximately $70 million lower in 2001, due principally to higher discount rates. Other Income and Expense and Income Taxes Interest expense was slightly lower in 2002, as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year (see Financial Condition below). Financing for the acquisition of FedEx Freight East, which was completed in the third quarter of 2001, was the principal reason net interest expense was 36% higher in 2001. In 2002, other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately $17 million from the retirement of debt assumed in the FedEx Freight East acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations. Other nonoperating expenses in 2000 included gains of approximately $12 million from an insurance settlement for a destroyed MD11 aircraft and approximately $11 million from the sale of securities. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2002, 37.0% in 2001 and 39.5% in 2000. The 37.5% effective tax rate in 2002 was higher than the 2001 effective rate primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in 2001. The 2002 rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization (as discussed above) and by several other factors, none of which were individually significant. The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory U.S. federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes. For 2003, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 38.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income. At May 31, 2002, we had a net deferred tax liability of $130 million, consisting of $1 billion of deferred tax assets and $1.1 billion of deferred tax liabilities. The reversal of deferred tax assets in future periods is expected to be offset by similar amounts of deferred tax liabilities. Terrorist Attacks of September 11 Fiscal 2002 second quarter operations were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. All domestic FedEx Express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on September 11 and 12, and flight operations resumed on the evening of September 13, 2001. During the period our aircraft were grounded, both domestic and international shipments were impacted, with domestic average daily express volumes declining almost 50% from prior year levels. We executed contingency plans and transported all domestic shipments during this period through ground based 39 Table of Contents trucking operations. We resumed air operations within hours of receiving clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration. Business levels at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight were not materially affected. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, the U.S. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the Act), an emergency economic assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses experienced by the nations air carriers. The Act provides for $5 billion to be used for financial assistance to airlines to offset losses caused by service disruptions and declines in business activity related to these attacks for the period September 11, 2001 through December 31, 2001. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 01 10, Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, in September 2001 to establish accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Under EITF 01 10, federal assistance provided to air carriers in the form of direct compensation from the U.S. government under the Act should be recognized when the related losses are incurred and compensation under the Act is probable. We recognized $119 million of compensation under the Act in 2002. We have classified all amounts recognized under this program (of which $101 million was received as of May 31, 2002) as a reduction of operating expenses under the caption Airline stabilization compensation. While we believe we have complied with all aspects of the Act and that it is probable we will ultimately receive the remaining $18 million receivable, compensation previously recognized is subject to audit and interpretation by the Department of Transportation (DOT). We have received requests from the DOT for additional information in support of our claims under the Act and have responded fully to these requests. We cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome of such interpretations, but it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the amount of compensation recognized by us under the Act could occur. Although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming, as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may have on our results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, we are not certain how the events of September 11, or any subsequent terrorist activities, will ultimately impact the U.S. and global economies in general, and the air transportation industry in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs or on the demand for our services. Outlook On May 31, 2002, we announced our first ever payment of a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $.05 per share. We expect to continue these quarterly cash dividend payments, although each subsequent dividend is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors. The economic downturn that began in calendar 2001 provided opportunities for management teams within the FedEx family to examine growth strategies and take steps to right size our transportation networks, improve service and provide choices to fit our customers transportation needs. We believe we are well positioned for long term growth when the economy, particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, recovers and experiences sustained growth. For 2003, we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of an economic stabilization during the first half of 2003 and a recovery during the remainder of the year are realized. 40 Table of Contents Our diverse portfolio of services is the key factor to our long term growth. The expansion of FedEx Grounds home delivery network and continued development and cross selling of the diverse FedEx portfolio of services, particularly to small and medium sized businesses, is central to our strategy. Our Web site, fedex.com, is heavily utilized and has helped us reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Management believes that our substantially fixed cost infrastructure will allow us to realize incremental profits when the economy recovers. Pension costs are expected to continue to increase over the near term. Our pension cost for 2003 will increase by approximately $90 million due to lower interest rates in 2002 and the effects of decreased returns on pension plan assets. For 2003, we will lower our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from 10.9% to 10.1%. While employee retirement costs continue to rise, our retirement programs are well funded, with assets sufficient to meet our current obligations. Maintenance costs are expected to be higher in 2003 due to scheduled maintenance activities. Higher group health and other insurance costs are also anticipated. In spite of the impact of these increased expenses, we expect our operating margin to slightly improve as a result of continued focus on cost reductions (including hiring restrictions and reduced discretionary spending), productivity improvements and a reduction in the FedEx Home Delivery loss. Actual results for 2003 will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing, speed and magnitude of the economic recovery, our ability to match capacity with volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives. In addition, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before the surcharges are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount. See Forward Looking Statements for a more complete description of potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future performance. Seasonality of Business Our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature. Historically, the U.S. package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia to U.S. market, peaks in October and November due to U.S. holiday sales. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday seasons, have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods. The transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies. Seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage, revenues and earnings. Normally, the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground and FedEx Custom Critical, while the latter part of December, January, June and July of each year are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of December, January and February of each year are the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations in June 2001 and SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets in October 2001. These statements will be effective for FedEx beginning in 2003. We do not expect the application of these new accounting standards to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 41 Table of Contents REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, each of which operates in a single line of business. Included within Other are the operations of FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx Services. Other also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations. Management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income. The formation of FedEx Services at the beginning of 2001 represented the implementation of a business strategy that combined the sales, marketing and information technology functions of our FedEx Express and FedEx Ground reportable segments to form a shared services company that supports the package businesses of both of these segments. FedEx Services provides our customers with a single point of contact for all express and ground services. Prior to the formation of FedEx Services, each business had its own self contained sales, marketing and information technology functions. The costs for these activities are now allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided. These allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions. The line item Intercompany charges on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from FedEx Services to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, and certain other costs such as corporate management fees.

See Reportable Segments above. (2) The U.S. overnight box category includes packages exceeding 8 ounces in weight. (3) The U.S. overnight envelope category includes envelopes weighing 8 ounces or less. (4) 2001 includes a $93 million charge for impairment of the MD10 aircraft program and a $9 million charge for the Ayres program write off. FedEx Express Revenues Volumes at FedEx Express continue to be below levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown, which began in 2001. Volumes were also significantly impacted by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. All domestic FedEx Express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on September 11 and 12, and flight operations resumed on the evening of September 13, 2001. Both domestic and international shipments were impacted by this event. During 2002, total package revenue decreased 6%, principally due to decreases in volumes. In the United States, package revenue declined 7% (on 6% lower average daily domestic express package volume, principally in U.S. overnight box and envelope volumes). While IP volume decreased slightly in 2002, principally due to a decline in U.S. outbound shipments, IP volumes were positively impacted by the European and Asian economies, although volumes in these markets did not grow as much as in 2001. For 2002, FedEx Express experienced IP average daily volume growth rates of 15% and 5% in the European and Asian markets, respectively. Package yields are slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. In the second quarter of 2002, we implemented a new index for determining our fuel surcharge. Using this new index, the fuel surcharge ranged between 0% and 3% from November 2001 through May 2002. The fuel surcharge during all of 2001 was 4%. In 2001, total package revenue increased 5%, principally due to increases in yields and IP volumes. The increase in yields in 2001 was a result of yield management, which included limiting growth of less profitable business and recovering the higher cost of fuel through a fuel surcharge. Domestic rate 43 Table of Contents increases in February 2001 also contributed to the higher yield during 2001. While the IP volume growth was 8% for 2001, this rate was impacted by a year over year increase in U.S. outbound shipments, offset by weakness in the Asian economy in the last half of the year. For 2001, FedEx Express experienced IP average daily volume growth rates of 24% in the European market and 12% in the Asian market. Total freight revenue for 2002 increased significantly due to improved domestic freight volume and yield, reflecting the impact of the USPS transportation agreement, which began in August 2001. On January 10, 2001, FedEx Express and the USPS entered into two service contracts: one for domestic air transportation and the other for placement of FedEx Drop Boxes at U.S. Post Offices. On December 13, 2001, we signed an addendum to our transportation agreement with the USPS, effective for a 10 month period beginning January 1, 2002, which allows us to carry incremental pounds of mail at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement. In 2001, total freight revenue increased slightly over 2000 due to significantly improved yields in U.S. freight, partially offset by declines in domestic freight volume and international freight volume and yield. Other revenue (which includes Canadian domestic revenue, charter services, logistics services, sales of hushkits and other) increased 10% in 2002. In 2001 and 2000, other revenue decreased, mostly due to declines in the sale of hushkits. Hushkits sales were insignificant in 2002. FedEx Express Operating Income In 2002, operating income at FedEx Express decreased 4%. Excluding $102 million of asset impairment charges taken in 2001, operating income was down 15% in 2002. Revenue declines in 2002 on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions. During 2002, contractual reimbursements received from the USPS substantially offset network expansion costs incurred (principally in increased salaries). USPS reimbursements during 2002 are reflected as a credit to other operating expenses. This reimbursement, however, had no effect on operating income, as it represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred. In 2002, FedEx Express recognized $27 million of operating income from the resolution of certain state tax matters, which is also reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses. Operating income for 2002 also reflects the adoption of new rules from the FASB for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets (as discussed in Consolidated Results above). For FedEx Express, adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of $12 million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002 (this amortization amount is comparable to 2001 and 2000). Rentals and landing fees were higher in 2002 primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental domestic freight volume. While fuel usage was higher in 2002 due to incremental freight pounds transported under the USPS agreement, fuel costs were down, as the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel decreased 12% in 2002. During 2001, increased fuel expense reflected a 17% increase in average jet fuel price per gallon, which contributed to a negative impact of approximately $150 million, including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts entered into to mitigate some of the increased jet fuel costs. For 2002, salaries, wages and benefits were higher in spite of reductions in hours and full time equivalents, which were not sufficient to offset base salary increases and higher pension and medical costs. This is partially because a significant portion of incremental cost increases related to the USPS contract is reflected in salaries and wages. Pension costs at FedEx Express were approximately $60 million higher in 2002. Profit sharing and incentive compensation provisions were down significantly for 2002. 44 Table of Contents In 2001, operating income decreased 6%, reflecting charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter (see Consolidated Results above). Excluding these charges, operating income increased 5% in 2001, despite a slowdown in revenue growth that year, as reduced variable compensation and pension costs, coupled with intensified cost controls over discretionary spending, had a positive impact. Declining contributions from sales of hushkits negatively impacted operating profit by $40 million in 2001. FedEx Express Outlook While we believe economic growth during the first half of 2003 will be slow, particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, we expect revenue to increase during 2003, in both the domestic and international markets. Revenue growth is expected to exceed expense growth due to increases in both domestic and international package volumes and yield. Operating margin for this segment is expected to increase in 2003 despite increasing pension and health care costs, insurance expenses, maintenance costs and costs associated with annual wage increases. Our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued cost control efforts, with a particular focus on significant improvements in productivity and transportation network efficiency. We will also benefit in 2003 from a full year of operations under our transportation contract with the USPS. Although fuel price increases are anticipated during 2003, they are not expected to significantly impact earnings as our fuel surcharge is closely linked to prevailing market prices for jet fuel. Our fuel surcharge has a lag that exists before it is adjusted for changes in jet fuel prices. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of jet fuel suddenly change by a significant amount. FEDEX GROUND The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income (dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2002 2001 2000(1) 2002/ 2001  2001/ 2000  Revenues $ 2,711 $ 2,237 $ 2,033 +21 +10 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 532 450 +18 Purchased transportation 1,032 881 +17 Rentals 71 67 +6 Depreciation and amortization 132 111 +19 Fuel 4 8 50 Maintenance and repairs 73 63 +16 Intercompany charges 238 215 +11 Other 292 267 +9 Total operating expenses 2,374 2,062 1,807 +15 +14 Operating income $ 337 $ 175 $ 226 +93 23 Average daily packages 1,755 1,520 1,442 +15 +5 Revenue per package (yield) $ 6.11 $ 5.79 $ 5.55 +6 +4 (1) Operating expense detail for 2000 has been omitted, as this data is not comparable. See Reportable Segments above. 45 Table of Contents FedEx Ground Revenues Core business growth and the increasing popularity of our new home delivery service helped FedEx Ground realize double digit revenue growth in both 2002 and 2001, as volumes and yields increased. Sales and marketing activities have been effective in attracting new small and medium sized customers, which generate higher yielding package revenues. For 2002 and 2001, the increase in average daily packages represents positive volume growth experienced in all principal markets served by FedEx Ground, including FedEx Home Delivery, which added facilities to reach almost 90% coverage of the U.S. population. In 2002 and 2001, year over year yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases, ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages. In the third quarter of 2002, we implemented a new dynamic fuel surcharge, which is indexed to the current price of diesel fuel. Using this new index, the fuel surcharge ranged between .50% and ..75% from February through May 2002. A 1.25% fuel surcharge was in effect for most of 2001. FedEx Ground Operating Income FedEx Grounds operating income significantly increased in 2002 primarily due to package volume growth, higher yields, productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management. FedEx Home Delivery had a loss of $32 million in 2002, which is a significant improvement from the loss in 2001. Facility openings and expansions, as well as increased investments in information systems, resulted in increased depreciation, rental and other property related expenses during 2002. Salaries, wages and benefits also were higher in 2002 due to additional full time equivalents and higher pension and medical costs. Costs for our variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during 2002, reflecting FedEx Grounds outstanding financial performance. During 2001, operating income decreased 23%, primarily due to a FedEx Home Delivery operating loss of $52 million and rebranding and reorganization expenses of $15 million. The rebranding and reorganization expenses consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans, trailers and signage. Such costs were expensed as incurred. Excluding the negative impact of these expenses, operating income decreased 2% from 2000. Facility openings and expansions, as well as increased investments in information systems, resulted in higher depreciation, rental and other property related expenses during 2001. FedEx Home Delivery, launched in March 2000, negatively affected 2000 operating income by approximately $19 million. FedEx Ground Outlook For 2003, volumes and yield are expected to grow in both the core business and FedEx Home Delivery. FedEx Ground will continue expansion of the FedEx Home Delivery network to serve nearly 100% of the U.S. population by mid September 2002. Plans for 2003 will be focused on improvements in on time delivery, productivity and safety. Total operating profit for FedEx Ground is expected to improve over 2002, although we expect operating margin to decrease because FedEx Ground will absorb a larger portion of allocated sales, marketing, customer support and information technology costs during 2003. During 2003, we expect the operating loss from FedEx Home Delivery to improve, with this service becoming profitable sometime in 2004. 46 Table of Contents FEDEX FREIGHT The following table shows revenues, operating expenses and operating income (in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31: 2002 2001(1) Revenues $ 1,960 $ 835 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 1,170 489 Purchased transportation 57 23 Rentals 64 27 Depreciation and amortization 86 44 Fuel 72 41 Maintenance and repairs 90 39 Intercompany charges 8 1 Other 245 116 Total operating expenses 1,792 780 Operating income $ 168 $ 55 Shipments per day(2) 56,000 56,012 Weight per shipment (lbs)(2) 1,114 1,132 Revenue per hundredweight(2) $ 12.41 $ 11.83 (1) Results for 2001 include the financial results of FedEx Freight West from December 1, 2000 and of FedEx Freight East from January 1, 2001 (the date of acquisition for financial reporting purposes). Therefore, 2001 results are not comparable to 2002. (2) Statistics for 2001 are based on portion of the year including both FedEx Freight West and FedEx Freight East (January through May). Although revenues were higher in 2002 due to the inclusion of a full year of operations, revenues were impacted by lower than expected volumes, due to the economic slowdown, and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge. The FedEx Freight fuel surcharge is tied to the Retail on Highway Diesel Fuel Price, as published by the U.S. Department of Energy, and changes weekly based on changes in the index. In 2002, average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year, weight per shipment was down 2% and revenue per hundredweight was up 5%. During this difficult economic environment, FedEx Freight improved yields and managed costs. Operating margins were 8.6% in 2002, reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization and stable pricing, partially offset by the impact of $6 million of rebranding expenses, primarily for tractors and trailers. Our focus on providing superior service to attract and maintain customers solidified our leadership position in the regional less than truckload (LTL) market. Operating income for FedEx Freight in 2002 reflects the adoption of new rules from the FASB for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets (as discussed in Consolidated Results above). For FedEx Freight, adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of $15 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002. For 2001, goodwill amortization recorded by FedEx Freight was $6 million, reflecting the acquisition of FedEx Freight East in January 2001. FedEx Freight Outlook We announced in February 2002 that FedEx Freight East (formerly known as American Freightways) and FedEx Freight West (formerly known as Viking Freight) are being rebranded under the name FedEx Freight. We believe this will allow us to take advantage of the FedEx brand and create additional synergies, which will give us a competitive advantage and continue to improve our market share in the LTL segment. The rebranding expenses will consist primarily of incremental external costs 47 Table of Contents for rebranding tractors and trailers, which will be expensed as incurred. The cost of the rebranding is expected to increase FedEx Freights operating expenses by approximately $15 million in 2003. We expect a total of approximately $40 to $45 million to be spent on rebranding at FedEx Freight through 2005. The complementary geographic regions served by FedEx Freight East and FedEx Freight West are expected to have a positive impact on results of operations for this segment. Both companies will continue to focus on day definite regional LTL service, but will also collaborate to serve customers who have multiregional LTL needs. In June 2002 we announced a series of new premium service offerings, including optional money back guaranteed transit times in the West and expanded next day coverage up to 900 miles in selected lanes in the East. These new service offerings will provide our customers with additional shipping options. On June 27, 2002, we announced a general rate increase of 5.9% to be effective July 22, 2002. Yield management, enhanced productivity and cost control measures continue to be major focus areas for FedEx Freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment. OTHER OPERATIONS Other operations include FedEx Custom Critical, a critical shipment carrier; FedEx Trade Networks, whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company; FedEx Services, a provider of supply chain management services and sales, marketing and IT support for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground; and certain unallocated corporate items. Also included in this category are the operating results of FedEx Freight West prior to December 1, 2000. Revenues from other operations were $609 million (down 40%) in 2002 compared to $1.0 billion in 2001 and $1.2 billion in 2000. During 2002, a significant portion of the decrease in revenues reflects the fact that current year results for this category no longer include FedEx Freight Wests revenues (see FedEx Freight above). In both 2002 and 2001, revenues at FedEx Custom Critical were down 24%, largely due to the economic downturn. The demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary (critical shipments) is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators, principally in the automotive industry, where volumes have been depressed since calendar 2001. Operating income from other operations was $5 million in 2002 compared to an operating loss of $6 million in 2001 and operating income of $95 million in 2000. The improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflects reduced operating costs at FedEx Supply Chain Services. The decrease in operating income in 2001 over 2000 reflects the effect of the economic slowdown on FedEx Custom Critical during 2001 (which had strong earnings growth in 2000) and lower performance of FedEx Supply Chain Services. Operating income in 2000 had strong earnings from FedEx Freight West and also included a $10 million favorable adjustment related to estimated future lease costs from a 1997 restructuring at FedEx Freight West. On March 1, 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc., which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for FedEx Express in three U.S. locations at a cost of $36.5 million. 48 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies, and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent auditors. REVENUE RECOGNITION We believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing a companys overall financial performance, and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace. Our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments. Our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational, billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue, bill customers and collect amounts due to us. We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or, for our logistics and trade services businesses, upon the completion of services. In addition, transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period: (1) recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or (2) recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred. We use the second method; we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred. We believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred. There are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above: (1) estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered; (2) estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit; and (3) estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts. Unbilled Revenue. Primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers, there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice. At the end of a month, unprocessed invoices may be as much as one third of the total months revenue. This revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes. Most of these accruals are represented by invoices that are essentially complete, with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued. The remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment. These estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced. Because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes, the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced. 49 Table of Contents Shipments in Process. The majority of our shipments have short cycle times and therefore less than 5% of a total months revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period. At month end, we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up, the scheduled day of delivery, the day of the week on which the month ends (which affects the percentage of completion) and current trends in our average price for the respective services. We believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period. Future Adjustments to Revenue and Accounts Receivable. Like many companies, we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable. Historically, our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective. We also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money back service guarantees and billing corrections. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts, adjustments processed, and current collections trends. Allowances for these future adjustments aggregated $147 million at May 31, 2002 and $137 million at May 31, 2001. We consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions, pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances. PENSION COST We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees. The accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates, which include: employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages; discount rates; expected long term investment returns on plan assets; and future salary increases. We consider the most critical of these to be our discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets (and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied) and the rate of future increases in salaries. For FedEx, many of these assumptions are highly sensitive in the determination of a years pension cost because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans. For example, fewer than 5% of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits. Therefore, the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future. This long time period increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our pension cost. Total pension costs increased approximately $90 million in 2002 and are expected to increase an additional $90 million in 2003. Discount Rate. This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value (defined as the projected benefit obligation). The discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date (February 28) and affects the succeeding years pension cost. A decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense. This assumption is highly sensitive, as a one basis point change in the discount rate affects our pension expense by approximately $1 million. For example, the 60 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 7.1% for 2002 from 7.7% for 2001 will negatively affect our 2003 pension cost by approximately $60 million. 50 Table of Contents We determine the discount rate (which is meant to be the current rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments. This methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity. However, the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds. Plan Assets. The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. With over $5.5 billion of plan assets, a one basis point change in this assumption directly affects pension cost by approximately $600,000 (a decrease in the assumed expected long term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense). Our 2002 expected long term rate of return of 10.9% reflects our active investment management program, which has consistently outperformed the related market indices over the past ten years. Also, because of our relatively young workforce, we are able to maintain more of our pension assets invested in higher returning, longer term equity investments. While plan investments are subject to short term volatility, they are well diversified and the asset portfolios are closely managed. We review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly. Based on recent trends in asset performance and generally lower risk premiums in equity markets, we lowered the expected long term rate of return for 2003 to 10.1%. This 80 basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return will negatively affect our 2003 pension cost by approximately $48 million. Further adjustments to this estimate may be necessary in the future. Investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied, which will further increase our pension cost in 2003. Despite poor asset performance over the past two years that has generated investment losses, our pension plan is and will continue to be appropriately funded to meet the payment of benefits as such obligations become due. Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated value method, which helps mitigate short term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases). The application of this accounting policy reduced 2002 pension cost by approximately $16 million. Salary Increases. The assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost. We correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate (since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability (incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages). A one basis point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately $700,000 (a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost). Thus, the decrease in the assumption to 3.3% at the end of 2002 from 4.0% will favorably impact 2003 pension cost by approximately $50 million. SELF INSURANCE ACCRUALS We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accident and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee health care programs. At May 31, 2002 we had total self insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet of approximately $839 million ($776 million at May 31, 2001). The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily 51 Table of Contents through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in health costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. LONG LIVED ASSETS Property and Equipment. Our key businesses are capital intensive. Over 60% of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards. Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred. The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (over 20 years for certain of our aircraft equipment), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated lives or salvage values are necessary. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically less than $10 million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future based on technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory requirements, and other factors beyond our control. Because we must plan for future volume levels for multiple years in order to make commitments for aircraft based on those projections, we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. Because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets, and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of capacity needs, and those decisions may result in an impairment. For example, in 2001 we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at FedEx Express related to our MD10 conversion program. The decision allowed us to avoid approximately $1.1 billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of $93 million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated disposal value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal. During 2002 we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired MD10 program assets, which resulted in a favorable adjustment of $9 million. Leases. We utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft. Over the years, we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in Contractual Cash Obligations below and Note 7 to the 52 Table of Contents accompanying audited financial statements, at May 31, 2002 we had approximately $15 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for operating leases. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. We believe we have well defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation. Goodwill. We have in excess of $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses. New accounting standards adopted in 2002 require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization. As previously indicated, the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of $25 million in 2002 at one of our smaller businesses. The annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values. Changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates. However, once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY We reached a significant milestone in 2002, as we declared our first ever cash dividend. On May 31, 2002, we announced that shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2002 will be paid a $.05 cash dividend per share of common stock. We expect to continue these quarterly dividend payments, although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $331 million at May 31, 2002, compared to $121 million at May 31, 2001. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,228 $ 2,044 $ 1,625 Cash used in investing activities: Capital investments and other (1,577 ) (1,636 ) (1,451 ) Business acquisitions (35 ) (477 ) (257 ) Free cash flow 616 (69 ) (83 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (406 ) 122 (174 ) Increase (decrease) in cash $ 210 $ 53 $ (257 ) 53 Table of Contents The following cash based measure is presented as an additional means of evaluating our financial condition because we incur significant noncash charges, including depreciation and amortization, related to the material capital assets utilized in our business. This measure should not be considered as a superior alternative to net income, operating income, cash from operations, or any other operating or liquidity performance measure as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following table compares EBITDA, as adjusted (earnings before goodwill accounting changes, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the years ended May 31 (in billions): 2002 2001 2000 EBITDA, as adjusted $ 2.7 $ 2.3 $ 2.4 The increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2002 reflects increases in EBITDA, as adjusted (which includes FedEx Freight for an entire year) and aggressive working capital management. In 2001, the addition of FedEx Freight East improved cash provided by operating activities for that year. Cash Used for Capital Investments. Capital expenditures during 2002 were lower, primarily at FedEx Express where capital expenditures were 14% lower due to our efforts at the end of 2001 to match our planned spending with anticipated volume levels. We have taken various actions to reduce future capital expenditures over the past two years, including those related to the curtailment of our MD10 program (discussed in Consolidated Results above) and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase 19 MD11 aircraft from an affiliate of SAirGroup. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately $2.1 billion in future capital expenditures. During 2002, we continued to make investments in FedEx Grounds infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand FedEx Freight. See Capital Resources below for further discussion. Cash Used for Business Acquisitions. During 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc. that provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for FedEx Express in three U.S. locations. During 2001, we acquired FedEx Freight East for approximately $980 million with a combination of cash and FedEx common stock. During 2000, we acquired three businesses for approximately $264 million, primarily in cash. See Note 3 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of business combinations. Free Cash Flow. Cash flow from operations during 2002 exceeded our cash used for investing activities creating free cash flow of $616 million, with which we paid off over $300 million in debt and repurchased treasury shares. The achievement of positive free cash flow is attributable to management of capital expenditures and working capital. Positive free cash flow indicates excess funds are available to invest in operations, reduce outstanding debt and provide return on capital to our shareholders. Debt Financing Activities. At April 1, 2002, certain existing debt at FedEx Express matured, principally $175 million of 9.875% Senior Notes. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we prepaid the remaining $101 million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of FedEx Freight East. In the third quarter of 2001, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches: three, five and ten years, at $250 million each. Net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness, principally borrowings under our commercial paper program, and for general corporate purposes. These notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. 54 Table of Contents We currently have $1 billion in revolving bank credit facilities that are generally used to finance temporary operating cash requirements and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of May 31, 2002, we had no commercial paper outstanding and the entire credit facilities were available. For more information regarding these credit facilities, see Note 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements. During 2002, we filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing. Under this shelf registration statement we may issue, in one or more offerings, either unsecured debt securities, common stock, or a combination of such instruments. Cash Used for Share Repurchases. We repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock in 2002, at a cost of approximately $177 million, under our 5.0 million share repurchase program. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us to buy back an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock. There were no treasury share repurchases during 2001 and, during 2000, cash flows were affected by approximately $607 million from the repurchase of 15 million shares. Other Liquidity Information. We will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to achieve positive free cash flow in the future. We believe that cash flow from operations, our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future. CAPITAL RESOURCES We have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems. In recent years, we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Trade Networks. The sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until 2002. With the infrastructure and operating systems now largely in place, we have been able to reduce our capital spending, including equivalent capital (as defined below), since 2000. Despite the decrease in capital spending, our operations remain capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment, package handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including preexisting contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, competition, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities. The following table compares capital expenditures (including equivalent capital) for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Aircraft and related equipment $ 730 $ 756 $ 469 Facilities and sort equipment 292 353 437 Information and technology investments 240 406 378 Vehicles and other equipment 353 378 343 Total capital expenditures 1,615 1,893 1,627 Equivalent capital, principallyaircraft related 365 Total $ 1,615 $ 1,893 $ 1,992 (See Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment.) 55 Table of Contents In 2002, in spite of capital spending related to the 2001 addition of FedEx Freight East, as well as scheduled deliveries of aircraft that were planned and committed to well before the economic slowdown, managements cost reduction actions resulted in a decrease in capital spending compared to both 2001 and 2000. For 2003, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.9 billion, as we are required to take 17 aircraft committed to in prior years. Because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft, we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance. Therefore, we must make projections regarding our needed airlift capacity many years before aircraft are actually needed. We will continue to manage our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels, and defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible in order to achieve positive cash flow. On July 12, 2002, FedEx Express entered into an agreement with AVSA, S.A.R.L. for the purchase of ten Airbus A380 800F aircraft, a new high capacity, long range airplane. We expect to take delivery of three of the ten aircraft in each of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 and the remaining one in 2011. The total commitment under the agreement approximates $2 billion. Most of the purchase price of each aircraft is due upon delivery of the aircraft. The agreement also provides for an option to purchase an additional ten aircraft. We have historically financed our long term capital investments through the use of lease, debt and equity financing in addition to the use of internally generated cash from operations. The determination to lease versus buy equipment is a financing decision, and all forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for capital. The amount we would have expended to purchase these assets had we not chosen to obtain their use through operating leases (leases with terms in excess of 50% of the assets useful life) is considered equivalent capital in the table above and is included in our internal capital budget. We had no equivalent capital expenditures during 2002 or 2001. We finance a significant amount of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of off balance sheet financing). Certain of these operating leases were arranged using special purpose entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry. At the time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity and after tax cash flows. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements as well as in Contractual Cash Obligations below. Credit rating agencies routinely use the information concerning our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. Furthermore, our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases. In the future, other forms of secured financing may be pursued to finance aircraft acquisitions if we determine that it best suits our needs. We have been successful in obtaining investment capital, both domestic and international, for long term leases on acceptable terms, although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs. For information on our purchase commitments, see Note 15 of the accompanying audited financial statements, as well as the table below. 56 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2002.

(4) Does not include commitments made on July 12, 2002 for purchase of Airbus A380 aircraft. In addition, we have other commercial commitments incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required under certain self insurance programs. While the notional amounts of these instruments are material, there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the liabilities for these self insurance programs are already reflected in our balance sheet as accrued expenses and other long term liabilities. We also have guarantees, amounting to $137 million at May 31, 2002, under certain operating leases for the residual values of aircraft, vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods. These guarantees are not reflected in our balance sheet since they are not currently considered probable; therefore, they do not represent liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION Since the beginning of the European Unions transition to the euro on January 1, 1999, our subsidiaries have been prepared to quote rates to customers, generate billings and accept payments, in both euro and legacy currencies. The legacy currencies remained legal tender through January 1, 2002. We did not experience a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows from the introduction of the euro and any price transparency brought about by its introduction and the phasing out of the legacy currencies. Costs associated with the euro project were expensed as incurred and were funded entirely by internal cash flows. 57 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Report (including the information incorporated by reference in this Report) contains forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of FedEx. Forward looking statements include those preceded by, followed by or that include the words believes, expects, anticipates, estimates or similar expressions. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements, because of, among other things, potential risks and uncertainties, such as: the impact of the events of September 11, 2001, or any subsequent terrorist activities, on the United States and global economies in general, or the transportation industry in particular, and what effects these events will have on our costs or the demand for our services; economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including the timing, speed and magnitude of the economys recovery from the downturn that began in calendar 2001 in the sectors that drive demand for our services; our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses and match them, especially those relating to aircraft, vehicle and sort capacity, to shifting customer volume levels; market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives, including our residential home delivery service; sudden changes in fuel prices; the timing and amount of any money we are entitled to receive under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act; competition from other providers of transportation and logistics services; our ability to compete with new or improved services offered by our competitors; changes in customer demand patterns; our ability to obtain and maintain aviation rights in important international markets; changes in government regulation, weather and technology; availability of financing on terms acceptable to us; and other risks and uncertainties you can find in our press releases and SEC filings. As a result of these and other factors, no assurance can be given as to our future results and achievements. Accordingly, a forward looking statement is not a prediction of future events or circumstances, and those future events or circumstances may not occur. You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report or the date of the document incorporated by reference in this Report. We are under no obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 58 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates are fixed. We have outstanding long term debt (exclusive of capital leases) of $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion at May 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Market risk for fixed rate, long term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $49 million as of May 31, 2002 and $55 million as of May 31, 2001. The underlying fair values of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. Currently, derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk. While we are a global provider of transportation services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by foreign currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Foreign currency fluctuations during 2002 did not have a material effect on our results of operations. At May 31, 2002, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $30 million for the year ending May 31, 2003 (the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately $70 million). This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In practice, our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations. Therefore, the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results, changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. We have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel; however, this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges. In 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges, which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices. Therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount. For 2001, market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected 2002 usage and amounted to approximately $100 million, net of hedging settlements. As of May 31, 2001, all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts. See Notes 1 and 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 59 Table of Contents
