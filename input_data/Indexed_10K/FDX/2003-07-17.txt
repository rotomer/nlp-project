Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition GENERAL The following managements discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, as well as the critical accounting policies, of FedEx Corporation (also referred to as "FedEx"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements, which include additional information about our significant accounting policies, practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results. FedEx is one of the largest transportation companies in the world. Our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units. These business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments: FedEx Express, the worlds largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground, North Americas second largest provider of small package ground delivery service; and FedEx Freight, the largest U.S. provider of regional less than truckload ("LTL") freight services. Our diversified portfolio of services has allowed FedEx to continue to generate revenue and earnings growth during challenging economic times. The key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks, as measured by our average daily volume; the mix of services purchased by our customers; the prices we obtain for our services, as measured by average price per shipment (yield); our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits, fuel and maintenance; and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels. Except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended May 31, 2003 or ended May 31 of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS The following table compares revenues, operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2003 2002 2001(1) 2003/ 2002 2002/ 2001 Revenues $ 22,487 $ 20,607 $ 19,629 +9 +5 Operating income $ 1,471 $ 1,321 $ 1,071 +11 +23 Operating margin 6.5% 6.4% 5.5% Net income $ 830 $ 710 (2) $ 584 +17 +22 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.74 $ 2.34 $ 1.99 +17 +18 (1)Results for 2001 include noncash charges of $102 million for impairment of certain assets related to aircraft programs at FedEx Express and a $22 million reorganization charge at FedEx Supply Chain Services. These charges were $78 million after tax or $0.27 per diluted share. See Notes 19 and 21 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (2)Results for 2002 reflect our adoption of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." We recognized an adjustment of $25 million ($15 million or $0.05 per share, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of certain goodwill to its implied fair value. See Note 4 to the accompanying audited financial statements. 36 Revenue growth during 2003 was attributable to the continued substantial growth of our FedEx Ground business, increased international volumes at FedEx Express and higher revenues at FedEx Freight. Increased U.S. freight volumes at FedEx Express also contributed to consolidated revenue growth, as we benefited from a full twelve months of revenue under the transportation agreement with the U.S. Postal Service ("USPS"), which commenced in late August 2001. During 2002, revenue growth reflected a 21% increase at FedEx Ground and increased U.S. freight volumes from the USPS agreement. In 2002, volume levels in our FedEx Express U.S. domestic and international package services declined as a result of weakness in the U.S. and global economies (particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors) and the impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Operating income increased 11% in 2003 as FedEx Ground improved its operating margin to 14.5%, which more than offset a decline in the operating margin at FedEx Express. The sluggish economy, combined with significant increases in pension and healthcare costs and higher maintenance expenses, reduced profitability at FedEx Express in 2003 despite continued cost control efforts. Variable compensation declined in 2003 based on below plan performance at FedEx Express. During 2002, operating income increased 23%, largely due to the contributions of FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and the fact that 2001 included approximately $124 million in noncash charges (discussed below). Discretionary spending (such as professional fees and travel related expenses) stayed relatively flat in 2003, as cost control remained a focus. During 2002, discretionary spending was approximately $108 million lower. Pension costs were approximately $80 million higher in 2003 on top of a $90 million increase in 2002, due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets. Although not required, we made additional contributions exceeding $1 billion to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans during 2003 to ensure that our pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our February 28, 2003 plan measurement date. During 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel. Higher net fuel costs negatively affected operating income during 2003, as fuel surcharge revenue increases did not keep pace with rising fuel prices. Although still negative for the year, the net impact of higher fuel prices on 2003 earnings was mitigated during the fourth quarter as fuel prices declined faster than the decrease in fuel surcharge revenue. Lower fuel prices during 2002 had a positive impact on operating expenses; however, declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income. We effectively closed jet fuel hedging contracts at the end of 2001 by entering into offsetting contracts. The maturity of these contracts increased 2002 fuel costs by approximately $15 million. During 2001, as a result of lower U.S. domestic volumes at FedEx Express and lower capacity growth forecasts, we committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our MD10 program (which upgrades and modifies our older DC10 aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer MD11 aircraft). By curtailing the MD10 program, we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through 2008. During 2001, we also took actions to reorganize our FedEx Supply Chain Services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable, non strategic logistics business and reduce its overhead. In addition, due to the bankruptcy of Ayres Corporation, we wrote off deposits and related items in 2001 in connection with the Ayres ALM200 aircraft program. Following is a summary of these pretax charges (in millions): Impairment of certain assets related to the MD10 aircraft program $ 93 Strategic realignment of logistics subsidiary 22 Ayres program write off 9 Total $ 124 37 Results for 2002 were favorably affected by approximately $12 million, related to the charges above, based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates. No material amounts remained on our balance sheet for these items at the end of 2002. The performance of FedEx Ground and revenue growth from FedEx Freight East (which was acquired in the third quarter of 2001) contributed to improved net income for 2003 and 2002, but was mitigated by continued softness in U.S. domestic package volumes at FedEx Express over the last two fiscal years. Results for 2002 also reflect the cessation of $36 million of goodwill amortization, as required under the new accounting rules for goodwill adopted June 1, 2001, that would have been recorded in operating expenses. Goodwill amortization expense was $26 million for 2001. Other Income and Expense and Income Taxes Net interest expense was 15% lower in 2003 due to reduced borrowings. In 2002, net interest expense was slightly lower, as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year (see "Financial Condition"). In 2002, other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately $17 million from the early retirement of debt assumed in the FedEx Freight East acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations. Our effective tax rate was 38.0% in 2003, 37.5% in 2002 and 37.0% in 2001. The 38.0% effective tax rate in 2003 was higher due to lower state taxes in 2002. The 37.5% effective tax rate in 2002 was higher than the 2001 effective rate, primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in 2001. The 2002 rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization and by several other factors, none of which were individually significant. The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory U.S. federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes. For 2004, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 38.0%. The actual rate, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income. Airline Stabilization Compensation Operations in 2002 were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. During 2002, we recognized a total of $119 million of compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (the "Act"), of which $101 million has been received as of May 31, 2003. The amounts recognized were for our estimate of losses we incurred as a result of the mandatory grounding of our aircraft and for incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001. All amounts recognized were reflected as reduction of operating expense under the caption "Airline stabilization compensation." In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Department of Transportation ("DOT") asserted that we were overpaid by $31.6 million and has demanded repayment. We have filed requests for administrative and judicial review of this determination. We believe that we have complied with all aspects of the Act, that it is probable we will ultimately collect the remaining $18 million receivable and that we will not be required to pay any portion of the DOTs $31.6 million demand. We cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome; however, it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the $119 million of compensation we have previously recognized under the Act could occur. 38 Cost Savings Initiatives On June 2, 2003, FedEx Express announced it will offer voluntary early retirement and severance programs during 2004 to continue resizing the FedEx Express U.S. organization and improving profitability. The first program will offer voluntary early retirement incentives, with enhanced pension and postretirement healthcare benefits, to certain groups of employees who are age 50 or older. The second program will offer voluntary severance incentives to eligible employees. Both programs are limited to eligible U.S. salaried staff employees and managers at FedEx Express. Depending on employee acceptance rates, the pretax charge for these programs is estimated to be $230 million to $290 million in 2004, with most of the charge to be incurred in the first half of the year. Approximately one third of the pretax charge will be cash. The remainder of the costs relate primarily to pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities. The cost of these programs will be reflected as a separate component of operating expenses. The estimated savings from these programs are expected to be $100 million to $130 million in 2004, primarily in the second half of the year. Thus, the net cost of these programs in 2004 is expected to be $130 million to $160 million. In 2005 and beyond, the estimated annual savings from these programs are expected to be $150 million to $190 million. The savings from these programs will be reflected primarily in lower ongoing salaries, wages and benefit costs. Over the past few years, we have taken many steps to bring our expense growth in line with revenue growth, particularly at FedEx Express, while maintaining our industry leading service levels. We have significantly decreased capital expenditures by reducing aircraft orders, consolidating facilities and discontinuing low value programs. The voluntary early retirement and severance programs are another step in this ongoing process of reducing our cost structure in order to increase our competitiveness, meet the future needs of our employees and provide the expected financial returns for our shareholders. Outlook During 2004, we expect the U.S. economy to remain sluggish at least through our first quarter, with year over year economic improvement expected to be evident in our second half results. We believe the fundamentals for domestic economic acceleration in the U.S. economy are in place, including supportive conditions in the overall financial markets, the recently approved tax stimulus package, continued accommodative monetary policy and improved consumer confidence. Our management teams are focusing on sizing our network for current economic conditions, improving our service offerings, enhancing the customer experience and positioning FedEx to take full advantage of an economic recovery. We continue to believe we are well positioned for long term growth when the economy, particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, recovers and experiences sustained growth. For 2004, we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of a sustained economic recovery during the second half of 2004 are realized. Our revenue growth strategies will leverage our "compete collectively" philosophy. FedEx Ground will continue its six year expansion plan and FedEx Freight will continue to enhance its portfolio of services. 39 Increasing pension and healthcare expenses, as well as the net costs of our voluntary early retirement and severance programs, will negatively impact operating margins during 2004. We expect our net pension cost for 2004 will increase by approximately $115 million based on a continued decline in interest rates, negative asset returns and a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets from 10.10% to 9.10%. Despite these increases in employee retirement costs, our retirement programs continue to be adequately funded with assets more than sufficient to meet our current obligations. See further discussion in "Critical Accounting Policies." During 2003, we announced to our employees that the FedEx Corporation Employees Pension Plan would be amended to add a cash balance feature, which we call the Portable Pension Account. Eligible employees as of May 31, 2003 may make a one time election to accrue future pension benefits under either the new cash balance formula or the traditional pension benefit formula. This election is entirely optional. In either case, employees will retain all benefits previously accrued under the traditional pension benefit formula and will continue to receive the benefit of future salary increases on benefits accrued as of May 31, 2003. Eligible employees hired after May 31, 2003 will participate in the Portable Pension Account. While this new program will provide employees greater flexibility and reduce our long term pension costs, it will not have a material effect on 2004 results. We believe our long term growth strategy will provide improved profits from increases in shipping by high tech and high value added businesses and the globalization of the economy. Our long term corporate financial objectives are to increase cash flow and financial returns by improving our operating margin, principally at FedEx Express, and through continued growth at our FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments. We plan to accomplish this goal by increasing volumes and by matching our cost structure and capital expenditures to expected business levels. At FedEx Express, we expect operating margin improvement will require a return to consistent growth in those sectors of the U.S. economy that most use domestic express air transportation. Margin growth will also depend on increasing volumes of heavier packages at higher yields and a rational pricing environment. Future results will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing, speed and magnitude of the U.S. domestic economic recovery, the extent to which eligible employees participate in our voluntary early retirement and severance programs, the impact from any terrorist activities or international conflicts, our ability to match our cost structure and capacity with shifting volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives. In addition, adjustments to our fuel surcharges lag changes in actual jet and diesel fuel prices paid. Therefore, our operating income could be materially affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or should we be unable to further increase our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel prices due to competitive pressures. Although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming, as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may ultimately have on our results of operations. See "Forward Looking Statements" for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance. 40 Seasonality of Business Our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature. Historically, the U.S. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late November and December. International business, particularly in the Asia to U.S. market, peaks in October and November due to U.S. holiday sales. Our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday seasons, have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods. The transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies. Seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage, revenues and earnings. Normally, the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for FedEx Ground and FedEx Custom Critical, while the latter part of December, January, June and July of each year are the slowest periods. For FedEx Freight, the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of December, January and February of each year are the slowest periods. Shipment levels, operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS A number of new accounting pronouncements were enacted during 2003, mostly in connection with attempts to improve the transparency of financial reporting. None of these new pronouncements had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during 2003. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements for discussion of these recent accounting pronouncements. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, each of which operates in a single line of business. Included within "Other" are the operations of FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx Services. "Other" also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations. Management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income. FedEx Services provides the customer facing sales, marketing and information technology functions, primarily for our FedEx Express and FedEx Ground reportable segments. The costs for these activities are allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided. These allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions. The line item "Intercompany charges" on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from FedEx Services to FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and certain other costs such as corporate management fees. In addition, "Intercompany charges" also includes allocated charges to our operating companies for management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight, executive officers and certain legal and finance functions. We believe the total amounts allocated reasonably reflect the cost of providing such services. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of our reportable segments. 41  FEDEX EXPRESS The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) and selected statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/ 2002 2002/ 2001 Revenues: Package: U.S. overnight box $ 5,432 $ 5,338 $ 5,830 + 2 8 U.S. overnight envelope 1,715 1,755 1,871 2 6 U.S. deferred 2,510 2,383 2,492 + 5 4 Total U.S. domestic package revenue 9,657 9,476 10,193 + 2 7 International Priority (IP) 4,367 3,834 3,940 +14 3 Total package revenue 14,024 13,310 14,133 + 5 6 Freight: U.S. 1,564 1,273 651 +23 +96 International 400 384 424 + 4 9 Total freight revenue 1,964 1,657 1,075 +19 +54 Other 363 360 326 + 1 +10 Total revenues 16,351 15,327 15,534 + 7 1 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 6,855 6,467 6,301 + 6 + 3 Purchased transportation 608 562 584 + 8 4 Rentals and landing fees 1,548 1,524 1,419 + 2 + 7 Depreciation and amortization 801 806 797 1 + 1 Fuel 1,231 1,009 1,063 +22 5 Maintenance and repairs 1,084 980 968 +11 + 1 Airline stabilization compensation (119 ) n/a n/a Intercompany charges 1,347 1,332 1,317 + 1 + 1 Other(1) 2,091 1,955 2,238 + 7 13 Total operating expenses 15,565 14,516 14,687 + 7 1 Operating income $ 786 $ 811 $ 847 3 4 Operating margin 4.8 % 5.3 % 5.5 % Package statistics: Average daily package volume (ADV): U.S. overnight box 1,176 1,170 1,264 + 1 7 U.S. overnight envelope 679 699 757 3 8 U.S. deferred 897 868 899 + 3 3 Total U.S. domestic ADV 2,752 2,737 2,920 + 1 6 IP 369 340 346 + 9 2 Total ADV 3,121 3,077 3,266 + 1 6 Revenue per package (yield): U.S. overnight box $ 18.18 $ 17.90 $ 18.09 + 2 1 U.S. overnight envelope 9.95 9.84 9.69 + 1 + 2 U.S. deferred 11.02 10.77 10.87 + 2 1 U.S. domestic composite 13.82 13.58 13.69 + 2 1 IP 46.59 44.16 44.70 + 6 1 Composite package yield 17.69 16.96 16.97 + 4 Freight statistics: Average daily freight pounds: U.S. 8,969 7,736 4,337 +16 +78 International 2,174 2,082 2,208 + 4 6 Total average daily freight pounds 11,143 9,818 6,545 +13 +50 Revenue per pound (yield): U.S. $ .69 $ .65 $ .59 + 6 +10 International .72 .72 .75 4 Composite freight yield .69 .66 .64 + 5 + 3 (1)2001 includes a $93 million charge for impairment of the MD10 aircraft program and a $9 million charge for the Ayres program write off. 42  FedEx Express Revenues FedEx Express total revenues increased 7% in 2003, largely due to increased IP and U.S. freight revenues. Year over year revenue comparisons reflect the impact in 2002 of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, which adversely affected both U.S. outbound international shipments and U.S. domestic shipments, and the economic decline that began in calendar 2001. Higher U.S. freight revenues from increased average daily pounds during 2003 also affected year over year revenue comparisons, as we benefited from a full twelve months of operations and higher shipping levels under our transportation contract with the USPS. During 2003, total package revenue increased 5%, due to increases in IP volumes and yield. IP volume growth occurred predominantly in Asia and Europe, which experienced average daily volume growth rates of 21% and 11%, respectively, during 2003. In the United States, package revenue increased 2% in 2003 due to higher yield and volumes in the U.S. deferred and U.S. overnight box categories. Total average daily package volumes for 2003 were at levels experienced in 1998. Average daily volumes decreased during 2002 in virtually all package categories, resulting in a 6% decrease in total package revenue. While IP volumes decreased 2% in 2002, principally due to a decline in U.S. outbound shipments, the European and Asian markets positively impacted IP volumes. For 2002, FedEx Express experienced IP average daily volume growth rates of 15% and 5% in the European and Asian markets, respectively. Yields at FedEx Express increased in 2003 in nearly all service categories and composite average weight per package was flat. The increase in U.S. domestic package yield during 2003 was due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and average list price increases. For U.S. domestic shipments and U.S. outbound international shipments, an average list price increase of 3.5% became effective January 6, 2003. IP yield improvements during 2003 were due to favorable exchange rate differences, increased fuel surcharge revenue and growth in higher yielding lanes. Package yields in 2002 were slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. Fuel surcharge revenue was higher in 2003 due to higher jet fuel prices and the introduction of a dynamic international fuel surcharge in September 2002. Our fuel surcharge is based on the spot price for jet fuel. During 2002, fuel surcharge revenue was lower compared to 2001 because our dynamic index for determining our U.S. domestic fuel surcharge was not implemented until the second quarter of 2002. Using this index, the U.S. domestic fuel surcharge ranged between 2.0% and 5.5% during 2003 and between 0% and 3% from November 2001 through May 2002. The fuel surcharge during all of 2001 was 4%. International fuel surcharges were as high as 6% during 2003. Total freight revenue for 2003 and 2002 increased significantly due to higher U.S. freight volume and yield, reflecting the impact of the USPS transportation agreement, which began in August 2001 and runs through August 2008. During 2003, FedEx Express entered into a third addendum to the transportation agreement with the USPS, allowing FedEx Express to continue carrying incremental pounds of mail through May 29, 2004 at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement. 43 FedEx Express Operating Income During 2003, the 3% decrease in operating income and the decline in operating margin at FedEx Express was attributable to increased employee benefit costs, higher maintenance expenses and, to a lesser extent, the net impact of higher fuel costs in an economic environment of sluggish U.S. domestic average daily package volumes. The decrease in operating income was also somewhat attributable to one fewer operating day during the year. Operating results during 2003 were impacted by unusually inclement weather during the winter and spring, which decreased business shipping, reduced operational efficiency and increased certain operating costs, such as for snow removal and de icing. In 2002, operating income at FedEx Express decreased 4% as package volume declines on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions. Excluding $102 million of asset impairment charges taken in 2001, operating income was down 15% in 2002. In 2001, operating income decreases reflected charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter (see "Consolidated Results"). Salaries, wages and benefits were higher during 2003 and 2002 due to wage rate increases and higher pension and healthcare costs. Also, the increase was partially the result of cost increases related to the USPS contract. Incentive compensation provisions declined in 2003 and 2002 based on below plan performance. Fuel consumption was higher in 2003 and 2002, primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental U.S. freight pounds transported under the USPS agreement and IP volume growth. During 2003, fuel costs were higher, due to a 16% increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel. Higher net fuel costs at FedEx Express negatively affected operating income during 2003 by $24 million, as fuel surcharge revenue increases were not sufficient to offset higher jet fuel prices. Fuel costs were down during 2002, due to a 12% decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel. During 2002, lower fuel surcharge revenue, net of the impact of lower fuel prices, negatively impacted operating income by $32 million. During 2001, higher jet fuel prices negatively affected operating income by approximately $150 million, including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts. Maintenance expenses were higher during 2003, primarily due to the timing of scheduled maintenance events. Depreciation and amortization expense declined during 2003 reflecting a trend of decreasing levels of capital spending, as well as changes in estimated useful lives and salvage values. During 2002, rentals and landing fees were higher primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental U.S. freight volume. Operating income for 2002 also reflects the adoption of new rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets. For FedEx Express, adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of $12 million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during 2002 (this amortization amount was comparable to 2001). During 2003, other operating expenses also increased at FedEx Express. In the prior year, reimbursements from the USPS for network expansion costs were reflected as credits to other operating expenses. These reimbursements, however, had no effect on operating income, as they represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred. Partially offsetting operating costs during 2003 was a gain from the insurance settlement on an aircraft destroyed in an accident in July 2002 that resulted in a net $8 million favorable impact on operating income. During 2002, other operating expenses included $27 million from the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. 44 FedEx Express Outlook We expect revenue to increase at FedEx Express during 2004, in both the domestic and international markets. During 2004, we expect the U.S. economy to remain sluggish at least through our first fiscal quarter, with year over year improvement expected to be evident in our second half results. We believe the fundamentals for domestic economic acceleration in the U.S. economy are in place and, as a result, we expect to see improvements in both yields and volumes. Pension, healthcare and maintenance expenses are expected to continue to increase at a faster rate than revenue growth. On June 2, 2003, we announced that FedEx Express will offer voluntary early retirement and severance programs during 2004 to continue resizing the FedEx Express U.S. organization and improving profitability. See "Cost Savings Initiatives" for further discussion of these programs. While the net cost of these programs is expected to negatively impact operating margin in 2004, we expect margins at FedEx Express will begin to increase in 2005 due to these and other efforts. Our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued aggressive cost management actions and a return to solid growth in our U.S. overnight box volumes related to anticipated improvements in the economy. These cost management actions and improved volumes, along with a sharp focus on productivity, are expected to produce improved operational efficiency as volume growth is absorbed with minimal increases in operating costs. FEDEX GROUND The following table compares revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margin (dollars in millions) and selected package statistics (in thousands, except yield amounts) for the years ended May 31: Percent Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/ 2002 2002/ 2001 Revenues $ 3,413 $ 2,711 $ 2,237 + 26 +21 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 637 532 450 + 20 +18 Purchased transportation 1,294 1,032 881 + 25 +17 Rentals 79 71 67 + 11 + 6 Depreciation and amortization 153 132 111 + 16 +19 Fuel 11 4 8 +175 50 Maintenance and repairs 86 73 63 + 18 +16 Intercompany charges 329 238 215 + 38 +11 Other 329 292 267 +13 + 9 Total operating expenses 2,918 2,374 2,062 + 23 +15 Operating income $ 495 $ 337 $ 175 + 47 +93 Operating margin 14.5 % 12.4 % 7.8 % Average daily package volume 2,168 1,755 1,520 + 24 +15 Revenue per package (yield) $ 6.25 $ 6.11 $ 5.79 + 2 + 6 45 FedEx Ground Revenues FedEx Ground realized double digit revenue growth in both 2003 and 2002 due to increased volumes in our business to business shipments and continued growth of our home delivery service. During 2003, FedEx Home Delivery added facilities to reach nearly 100% coverage of the U.S. population. Yield at FedEx Ground increased in 2003, due to an average list price increase of 3.9%, which became effective January 6, 2003. Partially offsetting the effect of the price increase were higher levels of discounts and lower average weight per package. In 2002, year over year yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases, ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages. In the third quarter of 2002, FedEx Ground implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge, based on the spot price for on highway diesel fuel. This surcharge ranged between 0.75% and 2.00% during 2003 and between 0.50% and 0.75% from February through May 2002. FedEx Ground Operating Income FedEx Ground experienced revenue and earnings growth during 2003 and 2002. Operating margins improved in 2003 in spite of increased intercompany charges for sales, marketing, customer support and information technology costs. Operating expenses in most categories increased at a lower rate than the growth in revenues during 2003. In addition, FedEx Ground realized substantial improvements in pick up and delivery and linehaul productivity. During 2003, salaries and employee benefits increased due to higher pension costs and increases in staffing to support volume growth. Operating results during 2003 were also impacted by inclement weather during the winter and spring, which was more severe than in previous years. The increase in operating income in 2002 was primarily attributable to package volume growth, higher yields, productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management. Facility openings and expansions, as well as increased investments in information systems, resulted in increased depreciation, rental and other property related expenses during 2002. Salaries, wages and benefits also were higher in 2002 due to additional full time equivalents and higher pension and healthcare costs. Costs for variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during 2002, reflecting FedEx Grounds outstanding financial performance. The increase in operating income in both 2003 and 2002 was also attributable to improved home delivery service results. In September 2002, FedEx Home Delivery completed the build out of its national network, enabling it to reach nearly 100% of U.S. residences, with evening, weekend and day and time specific delivery options, all backed by a money back guarantee. Our home delivery service became profitable during 2003. This service had an operating loss of $32 million during 2002 and $52 million during 2001. FedEx Grounds 2001 results also reflect rebranding and reorganization expenses of $15 million, which were expensed as incurred and consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans, trailers and signage. 46 FedEx Ground Outlook We expect revenue at FedEx Ground will continue to grow in 2004, although at a slower rate than in 2003 and 2002. We will continue to pursue revenue growth in all services, led by increased home delivery and overnight ground package volumes. Overall yield improvement will be a primary focus as we continue to expect a very competitive pricing environment. FedEx Ground will also continue to place emphasis on improving on time delivery, productivity and safety. During 2004, we expect capital spending will grow significantly at FedEx Ground as we continue to focus on network capacity expansion. We also expect higher pension costs, higher facility expenses due to expansion and increases in intercompany allocations for sales, marketing, customer support and information technology costs. We expect the 2004 operating margin will be comparable to 2003. FEDEX FREIGHT The following table shows revenues, operating expenses and operating income and margins (dollars in millions) and selected statistics for the years ended May 31: 2003 2002 2001(1) Percent Change 2003/2002 Revenues $ 2,120 $ 1,960 $ 835 + 8 Operating expenses: Salaries and employee benefits 1,255 1,170 489 + 7 Purchased transportation 68 57 23 +19 Rentals 65 64 27 + 2 Depreciation and amortization 83 86 44 3 Fuel 89 72 41 +24 Maintenance and repairs 113 90 39 +26 Intercompany charges 13 8 1 +63 Other 256 245 116 + 4 Total operating expenses 1,942 1,792 780 + 8 Operating income $ 178 $ 168 $ 55 + 6 Operating margin 8.4 % 8.6 % 6.6 % Average daily shipments (in thousands)(2) 56 56 56 Weight per shipment (lbs)(2) 1,114 1,114 1,132 Yield (Revenue per hundredweight)(2) $ 13.40 $ 12.41 $ 11.83 + 8 (1)Results for 2001 include the financial results of FedEx Freight West from December 1, 2000 and of FedEx Freight East from January 1, 2001 (the date of acquisition for financial reporting purposes). Therefore, 2001 results are not comparable to 2002. (2)Statistics for 2001 are based on the portion of the year including both FedEx Freight West and FedEx Freight East (January through May). FedEx Freight Revenues Revenues at FedEx Freight increased during 2003, despite the continued impact of a slow economy, severe winter weather and one fewer operating day during the year. The increase in revenue was attributable to improved yields during 2003. Average daily shipments and weight per shipment were flat, while yield increased 8%. Contributing to the increase in yield during 2003 were the impact of a 5.9% general rate increase in July 2002, favorable contractual renewals, higher fuel surcharge revenue and additional volumes related to EZ Flyer, our premium priced, interregional freight service. 47 In 2002, revenues were higher due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations for FedEx Freight East. However, revenues were impacted by the economic slowdown and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge during 2002. In 2002, average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year, weight per shipment was down 2% and yield was up 5%. FedEx Freight Operating Income The increase in operating income at FedEx Freight during 2003 was attributable to revenue growth and cost management. Lower depreciation and amortization during 2003 reflects increased gains from the sale of operating assets in the ordinary course of business. Operating margins in 2003 reflect higher maintenance and repairs expenses, which include $14 million of expenses associated with rebranding FedEx Freight East and FedEx Freight West under the name "FedEx Freight." The rebranding project began in the fourth quarter of 2002 and is expected to be complete in 2005, with total rebranding costs of approximately $40 million to $45 million. These costs, which are being expensed as incurred, consist primarily of incremental external costs for rebranding tractors and trailers. During 2002, operating margins reflect the elimination of goodwill amortization, partially offset by $6 million of rebranding expenses. The increase in operating income during 2002 also reflects the inclusion of a full year of operations as well as the cessation of $15 million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses prior to the adoption of new accounting rules (as discussed in "Consolidated Results"). FedEx Freight Outlook We expect revenue to continue to grow in 2004, largely due to yield improvements and continued growth of higher yielding interregional and international services. In April 2003, we announced that we are offering ocean and ground service from Asia to virtually every continental U.S. ZIP code. This service helps reduce inventory cycle time with fast overall transit times and fewer processes than traditional ocean service from Asia. On June 17, 2003, we announced a general rate increase of 5.9% to be effective June 30, 2003. Volume growth, yield management, enhanced productivity and cost control measures continue to be major focus areas for FedEx Freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment. OTHER OPERATIONS Other operations include FedEx Custom Critical, a critical shipment carrier; FedEx Trade Networks, whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company; FedEx Services, a provider of sales, marketing and IT support, primarily for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, and a provider of supply chain management services; and intercompany revenue eliminations, which are not material. Also included in this category are the operating results of FedEx Freight West prior to December 1, 2000. 48 Revenues from other operations were $603 million in 2003 (down 1%) compared to $609 million in 2002 (down 40%) and $1.0 billion in 2001. In 2003, the slight decrease in revenues from our other operations reflects the termination of certain unprofitable supply chain services contracts, partially offset by increased revenues at FedEx Custom Critical. Revenues at FedEx Custom Critical were 12% higher in 2003, due to increased yields, and 24% lower in 2002, largely due to the economic downturn. The demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary (critical shipments) is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators, principally in the automotive industry, where volumes have been depressed since calendar 2001. A significant portion of the decrease in revenues from other operations during 2002 reflects the fact that 2002 results for this category no longer include FedEx Freight Wests revenues (see "FedEx Freight"). Operating income from other operations was $12 million in 2003 compared to $5 million in 2002 and an operating loss of $6 million in 2001. The improvement in operating income in 2003 was primarily attributable to FedEx Trade Networks. In 2002, the improvement over 2001 reflects reduced operating costs at FedEx Supply Chain Services. On March 1, 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc., which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for FedEx Express in three U.S. locations, at a cost of $36.5 million. FINANCIAL CONDITION LIQUIDITY Cash and cash equivalents totaled $538 million at May 31, 2003, compared to $331 million at May 31, 2002. The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,871 $ 2,228 $ 2,044 Cash used in investing activities: Capital investments and other (1,490 ) (1,577 ) (1,636 ) Business acquisitions (35 ) (477 ) 381 616 (69 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities: Principal payments on debt (10 ) (320 ) (650 ) Proceeds from debt issuances 744 Purchases of treasury stock (186 ) (177 ) Dividends paid (60 ) Other financing activities 82 91 28 Net increase in cash $ 207 $ 210 $ 53 The $357 million decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2003 reflected increased funding to our qualified pension plans, partially offset by improved earnings and lower levels of estimated federal income tax payments. Although not required, we made cash contributions to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans of $1.1 billion during 2003 (compared to $150 million in 2002 and $88 million in 2001). (See further discussion concerning our pension plan contributions in "Critical Accounting Policies.") In 2002, the increase in cash flows from operating activities reflected increases in earnings (which included FedEx Freight for an entire year) and aggressive working capital management. 49 Cash Used for Capital Investments. Capital expenditures were lower in 2003 due to managements cost reduction actions in 2001 and 2002, despite deliveries of aircraft during 2003 that were scheduled and committed to well before the economic slowdown. In 2002, capital expenditures were lower in spite of capital spending related to the 2001 addition of FedEx Freight East. See "Capital Resources" for further discussion. Cash Used for Business Acquisitions. During 2002, a subsidiary of FedEx Trade Networks acquired certain assets of Fritz Companies, Inc. at a cost of $36.5 million. During 2001, we acquired FedEx Freight East for approximately $980 million with a combination of cash and FedEx common stock. See Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions. Debt Financing Activities. From time to time, we finance certain operating and investing activities through the issuance of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under two revolving credit agreements, totaling $1 billion, and reduces the amount available under these agreements. During the third quarter of 2003, commercial paper borrowings of $200 million were necessary to finance part of the cash contribution to our qualified pension plans. All of the commercial paper borrowings were repaid by April 11, 2003. At May 31, 2003, no commercial paper was outstanding and the entire $1 billion under the revolving credit agreements was available for future borrowings. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at May 31, 2002. For more information regarding these credit facilities, see Note 6 of the accompanying audited financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2002, certain existing debt at FedEx Express matured, principally $175 million of 9.875% Senior Notes. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we prepaid the remaining $101 million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of FedEx Freight East. In the third quarter of 2001, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes. Net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness, principally borrowings under our commercial paper program, and for general corporate purposes. These notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations. During 2002, we filed a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing. Under this shelf registration statement we may issue, in one or more offerings, either unsecured debt securities, common stock or a combination of such instruments. The entire $1 billion is available for future financings. Cash Used for Share Repurchases. During 2002 and 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to buy back a total of 15.0 million shares of common stock. During 2003, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $56.66 per share and this decreased cash flows by $186 million. We repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock in 2002, at a cost of approximately $177 million or an average of $52.70 per share. There were no stock repurchases during 2001. A total of 8.0 million shares remain under existing share repurchase authorizations. Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared our first ever cash dividend on May 31, 2002. Total dividends paid in 2003 were $60 million. On June 2, 2003, our Board declared a dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, which we paid on July 1, 2003 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 12, 2003. We expect to continue quarterly dividend payments, although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors. 50 Other Liquidity Information. We have taken actions (discussed in "Results of Operations"), including the new Portable Pension Account option for eligible FedEx employees and resizing efforts at FedEx Express, which are expected to reduce our long term costs and cash outflows. We will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to manage our cash flow in the future. We believe that cash flow from operations, our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. CAPITAL RESOURCES We have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems. In recent years, we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Trade Networks. The sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant that we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until 2002. Despite the recent decrease in capital spending, our operations remain capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment, package handling facilities and sort equipment. The amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors, including preexisting contractual commitments, anticipated volume growth, domestic and international economic conditions, new or enhanced services, geographical expansion of services, competition, availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities. The following table compares capital expenditures for the years ended May 31 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Aircraft and related equipment $ 762 $ 730 $ 756 Facilities and sort equipment 254 292 353 Information and technology investments 273 288 406 Vehicles and other equipment 222 305 378 Total capital expenditures $ 1,511 $ 1,615 $ 1,893 (See Note 13 to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment.) Capital expenditures were 6% lower during 2003 and 15% lower in 2002. The majority of this decrease was primarily at FedEx Express, where capital expenditures were 15% and 14% lower in 2003 and 2002, respectively. During both years, we continued to make investments in FedEx Grounds infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand FedEx Freight. We took various actions in 2002 and 2001 in order to reduce future capital expenditures, including those related to the curtailment of our MD10 program (discussed in "Consolidated Results") and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase 19 MD11 aircraft. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately $2.1 billion in future capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures will be approximately $1.7 billion in 2004, with much of the year over year increase coming from the multi year capacity expansion of the FedEx Ground network. We expect that internally generated cash, as well as financing available through leasing transactions or borrowings, will be adequate to meet our future capital requirements. 51 Because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft, we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance. Therefore, we must make commitments regarding our airlift requirements many years before aircraft are actually needed. We are closely managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and will defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible, while continuing to invest strategically in growing business segments. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of May 31, 2003. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 There after Total (in millions) Amounts reflected in balance sheet: Long term debt(1) $ 275 $ 6 $ 257 $ 226 $ $ 831 $ 1,595 Capital lease obligations(2) 44 125 102 11 11 238 531 Other cash obligations not reflected in balance sheet: Operating leases 1,368 1,285 1,192 1,155 1,045 8,342 14,387 Unconditional purchase obligations(3) 446 275 227 268 231 1,993 3,440 Total cash obligations $ 2,133 $ 1,691 $ 1,778 $ 1,660 $ 1,287 $ 11,404 $ 19,953 (1)Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (2)Includes related interest. See Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements. (3)See Note 17 to the accompanying audited financial statements. We have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These contingent liabilities are not included in the table above. Amounts Reflected in Balance Sheet We have other commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including surety bonds and standby letters of credit. These instruments are generally required under certain U.S. domestic self insurance programs and are used in the normal course of international operations. While the notional amounts of these instruments are material, there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter of 2003, FedEx Express amended four leases for MD11 aircraft, which now commits FedEx Express to firm purchase obligations for two of these aircraft during both 2005 and 2006. As a result, the amended leases were accounted for as capital leases, which added $221 million to both long term assets and long term liabilities. 52 We have other long term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet, including deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and self insurance accruals. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2004 that are included in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in Balance Sheet The amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases (principally aircraft and facilities) with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at May 31, 2003. In the past, we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs (and certain other equipment needs) using operating leases (a type of "off balance sheet financing"). At the time that the decision to lease was made, we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values, liquidity and after tax cash flows. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements, as well as in the table above. Credit rating agencies routinely use this information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity. Furthermore, our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases. We have guarantees under certain operating leases, amounting to $134 million as of May 31, 2003, for the residual values of aircraft, vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods. Based upon our expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement, we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements. Accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees. See Note 15 to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications. Certain of these operating leases were arranged using variable interest entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry. As discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited financial statements, we expect to consolidate one of these entities in the second quarter of 2004 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46. We expect this consolidation to increase our long term assets and long term liabilities by approximately $140 million at September 1, 2003. Consolidation will not materially affect our results of operations and our debt covenants will not be adversely affected. In the future, other forms of secured financing and direct purchases may be used to obtain capital assets if we determine that they best suit our needs. We have been successful in obtaining investment capital, both domestic and international, for long term leases on acceptable terms, although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors. We believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions, including aircraft, and are adequate for our future capital needs. 53  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with our independent auditors. PENSION COST We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees. The accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates, including: discount rates; expected long term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; and employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages. We consider the most critical of these estimates to be our discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets (and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied) and the expected rate of future increases in salaries. For FedEx, the determination of a years pension cost is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans. For example, only 5% of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits and the average remaining service life of our employees approximates 14 years (normal retirement is at age 60). Therefore, the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future. This long time period increases the sensitivity of our annual pension cost to changes in these key estimates. Total pension costs increased approximately $80 million in 2003 and approximately $90 million in 2002 and are expected to increase an additional $115 million in 2004. Pension costs are included in the salaries, wages and benefits caption in our income statements. Following are the components of the pension cost recognized in our income statements (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Service cost $ 374 $ 348 $ 325 Interest cost 438 409 382 Expected return on plan assets (594 ) (621 ) (624 ) Net amortization and deferral 10 13 (23 ) $ 228 $ 149 $ 60 U.S. accounting standards recognize that changes in the many estimates required to account for pensions occur routinely and the accounting rules require the use of techniques to normalize the effects of these changes (typically over the average remaining service lives of our employees). For example, the difference between the estimated return on plan assets and the actual returns for the period are reflected as unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. If the aggregate amount of actuarial gains and losses exceeds a certain corridor level, the excess is amortized over future periods, increasing or decreasing pension costs 54 in those periods. The net amortization and deferral component of pension cost included in the table above reflects the impact of amortizing actuarial gains and losses on pension cost. In 2004, we expect this component of our pension cost to increase due to the impact of lower than expected returns on pension plan assets over the past three years. The anticipated increase in 2004 pension cost is attributable to the following factors (in millions): 2004 Decrease in discount rate $ 20 Reduction in expected return on plan assets 65 Net effect of the amortization of actuarial losses 55 Reduction in rate of salary increases and other (25 ) Net estimated increase in 2004 pension cost $ 115 Accounting standards also require immediate balance sheet recognition of additional pension obligations when the accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") exceeds the fair value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement date. During 2003, we made tax deductible contributions of $1.1 billion to our qualified U.S. domestic pension plans in order to fully fund the ABO of these plans. These contributions were not required under the minimum pension funding rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). Following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans (in millions): 2003 2002 Funded Status of Plans: Accumulated benefit obligation (ABO): Qualified U.S. domestic plans $ 5,725 $ 4,844 Other plans 284 253 Total ABO $ 6,009 $ 5,097 Projected benefit obligation (PBO) $ 7,117 $ 6,227 Fair value of plan assets 5,825 5,510 PBO in excess of plan assets (1,292 ) (717 ) Unrecognized actuarial losses, principally due to investments and changes in discount rate 2,247 823 Unamortized prior service cost and other 116 122 Amounts Included in Balance Sheet $ 1,071 $ 228 Components of Amounts Included in Balance Sheet: Prepaid pension cost $ 1,269 $ 411 Accrued pension liability (198 ) (183 ) Minimum pension liability (42 ) (19 ) Intangible asset and other 42 19 Net amounts recognized in balance sheet $ 1,071 $ 228 Cash Amounts: Cash contributions during the year $ 1,072 $ 161 Benefit payments during the year $ 103 $ 84 55 The funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state of our long term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date. Declining interest rates (which increase the discounted value of the PBO) and recent stock market losses have significantly impacted the funded status of our plans. However, our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets (benefit payments for 2003 were less than 2% of plan assets). In order to improve the funded status of our pension plans, we expect to continue to make tax deductible contributions to the plans in the future. Currently, we do not expect any material contributions for 2004 will be required under ERISA. We have also implemented the new Portable Pension Account (previously discussed in "Outlook"), which will help reduce the long term growth of our pension liabilities. The net amounts reflected in our balance sheet related to pension items include a substantial prepaid pension asset. This results from excess cash contributions to the plans over amounts that are recognized as pension expense for financial accounting purposes. Amounts accrued as liabilities (including minimum pension liabilities) relate primarily to unfunded nonqualified plans and international pension plans where additional funding may not provide a current tax deduction. Discount Rate. This is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date (the PBO) to their net present value. The discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date (February 28) and affects the succeeding years pension cost. A decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense. This assumption is highly sensitive for FedEx and a one basis point change in the discount rate at February 28, 2003 affects our 2004 pension expense by approximately $1.7 million and our 2003 ABO by approximately $10 million. For example, the 12 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 6.99% for 2004 from 7.11% for 2003 will negatively affect our 2004 pension cost by approximately $20 million. Our 2003 pension cost was negatively affected by approximately $60 million by the 63 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 7.11% for 2003 from 7.74% for 2002. We determine the discount rate (which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date) with the assistance of actuaries, who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments. This methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity. However, the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds. Plan Assets. Pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities. Our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in FedEx common stock. The estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long term, forward looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost. It is intended to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan assets. At February 28, 2003, with nearly $6 billion of plan assets, a one basis point change in this assumption affects pension cost by approximately $645,000 (a decrease in the assumed expected long term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense). 56 Establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter. Management considers the following factors in determining this assumption: The duration of our pension plan liabilities, which determines the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets. The types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the next 10 to 15 year time period (or such other time period that may be appropriate). The investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds. We review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. Also, we periodically commission detailed asset/liability studies performed by third party professional investment advisors and actuaries. These studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories. These studies also generate probability adjusted expected future returns on those assets. The study performed for 2003 supported the reasonableness of our 10.10% return assumption based on our liability duration and market conditions at the time we set this assumption. Because of the introduction of the Portable Pension Account for 2004 (which will reduce our liability duration over time), as well as the significant additional contributions we made into the plans in late 2003 and the continuing deterioration of the equity markets through February 28, 2003, we performed a more recent asset/liability study for 2004. The results of this study support our current asset allocation strategy, which is summarized below: Asset Class Target % of Plan Assets Domestic equities 53 % International equities 17 Private equities 5 Total equities 75 Long duration fixed income securities 15 Other fixed income securities 10 100 % The actual allocation of our assets at February 28, 2003 was weighted more toward fixed income securities due to the depressed value of our equity investments and uninvested cash contributions of $815 million made on February 28, 2003. The asset/liability study for 2004 supports a long term return on assets of at least 9.10%. Our actual compound return on assets was 9.10% for the 15 year period ended March 31, 2003. Based on these factors, we selected 9.10% as our estimated future rate of return on pension assets for 2004. The 100 basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return for 2004 will negatively affect our 2004 pension cost by approximately $65 million. Our 2003 pension cost was negatively affected by approximately $48 million by the 80 basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return to 10.10% for 2003 from 10.90% for 2002. 57 Investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied, which will further increase our pension cost in 2004. Cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses subject to amortization were approximately $1.5 billion through February 28, 2003. These unrecognized losses primarily reflect the decline in the stock market over the past three years and may be recovered in future periods. However, to the extent that market performance does not improve, these unrecognized losses are recognized in future periods in the net amortization and deferral component of pension expense. Pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date. We use a calculated value method, which helps mitigate short term volatility in market performance (both increases and decreases). The other acceptable method of valuing plan assets is to use the market value of the assets at the measurement date. The application of the calculated value accounting method reduced 2003 pension cost by approximately $35 million and 2002 pension cost by approximately $16 million compared to the market value method. Salary Increases. The assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost. We correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate (since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments) and general estimated levels of profitability (since most incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages). Currently, a one basis point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately $943,000 (a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost). The decrease in this assumption to 3.15% for 2004 from 3.25% will favorably impact 2004 pension cost by approximately $10 million. For 2003, the decrease in this assumption to 3.25% from 4.00% in 2002 favorably impacted pension cost by approximately $50 million. SELF INSURANCE ACCRUALS We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare programs. At May 31, 2003 there were approximately $937 million of self insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet ($839 million at May 31, 2002). The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. Other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. 58 LONG LIVED ASSETS Property and Equipment. Our key businesses are capital intensive. More than 60% of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures. We capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards. Accordingly, repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. The depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. Because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 18 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. This evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment. These estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. Historically, gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material (typically less than $10 million annually). However, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control. At various times during 2003, as studies were completed, we made changes to the useful lives and residual values of certain aircraft fleet types, as well as tractors, trailers and other equipment. These changes resulted in a decrease in 2003 depreciation expense of approximately $13 million. Had all of these changes been made as of June 1, 2002, depreciation expense for 2003 would have decreased by an additional $12 million. Because we must plan years in advance for future volume levels and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections, we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur. The accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. Because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets, and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations, we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used. However, from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. Assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. For example, in 2001 we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at FedEx Express related to our MD10 conversion program. The decision allowed us to avoid approximately $1.1 billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of $93 million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal. During 2002 we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired MD10 program assets, which resulted in a favorable adjustment of $9 million. See Notes 19 and 21 to the accompanying audited financial statements for more information concerning impairment charges. There were no material asset impairment charges recognized in 2003. 59 Leases. We utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft. Over the years, we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint. Such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. As disclosed in "Contractual Cash Obligations" and Note 7 to the accompanying audited financial statements, at May 31, 2003 we had approximately $14 billion (on an undiscounted basis) of future commitments for payments under operating leases. The future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases. The determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. We believe we have well defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation. During the fourth quarter of 2003, FedEx Express amended four leases for MD11 aircraft. As a result, the amended leases are now accounted for as capital leases, which added $221 million to both long term assets and long term liabilities at May 31, 2003. Goodwill. We have in excess of $1 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses. New accounting standards adopted in 2002 require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization. As previously indicated, the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of $25 million in 2002 at one of our smaller businesses. The annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values. Changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates. However, once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded, it cannot be reversed. We performed our annual impairment tests in 2003 with no indicated impairment to any of our goodwill balances. REVENUE RECOGNITION We believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing our overall financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace. Our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments. Our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational, billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue, bill customers and collect amounts due to us. We recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or, for our logistics and trade services businesses, upon the completion of services. Transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period: (1) recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or (2) recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred. We use the second method; we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred. We believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred. There are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above: (1) estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered; (2) estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit; and (3) estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts. 60 Unbilled Revenue. Primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers, there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice. At the end of a month, unprocessed invoices may be as much as one third of the total months revenue. This revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes. Invoices that are essentially complete represent most of these accruals, with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued. The remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment. These estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced. Because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes, the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced. Shipments in Process. The majority of our shipments have short cycle times; therefore, less than 5% of a total months revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period. We periodically perform studies to measure the percentage of completion for shipments in process. At month end, we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up, the scheduled day of delivery, the day of the week on which the month ends (which affects the percentage of completion) and current trends in our average price for the respective services. We believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period. Future Adjustments to Revenue and Accounts Receivable. Like many companies, we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable. Historically, our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective. We also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts, money back service guarantees and billing corrections. Estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts, adjustments processed and current collections trends. Total allowances for these future adjustments were $149 million at May 31, 2003 and $147 million at May 31, 2002. We consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate, as changes in economic conditions, pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk While we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates, we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates are fixed. As disclosed in Note 6 to the accompanying audited financial statements, we have outstanding long term debt (exclusive of capital leases) of $1.6 billion at May 31, 2003 and 2002. Market risk for fixed rate, long term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately $39 million as of May 31, 2003 and $49 million as of May 31, 2002. The underlying fair values of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities. Currently, derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk. While we are a global provider of transportation services, the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. Foreign currency fluctuations during 2003 did not have a material effect on our results of operations. At May 31, 2003, the result of a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately $36 million for 2004 (the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately $30 million). This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In practice, our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations. Therefore, the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results, changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. We have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel; however, this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges. In 2002, we implemented new indices for calculating U.S. domestic fuel surcharges, which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel. In 2003, we implemented this methodology for determining a fuel surcharge on international shipments as well. Therefore, a hypothetical 10% change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings. However, our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices and fuel prices can fluctuate within certain ranges before resulting in a change in our fuel surcharges. Therefore, our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change in our fuel surcharges. For 2001, market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected 2002 usage and amounted to approximately $100 million, net of hedging settlements. As of May 31, 2001, all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts. See Note 1 to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 63
