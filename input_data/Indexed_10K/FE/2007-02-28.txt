Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in other sections that include forward looking and other statements involving risks and uncertainties that could impact our business and financial results. Risks Related to Business Operations Risks Arising from the Reliability of Our Power Plants and Transmission and Distribution Equipment Operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves risk, including potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, accidents, labor disputes and performance below expected levels. In addition, weather related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, transmission and distribution delivery systems. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of those facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. 22 Operation of our power plants below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages may require us to incur significant replacement power costs. Moreover, if we were unable to perform under contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result. OE, CEI, and TE are exposed to losses under their applicable sale leaseback arrangements for generating facilities upon the occurrence of certain contingent events that could render those facilities worthless. Although we believe these types of events are unlikely to occur, OE, CEI and TE each have a maximum exposure to loss under those provisions of approximately $1 billion. We remain obligated to provide safe and reliable service to customers within our franchised service territories. Meeting this commitment requires the expenditure of significant capital resources. Failure to provide safe and reliable service and failure to meet regulatory reliability standards due to a number of factors, including equipment failure and weather, could adversely affect our operating results through reduced revenues and increased capital and maintenance costs and the imposition of penalties/fines or other adverse regulatory outcomes. Changes in Commodity Prices Could Adversely Affect Our Profit Margins While much of our generation currently serves customers under retail rates set by regulatory bodies, we also purchase and sell electricity in the competitive wholesale and retail markets. Increases in the costs of fuel for our generation facilities (particularly coal and natural gas) can affect our profit margins in both competitive and non competitive markets. Changes in the market prices of electricity, which are affected by changes in other commodity costs and other factors, may impact our results of operations and financial position by increasing the amount we pay to purchase power to supply PLR obligations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Electricity and fuel prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time for a variety of reasons, including: changing weather conditions or seasonality; changes in electricity usage by our customers; liquidity in wholesale power and other markets; transmission congestion or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies; availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources; changes in supply and demand for energy commodities; changes in power production capacity; outages at our power production facilities or those of our competitors; changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil and refined products; and natural disasters, wars, acts of sabatage, terrorist acts, embargeos and other catastrophic events. We Are Exposed to Operational, Price and Credit Risks Associated With Selling and Marketing Products in the Power Markets That We Do Not Always Completely Hedge Against We purchase and sell power at the wholesale level under market based tariffs authorized by the FERC, and also enter into short term agreements to sell available energy and capacity from our generation assets. If we are unable to deliver firm capacity and energy under these agreements, we may be required to pay damages. These damages would generally be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement capacity or energy and the contract price of the undelivered capacity or energy. Depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant. Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, and other factors could affect our ability to meet our obligations, or cause increases in the market price of replacement capacity and energy. 23 We attempt to mitigate risks associated with satisfying our contractual power sales arrangements by reserving generation capacity to deliver electricity to satisfy our net firm sales contracts and, when necessary, by purchasing firm transmission service. We also routinely enter into contracts, such as fuel and power purchase and sale commitments, to hedge our exposure to fuel requirements and other energy related commodities. We may not, however, hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected. Our Risk Management Policies Relating to Energy and Fuel Prices, and Counterparty Credit are by Their Very Nature Risk Related, and We Could Suffer Economic Losses Despite Such Policies We attempt to manage the market risk inherent in our energy and fuel and debt positions. Procedures have been implemented to enhance and monitor compliance with our risk management policies, including validation of transaction and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, sensitivity analysis and daily portfolio reporting of various risk measurement metrics. Nonetheless, we cannot economically hedge against all of our exposures in these areas and our risk management program may not operate as planned. For instance, actual electricity and fuel prices may be significantly different or more volatile than the historical trends and assumptions upon which we based our risk management positions. Also, our power plants might not produce the expected amount of power during a given day or time period due to weather conditions, technical problems or other unanticipated events, which could require us to make energy purchases at higher prices than the prices under our energy supply contracts. In addition, the amount of fuel required for our power plants during a given day or time period could be more than expected, which could require us to buy additional fuel at prices less favorable than the prices under our fuel contracts. As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions were intended to hedge. We also face credit risks that parties with whom we contract could default in their performance, in which cases we could be forced to sell our power into a lower priced market or make purchases in a higher priced market than existed at the time of contract. Although we have established risk management policies and programs, including credit policies to evaluate counterparty credit risk, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully meet our obligations, that we will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform or that we will not experience counterparty non performance or that we will collect for voided contracts. If counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then current market prices. In that event, our financial results would likely be adversely affected. Nuclear Generation Involves Risks that Include Uncertainties Relating to Health and Safety, Additional Capital Costs, the Adequacy of Insurance Coverage and Nuclear Plant Decommissioning FirstEnergy is subject to the risks of nuclear generation, including but not limited to the following: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from certain unplanned radiological releases associated with the operation of our nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with our nuclear operations or those of others in the United States; uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed operation. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing security and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and or shut down a unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants, including ours. FirstEnergys nuclear facilities are insured under NEIL policies issued for each plant. Under these policies, up to $2.75 billion of insurance coverage is provided for property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs. We have also obtained approximately $2.0 billion of insurance coverage for replacement power costs. Under these policies, we can be assessed a maximum of approximately $72 million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year that are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for paying losses. 24 The Price Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear power plant to $10.8 billion (assuming 104 units licensed to operate in the United States) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: (i) private insurance amounting to $300.0 million; and (ii) $10.5 billion provided by an industry retrospective rating plan. Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess of private insurance, up to $100.6 million (but not more than $15.0 million per year) must be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident. Based on our present nuclear ownership, the maximum potential assessment under these provisions would be $402.4 million per incident but not more than $60.0 million in any one year. We Rely on Transmission and Distribution Assets that we do not Own or Control to Deliver Our Wholesale Electricity. If Transmission is Disrupted Including Our Own Transmission, or not Operated Efficiently, or if Capacity is Inadequate, Our Ability to Sell and Deliver Power may be Hindered. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity we sell. If transmission is disrupted (as a result of weather, natural disasters or other reasons) or not operated efficiently by ISOs, in applicable markets, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered, or we may be unable to sell products on the most favorable terms. Demand for electricity within our service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailing of electricity usage with consequent effects on operating costs, revenues and results of operations. In addition, as with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity could result in MISO, PJM or the FERC requiring us to upgrade or expand our transmission system through additional capital expenditures. The FERC has issued regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open access, non discriminatory basis. Although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity, there is the potential that fair and equal access to transmission systems will not be available or that sufficient transmission capacity will not be available to transmit electricity as we desire. We cannot predict the timing of industry changes as a result of these initiatives or the adequacy of transmission facilities in specific markets or whether ISOs in applicable markets will operate the transmission networks, and provide related services, efficiently. Disruptions in Our Fuel Supplies Could Occur, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Operate Our Generation Facilities We purchase fuel from a number of suppliers. The lack of availability of fuel, or a disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of weather, increased transportation costs or other difficulties, labor relations or environmental or other regulations affecting our fuel suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, which could result in lower sales and or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. Seasonal Temperature Variations, as well as Weather Conditions or other Natural Disasters Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results of Operations Specifically with Respect to Our PLR Contracts that do not Provide for a Specific Level of Supply, and Demand Significantly Below or Above our Forecasts Could Adversely Affect our Energy Margins Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electric power. In our service areas, demand for power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, ice or snow storms or droughts or other natural disasters, may cause outages and property damage that may require us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned under these conditions would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period. Demand that we satisfy pursuant to our PLR contracts could increase as a result of severe weather conditions, economic development or other reasons over which we have no control. We satisfy our electricity supply obligations through a portfolio approach of providing electricity from our generation assets, contractual relationships and market purchases. A significant increase in demand would adversely affect our energy margins because we are required under the terms of the PLR contracts to provide the energy supply to fulfill this increased demand at capped rates, which we expect to remain significantly below the wholesale prices at which we would have to purchase the additional supply if needed or, if we had available capacity, the prices at which we could otherwise sell the additional supply. Accordingly, any significant change in demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 25 We Are Subject to Financial Performance Risks Related to the Economic Cycles of the Electric Utility Industry Our business follows the economic cycles of our customers. Sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affects the markets in which we operate and negatively influences our energy operations. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns will reduce overall electricity sales and lessen our cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production, resulting in less consumption of electricity. Economic conditions also impact the rate of delinquent customer accounts receivable. The Goodwill of One or More of Our Operating Subsidiaries May Become Impaired, Which Would Result in Write Offs of the Impaired Amounts There is a possibility that additional goodwill may be impaired at one or more of our operating subsidiaries. The actual timing and amounts of any goodwill impairments in future years would depend on many uncertain variables, including changing interest rates, utility sector market performance, our capital structure, market prices for power, results of future rate proceedings, operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors. We Face Certain Human Resource Risks Associated with the Availability of Trained and Qualified Labor to Meet Our Future Staffing Requirements Workforce demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is significantly higher than the national average. Today, nearly one half of the industrys workforce is age 45 or older. Consequently, we face the difficult challenge of finding ways to retain our aging skilled workforce while recruiting new talent to mitigate losses in critical knowledge and skills due to retirements. Mitigating these risks could require additional financial commitments. Significant Increases in Our Operation and Maintenance Expenses, Including Our Health Care and Pension Costs, Could Adversely Affect Our Future Earnings and Liquidity We continually focus on limiting, and reducing where possible, our operation and maintenance expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures, including health care and pension costs. We have experienced significant health care cost inflation in the last few years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to continue to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, many of which relate to factors beyond our control. These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our costs could be significantly increased. Acts of War or Terrorism Could Negatively Impact Our Business The possibility that our infrastructure, or that of an interconnected company, such as electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of war or terrorism could affect our operations. Our generation plants, transmission and distribution facilities, or those of interconnected companies, may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in disruption of our ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity. Any such disruption could result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to purchase electricity and to replace or repair our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Associated With Regulation Complex and Changing Government Regulations Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Results of Operations We are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence our operating environment. Changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations could require us to incur additional costs or change the way we conduct our business, and therefore could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 26 Regulatory Changes in the Electric Industry Including a Reversal, Discontinuance or Delay of the Present Trend Towards Competitive Markets Could Affect Our Competitive Position and Result in Unrecoverable Costs Adversely Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations As a result of the actions taken by state legislative bodies over the last few years, changes in the electric utility business have occurred and are continuing to take place throughout the United States, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These changes have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in fundamental alterations in the way integrated utilities conduct their business. Some deregulated electricity markets have experienced difficulty in transition to market. In some of these markets, both state and federal government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to delay market restructuring or even re regulate areas of these markets that have previously been deregulated. For example, in 2001, the FERC instituted a series of price controls designed to mitigate (or cap) prices in the entire western U.S. to address the extreme volatility in the California electricity markets. These price controls have had the effect of significantly reducing spot and forward electricity prices in the western market. In addition, the ISOs that oversee the transmission systems in certain wholesale electricity markets have from time to time been authorized to impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. Similar types of price limitations and other mechanisms could reduce the profits that our wholesale power marketing business would have realized based on competitive market conditions absent such limitations and mechanisms. Although we expect the deregulated electricity markets to continue to be competitive, other proposals to re regulate our industry may be made, and legislative or other action affecting the electric power restructuring process may cause the process to be delayed, discontinued or reversed in the states in which we currently, or may in the future, operate. Such delays, discontinuations or reversals of electricity market restructurings in the markets in which we operate could have an impact on our results of operations and financial condition. At a minimum, these types of actions raise uncertainty concerning the continued development of competitive power markets. The FERC and the U.S. Congress propose changes from time to time in the structure and conduct of the electric utility industry. If the restructuring and deregulation efforts result in increased competition or unrecoverable costs, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot predict the extent or timing of further efforts to restructure, deregulate or re regulate our business or the industry. Our Profitability is Impacted by Our Affiliated Companies Continued Authorization to Sell Power at Market Based Rates In 2005 the FERC granted FES, FGCO and NGC authority to sell electricity at market based rates. The FERCs orders that grant this market based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. As a condition to the orders granting these generating companies market based rate authority, every three years they are required to file a market power update to show that they continue to meet the FERCs standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for market based rates. They will be required to renew this authority in 2008. If any of these companies were to lose its market based rate authority or fail to have such authority renewed, it would be required to obtain the FERCs acceptance to sell power at cost based rates. That company then would become subject to the accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost based rate schedules. The FERC has issued a proposed rulemaking to revise the standards used to determine whether an applicant qualifies for market based authority. In addition, the FERC is considering modifications to other aspects of its market based rate authorizations, including whether to continue granting waivers of FERCs accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost based rates, whether to continue granting blanket approval for future securities issuances or assumptions of liabilities to entities with market based rate authority, whether to adopt a uniform tariff that applies to all market based rate sellers, and whether to modify the approach to the three year market power update filing. The FERC has solicited comments from interested parties on these and other issues. The outcome of this proposed rulemaking proceeding could affect the regulatory requirements applicable to FES, FGCO, and NGC as market based rate sellers. The Amount We Charge Third Parties for Using Our Transmission Facilities May be Reduced and not Recovered. In July 2003, the FERC issued an order directing PJM and the MISO to make compliance filings to eliminate the transaction based charges for RTOR transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within the proposed MISO and PJM expanded regions (Combined Footprint). The elimination of the T&O rates reduces the transmission service revenues collected by the RTOs and thereby reduces the revenues received by transmission owners under the RTOs revenue distribution protocols. To mitigate the impact of lost RTOR revenues, the FERC approved SECA transition rates beginning in December 2004 and extending through March 2006. 27 A hearing in the SECA case was held in May 2006 to determine whether any of the SECA revenues should be refunded. In August 2006, the ALJ issued an initial decision, finding that the rate design for the recovery of SECA charges was flawed and that a large portion of the "lost revenues" reflected in the SECA rates were not recoverable. The ALJ found that the SECA rates charged were unfair, unjust and discriminatory, and that new compliance filings and refunds should be made. The ALJ also found that unpaid SECA rates must be paid in the recommended reduced amount. Although we believe we have meritorious arguments, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any future FERC proceedings or court appeals. If the FERC adopts the ALJs decision, it could have an impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. Also, management is unable to predict whether the FERC will approve either the ALJs decision or when, or if, the effect of the loss of RTOR/SECA transmission revenues will be recoverable in the state retail jurisdictions and or from transmission users within the PJM region. Therefore, the final amount of our SECA obligations, if any, remains uncertain. There Are Uncertainties Relating to Our Participation in the PJM and MISO Regional Transmission Organizations Market rules that govern the operation of RTOs could affect our ability to sell power produced by our generating facilities to users in certain markets due to transmission constraints and attendant congestion costs. The prices in day ahead and real time RTO markets have been subject to price volatility. Administrative costs imposed by RTOs, including the cost of administering energy markets, have also increased. The rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues. We are incurring significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, and may be limited by state retail rate caps with respect to the price at which power can be sold to retail customers. While RTO rates for transmission service are designed to be revenue neutral, our revenues from customers to whom we currently provide transmission services may not reflect all of the administrative and market related costs imposed under the RTO tariff due to state retail rate caps. In addition, we may be required to expand our transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than our internal planning process. Because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets, or how RTOs will ultimately develop and operate or what region they will cover, we cannot fully assess the impact that these power markets or other ongoing RTO developments may have. Costs of Compliance with Environmental Laws are Significant, and the Cost of Compliance with Future Environmental Laws Could Adversely Affect Cash Flow and Profitability Certain of our subsidiaries operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to incur costs toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, maintenance, upgrading, remediation and permitting at all of our facilities. These expenditures have been significant in the past and may increase in the future. If the cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations does increase, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Moreover, changes in environmental laws or regulations may materially increase our costs of compliance or accelerate the timing of capital expenditures. Because of the deregulation of generation, we may not directly recover through rates additional costs incurred for such compliance. Our compliance strategy, although reasonably based on available information, may not successfully address future relevant standards and interpretations. If FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control or new interpretations of longstanding requirements, that failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal liability and fines. In addition, any alleged violation of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations. Also, we are generally responsible for on site liabilities, and in some cases off site liabilities, associated with the environmental condition of our facilities which we have acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with some acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against some environmental liabilities. If we incur a material liability, or the other party to a transaction fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us, we could suffer material losses. The EPAs final CAIR, CAMR and CAVR require significant reductions beginning in 2009 in air emissions from coal fired power plants and the states have been given substantial discretion in developing their own rules to implement these programs. In addition, both the CAIR and the CAMR have been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. As a result, the ultimate requirements under these air emission reduction programs may not be known for several years and may differ significantly from the current rules. If the final rules are remanded by the Court of Appeals, if states elect not to participate in the various federal programs under the rules, or if the states elect to impose additional requirements on individual units that are already subject to the CAIR, the CAMR and or the CAVR, costs of compliance could increase significantly and could have an adverse effect on future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Alternatively, if the final rules are remanded by the Court and their implementation is postponed, we could be competitively disadvantaged because we are currently obligated to comply with essentially this same level of emission controls as a result of our settlement of the New Source Review Litigation related to our W. H. Sammis Plant. 28 There also is growing concern nationally and internationally about global warming. Further, many states and environmental groups have also challenged certain of the federal laws and regulations relating to air emissions as not being sufficiently strict. As a result, it is possible that state and federal regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent limitations on emissions than are currently in effect. Any such additional limitations on emissions may require us to make increased expenditures for pollution control devices which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergys plants. In addition, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards applicable to FirstEnergys operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act, authority to grant federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System water discharge permits can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such authority. We are and may Become Subject to Legal Claims Arising from the Presence of Asbestos or Other Regulated Substances at Some of our Facilities We have been named as a defendant in pending asbestos litigation involving multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants. In addition, asbestos and other regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at our facilities where suitable alternative materials are not available. We believe that any remaining asbestos at our facilities is contained. The continued presence of asbestos and other regulated substances at these facilities, however, could result in additional actions being brought against us. The Continuing Availability and Operation of Generating Units is Dependent on Retaining the Necessary Licenses, Permits, and Operating Authority from Governmental Entities, Including the NRC We are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate our business. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on operating results from future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and we are not assured that any such permits, approvals or certifications will be renewed. We May Ultimately Incur Liability in Connection with Federal Proceedings On October 20, 2004, FirstEnergy was notified by the SEC that the previously disclosed informal inquiry initiated by the SECs Division of Enforcement in September 2003 relating to the restatements in August 2003 of previously reported results by FirstEnergy and the Ohio Companies, and the Davis Besse extended outage, have become the subject of a formal order of investigation. The SECs formal order of investigation also encompasses issues raised during the SECs examination of FirstEnergy and the Companies under the PUHCA. Concurrent with this notification, FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for background documents and documents related to the restatements and Davis Besse issues. On December 30, 2004, FirstEnergy received a subpoena asking for documents relating to issues raised during the SECs PUHCA examination. On August 24, 2005, additional information was requested regarding Davis Besse. FirstEnergy has cooperated fully with the informal inquiry and will continue to do so with the formal investigation. Risks Associated With Financing and Capital Structure Interest Rates and or a Credit Ratings Downgrade Could Negatively Affect Our Financing Costs and Our Ability to Access Capital We have near term exposure to interest rates from outstanding indebtedness indexed to variable interest rates, and we have exposure to future interest rates to the extent we seek to raise debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations and fund construction or other investment opportunities. Interest rates could change in significant ways as a result of economic or other events that our risk management processes were not established to address. As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have on us if actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions were intended to hedge. Although we employ risk management techniques to hedge against interest rate volatility, significant and sustained increases in market interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively impact our reported results. 29 We rely on access to bank and capital markets as sources of liquidity for cash requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. A downgrade in our credit ratings from the nationally recognized credit rating agencies, particularly to a level below investment grade, could negatively affect our ability to access the bank and capital markets, especially in a time of uncertainty in either of those markets, and may require us to post cash collateral to support outstanding commodity positions in the wholesale market, as well as in place of letters of credit and other guarantees. A ratings downgrade would also increase the fees we pay on our various credit facilities, thus increasing the cost of our working capital. A ratings downgrade could also impact our ability to grow our businesses by substantially increasing the cost of, or limiting access to, capital. Our senior unsecured debt ratings from S&P, Moodys, and Fitch are investment grade. The current ratings outlook from S&P is stable and the ratings outlook from Moodys is positive. Fitchs ratings outlook is positive for CEI and TE and stable for all other subsidiaries and FirstEnergy. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold debt, inasmuch as such rating does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor. The ratings assigned to our debt address the likelihood of payment of principal and interest pursuant to their terms. A rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating that may be assigned to our securities. We Must Rely on Cash from Our Subsidiaries We are a holding company and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all of our business is conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow is dependent on the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their ability to upstream cash to the holding company. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions that generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers are being met. Those state commissions could attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of our utility subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise restrict cash payments to us. We Cannot Assure Common Shareholders that Future Dividend Payments Will be Made, or if Made, in What Amounts they May be Paid Our Board of Directors regularly evaluates our common stock dividend policy and determines the dividend rate each quarter. The level of dividends will continue to be influenced by many factors, including, among other things, our earnings, financial condition and cash flows from subsidiaries, as well as general economic and competitive conditions. We cannot assure common shareholders that dividends will be paid in the future, or that, if paid, dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past. ITEM 1B.
