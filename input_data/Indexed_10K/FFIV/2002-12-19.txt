Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and Notes. Year Ended September 30 2002 2001 2000 Revenues (in thousands) Net revenues Products $ 82,566 $ 78,628 $ 87,980 Services 25,700 28,739 20,665 Total $ 108,266 $ 107,367 $ 108,645 Percentage of net revenues Products 76.3 % 73.2 % 81.0 % Services 23.7 26.8 19.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net revenues. Total net revenues increased 1.0% in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001, compared to a decrease of 1.0% in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000. The increase in fiscal 2002 was due to higher product sales resulting from a modest recovery in demand for our products. The increased product sales were partially offset by a decrease in service revenues resulting from changes in pricing and a higher percentage of our channel partners providing maintenance and installation services to end users. The decrease in fiscal 2001 revenues, compared to fiscal 2000, was primarily due to lower product sales as a result of a downturn in the US economy in fiscal 2001. International revenues represented 32%, 33% and 19% of total sales in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to lower sales in Japan during fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2001 was the first complete year for which we had subsidiaries in the Asia Pacific region that contributed to the increase in our international sales as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2000. We expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international sales as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels. Sales of our BIG IP products represented 64%, 64%, and 62% of total net revenues in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of BIG IP in the future. During fiscal 2002 and 2001 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10% of net revenue or our accounts receivable balance. During fiscal 2000, one of our resellers, Exodus Communications, accounted for 14% of net revenue and 8% of our accounts receivable balance. Product revenues. Product revenues were $82.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 compared to $78.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2001, and $88.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. The 5.0% increase in fiscal year 2002 was primarily the result of strong sales in North America, partially offset by decreased sales in Japan. The 10.6% decrease in fiscal year 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, was primarily the result of reduced demand for our products in the US due to a general slow down in the US economy. Service revenues. Service revenues were $25.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 compared to $28.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, and $20.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Service revenue decreased by 10.6% in fiscal year 2002 primarily due to changes in pricing and a larger percentage of our resellers providing maintenance and installation to end users, partially offset by an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers. The 39.1% increase in service revenues in fiscal year 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, was primarily due to an increase in the installed base of our products and the renewal of service and support contracts. 14 Year Ended September 30 2002 2001 2000 Gross margin (in thousands) Cost of net revenues Products $ 20,241 $ 33,240 $ 24,660 Services 10,238 12,265 7,911 Total 30,479 45,505 32,571 Gross margin $ 77,787 $ 61,862 $ 76,074 Cost of net revenues (as a percentage of related revenue) Products 24.5 % 42.3 % 28.0 % Services 39.8 42.7 38.3 Total 28.2 42.4 30.0 Gross margin 71.8 % 57.6 % 70.0 % Cost of product revenues. Cost of product revenues decreased 39.1% to $20.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2002 from $33.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2001. The cost of product revenues for fiscal 2000 totaled $24.7 million. Cost of product revenues decreased as a percent of net product revenue to 24.5% for fiscal year 2002 from 42.3% for fiscal year 2001 and 28.0% for fiscal year 2000. The decrease in fiscal 2002 was primarily the result of lower excess inventory charges and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by increased warranty costs. Further, in fiscal 2002, we unified our supply chain with a single contract manufacturer and as result have improved our manufacturing efficiencies as well as realized lower component costs. The increase in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, was primarily the result of costs associated with product platform changes and $4.9 million of charges related to excess inventory and purchase commitments. Cost of service revenues. Cost of service revenues decreased to $10.2 million for fiscal 2002 from $12.3 million for fiscal 2001. The cost of service revenues for fiscal 2000 totaled $7.9 million. Cost of service revenues decreased as a percent of net service revenues to 39.8% for fiscal year 2002 from 42.7% for fiscal year 2001. The decrease in fiscal 2002 relates primarily to improved operational efficiencies and a decrease in headcount and related costs. Cost of service revenues increased to 42.7% in fiscal 2001 compared to 38.3% for fiscal year 2000. The increase in cost of service revenue in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, is due to an increase in customer base and an increase in personnel and the related costs. Year Ended September 30 2002 2001 2000 Operating expenses (in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 50,581 $ 50,767 $ 36,890 Research and development 17,985 17,435 14,478 General and administrative 15,045 18,776 9,727 Restructuring Charges 3,274 975 Amortization of unearned compensation 443 2,625 2,127 Total $ 87,328 $ 90,578 $ 63,222 Operating expenses (as a percentage of revenue) Sales and marketing 46.7 % 47.3 % 34.0 % Research and development 16.6 16.2 13.3 General and administrative 13.9 17.5 9.0 Restructuring Charges 3.0 0.9 Amortization of unearned compensation 0.4 2.4 2.0 Total 80.7 % 84.4 % 58.2 % 15 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased less than 1.0% to $50.6 million in fiscal 2002 from $50.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in fiscal 2002 relates primarily to lower trade show and promotional activities and decreased business travel expenses partially offset by increased personnel costs as we continued to expand our international operations. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $50.8 million in fiscal 2001 from $36.9 million in fiscal year 2000. The increase in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, was due to an increase in headcount and related costs, and increased advertising and promotional activities. We expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in order to grow net revenues and expand our brand awareness. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses. Research and development expenses increased 3.2% to $18.0 million in fiscal 2002, from $17.4 million in fiscal 2001 and $14.5 million in fiscal year 2000. The increase in fiscal 2002 relates primarily to increased personnel related costs and expenses related to the development of new products. The increase in fiscal year 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, relates primarily to personnel related costs and an increase in facilities costs related to the Spokane office. We expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new, technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and related costs of our executive, finance, information technology, human resource and legal personnel, third party professional service fees, bad debt charges and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 19.9% to $15.0 million in fiscal 2002 from $18.8 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in fiscal 2002 is primarily due to lower bad debt charges and lower facilities expenses resulting from the sublease of one of our buildings, partially offset by an increase in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property. General and administrative expenses increased to $18.8 million in fiscal 2001 from $9.7 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in fiscal 2001, compared to fiscal 2000, related primarily to an increase in bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy filing by Exodus Communications and an increase in headcount and other payroll related costs. Restructuring charges. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of $2.8 million in connection with managements decision to exit the cache appliance business. As a result of changes in the business, we wrote down certain assets, consolidated operations and terminated 47 employees throughout all divisions of the Company. In July 2002, all identified employees had been notified and terminated resulting in an additional charge of $503,000 related to employee separation costs. Amortization of unearned compensation. We have recorded a total of $8.3 million of stock compensation costs since our inception through September 30, 2002. These charges represent the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors. These options generally vest ratably over a four year period. We are amortizing these costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by FASB interpretation No. 28 (FIN No. 28) and recorded stock compensation charges of $0.4 million, $2.6 million, and $2.1 million for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 16 Year Ended September 30 2002 2001 2000 Other Income and Income Taxes (in thousands) Income (loss) from operations $ (9,541 ) $ (28,716 ) $ 12,852 Other income, net 1,420 2,021 2,903 Income (loss) before income taxes (8,121 ) (26,695 ) 15,755 Provision for income taxes 489 4,095 2,105 Net income (loss) $ (8,610 ) $ (30,790 ) $ 13,650 Income (loss) from operations (as a percentage of revenue) (8.8 )% (26.7 )% 11.8 % Other income, net 1.3 1.9 2.7 Income (loss) before income taxes (7.5 ) (24.9 ) 14.5 Provision for income taxes 0.5 3.8 1.9 Net income (loss) (8.0 )% (28.7 )% 12.6 % Other income, net. Other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net, decreased 29.7% to $1.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $2.0 million in fiscal 2001 and $2.9 million in fiscal 2000. This decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates and investment income. Provision for income taxes. The income tax provision of $489,000 reported in fiscal 2002 is due to foreign income taxes related to our international operations. The income tax provision increased to $4.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in the provision for income taxes was caused by our decision to provide for a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2001. Year Ended September 30 2002 2001 2000 Liquidity and Capital Resources (in thousands) Working capital $ 74,510 $ 74,890 $ 66,318 Cash and cash equivalents 20,801 18,321 18,536 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 9,505 (11,833 ) 9,848 Cash used in investing activities (12,663 ) (24,709 ) (43,709 ) Cash provided by financing activities 5,483 36,343 35,084 From our inception through May 1999, we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of approximately $12.4 million in equity securities. In June 1999, we completed an initial public offering of 2,860,000 shares of common stock and raised approximately $25.5 million, net of offering costs. In October 1999, we completed a secondary public offering of 500,000 shares of common stock and raised approximately $31.4 million, net of offering costs. On June 26, 2001, we entered into a Common Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Nokia Finance International B.V. (NFI). Under this agreement, we issued and sold to NFI (i) 2,466,421 shares of common stock and (ii) warrants (the Warrants) to purchase additional shares of common stock. We received total proceeds of $34.9 million, net of $1.75 million of issuance costs from the sale of these shares and the Warrants. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2002 was $9.5 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $11.8 million in fiscal 2001 and cash provided by operating activities of $9.8 million in fiscal 2000. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from changes in operating assets and liabilities, as adjusted for various non cash changes including restructuring charges, provision for asset write downs, provision for doubtful accounts, and depreciation and amortization. Cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2001 resulted primarily from operating losses, partially offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000 resulted from increases in accounts receivable due to increased sales and other current assets, which were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenues. 17 Cash used in investing activities was $12.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2002, $24.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2001, and $43.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2000. Cash used in each of the fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000 were due primarily to the purchase of investments and property and equipment, partially offset by the sale of investments. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2002 was $5.5 million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $36.3 million in the prior year. In 2002, our financing activities primarily related to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common shares under our employee stock purchase plan. In 2001, we also received $34.9 million related to the issuance of common stock to Nokia, in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. We expect that our existing cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2002, our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases. In April 2000, we entered into a lease agreement on two buildings for our corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in July 2000 on the first building; and the lease on the second building commenced in October 2000. The lease for both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for renewal. The lease for the second building has been fully subleased through 2012. We established a restricted escrow account in connection with this lease agreement. Under the term of the lease, a $6.0 million certificate of deposit is required through November 2012, unless the lease is terminated before then. This amount has been included on our balance sheet as a component of restricted cash. Contractual obligations reflected in the following table are net of anticipated sublease income. Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Less than 1 3 4 5 After 5 Obligations Total 1 year Years Years Years Net operating leases $ 20,840 $ 2,755 $ 4,596 $ 4,238 $ 9,251 Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, SEC Staff Accounting Bulleting (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions. We sell products through resellers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and other channel partners, as well as directly to end users, under similar terms. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. Product revenues from OEM agreements are recognized based on reporting of sales from the OEM partner. Typically a software license, hardware, installation and post contract customer support (PCS) elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price. A portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. Revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a 18 straight line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, a limited period of telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customers site. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out of pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed. Our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net 30 days. Our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets. We have offered extended payment terms beyond ordinary terms to some customers. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized when payments become due. Reserve for Doubtful Accounts. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience, current trends, credit policy, specific identification and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write offs of our receivables, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require any collateral. If there is a deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected. Reserve for Product Returns. Sales returns are estimated based on historical experience by type of product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. In some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns, inventory in the distribution channel, and other related factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could seriously harm our business. Reserve for Obsolete/ Excess Inventory. We currently reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Reserve for Warranties. Our warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. FASB 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from acquisition, construction or development, and (or) the normal operation of a long lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for 19 the disposal of a segment of a business. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a material impact on our financial statements. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business. Our success depends on sales of our BIG IP We currently derive approximately 64% of our net revenues from sales of our BIG IP product line. In addition, we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of BIG IP in the future. Implementation of our strategy depends upon BIG IP being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers. If BIG IP is unable to solve these problems for our customers, our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed. Our success depends on our timely development of new products and features We expect the Internet traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes, and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers. If we are unable to identify, develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed. We may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging Internet traffic market Our markets are new, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future. Our principal competitors in the Internet traffic market include Cisco Systems, Foundry Networks, Nortel Networks and RadWare. We expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the Internet traffic management market. In addition, larger companies with significant resources, brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing Internet traffic management solutions and emerge as significant competitors. Potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an Internet traffic management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products. Our quarterly operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate Our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. In particular, we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period. In the past, a significant portion of our sales has been realized near the end of a quarter. Accordingly, a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter. Furthermore, we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed. Consequently, if revenue levels fall below our expectations, our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues. We believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Our operating results may be below the expectations of 20 securities analysts and investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations will likely seriously harm the market price of our common stock. The average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase, which may negatively impact gross profits We anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts, new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors. Therefore, in order to maintain our gross profits, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs. Our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline, which will seriously harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. It is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle Our products have a lengthy sales cycle, which is difficult to predict. Historically, our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months. Sales of BIG IP and 3 DNS require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits. The sale of our products is subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require. For example, customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase. Customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us. As a result, our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results. We may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships Our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the United States and internationally through leading industry resellers, original equipment manufacturers, systems integrators, Internet service providers and other channel partners. We have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels, and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships. During fiscal 2002 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10% of net revenue or our accounts receivable balance. If we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels, our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed. Our expansion into international markets may not succeed We intend to continue expanding into international markets. International sales represented 32% of our net revenues for the year ended September 30, 2002, 33% of our net revenues for the year ended September 30, 2001 and 19% of our net revenues for the year ended September 30, 2000. We have engaged sales personnel in Australia, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in selected countries in the European and Asia Pacific markets. If we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed. Such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate, and we may not be able to successfully market, sell, deliver and support our products internationally. Our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce As our international sales increase, our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks. These risks include risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, managing foreign sales offices, regulatory, political, or economic conditions in specific countries, changes in laws and tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries, foreign regulatory requirements, and natural disasters. All of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. 21 Our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract, train and retain qualified marketing and sales, professional services and customer support personnel Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, product development, sales, marketing and finance personnel, many of who may be difficult to replace. The complexity of our Internet traffic and content management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support, as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort, requires us to retain highly trained professional services, customer support and sales personnel. In spite of the economic downturn, competition for qualified professional services, customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in our stock price, since these employees are generally granted stock options. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, may seriously harm our business and results of operations. Our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products We rely on third party contract manufacturers to assemble our products. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to a contract manufacturer who assembles these hardware platforms to our specifications. We have experienced minor delays in shipments from our contract manufacturers in the past, which have not had a material impact on our results of operations. We may experience delays in the future or other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product, any of which may seriously harm our business and results of operations. The inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may seriously harm our business and results of operations. If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase our material purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions. Any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue, may seriously harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers. Our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources We currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from limited sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components, or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, will seriously harm our business and results of operations. Undetected software errors may seriously harm our business and results of operations Software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors. While we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. A material product liability claim may seriously harm our business and results of operations. Our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The occurrence of software errors, whether caused by our products or another vendors products, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. The occurrence of any of these problems may seriously harm our business and results of operations. 22 We may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights claims or initiate litigation against us or our contract manufacturers, suppliers or customers with respect to existing or future products. Our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technology, which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers. We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors. Any of these claims, with or without merit, may be time consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business and results of operations may be seriously harmed.

The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, they may become significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date, however we may do so in the future. 24
