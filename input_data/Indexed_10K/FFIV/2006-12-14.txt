Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements In our Annual Report on Form 10 K/A No. 2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 (filed on December 12, 2006), we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the selected consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q/A for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006, each of which was filed on December 13, 2006. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflects our restatement. Overview We are a global provider of software and hardware products and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage their Internet traffic. Our products enhance the delivery, optimization and security of application traffic on Internet based networks. We market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan and the Asia Pacific region. Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in financial services, transportation, government and telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base. Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those indicators include: Revenues. The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our core products; BIG IP Local Traffic Manager; BIG IP Global Traffic Manager; BIG IP ISP Traffic Manager; TrafficShield Application Firewall, and FirePass SSL VPN servers. We also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts, installation, training and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends. Cost of revenues and gross margins. We strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third party software license fees, and amortization of developed technology, personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained relatively stable over the past two years; however factors such as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases, and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent the significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis. 26 Table of Contents Operating expenses. Operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Liquidity and cash flows. Our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments during the fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to net income from operations, with operating activities providing cash of $125.4 million. Capital expenditures during the fiscal year 2006 were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities. Balance sheet. We view cash, short term and long term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was 51. We expect to maintain this metric going forward. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user. In this situation, we receive a sales report from the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user has occurred. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international customers range from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when payments are made. Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and post contract customer support (PCS) elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. Revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when and if 27 Table of Contents available, a limited period of telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customers site. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out of pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed. Reserve for Doubtful Accounts. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there is deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient. Reserve for Product Returns. In some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates. Reserve for Warranties. A warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. Accounting for Income Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Accordingly, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Stock based compensation. We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), on July 1, 2005. Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123). In accordance with APB 25, no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. We adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year 2005 includes: a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. The results for the prior periods have not been restated. Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the straight line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense. Previously under the disclosure only provisions of SFAS 123, the Company used the accelerated method of expense recognition pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans (FIN 28). For all unvested options outstanding as of 28 Table of Contents July 1, 2005, the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period. For share based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of grant, will be recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. In addition, in 2005, we modified the method in which we issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation. In prior years, stock based compensation consisted only of stock options. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we began to grant restricted stock unit awards instead of stock options. The value of restricted stock units is determined using the intrinsic value method, which in this case, is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining the fair value of stock options, we use the Black Scholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions. Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price, over the expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve managements best estimates at that time, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option. SFAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. Our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 is 5%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands, except for percentages) Net Revenues Products $ 304,878 $ 219,603 $ 126,169 Services 89,171 61,807 45,021 Total $ 394,049 $ 281,410 $ 171,190 Percentage of net revenues Products 77.4 % 78.0 % 73.7 % Services 22.6 22.0 26.3 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net Revenues. Total net revenues increased 40.0% in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005, compared to an increase of 64.4% in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004. The continued revenue growth was due to increased demand for our Application Traffic Management (ATM) products and higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of products. During fiscal year 2006, each of our primary geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period. International revenues represented 42.6%, 40.5% and 39.4% of net revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels. Net product revenues increased 38.8% in fiscal year 2006 and 74.1% in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our BIG IP product line as well as incremental revenues derived from sales of our TrafficShield and WAN Optimization product lines. Sales of our BIG IP family of application delivery 29 Table of Contents networking products represented 89.4%, 89.1% and 90.3% of total product revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net service revenues increased 44.3% in fiscal year 2006 compared to a 37.3% increase for fiscal year 2005 from the prior year, respectively. The increase of services revenues in absolute dollars was the result of increased purchases and renewals of maintenance contracts as our installed base of products increased. Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 13.6%, 18.6%, and 19.1% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. GE Access, one of our domestic distributors, which began selling our products in fiscal year 2006 accounted for 11.6% of our total net revenue in fiscal 2006. Ingram Micro accounted for 8.5%, 26.2% and 26.9% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands, except for percentages) Cost of net revenues and Gross margin Products $ 63,619 $ 48,990 $ 28,406 Services 24,534 16,194 10,993 Total 88,153 65,184 39,399 Gross margin $ 305,896 $ 216,226 $ 131,791 Cost of net revenues and Gross margin (as a percentage of related net revenue) Products 20.9 % 22.3 % 22.5 % Services 27.5 26.2 24.4 Total 22.4 23.2 23.0 Gross margin 77.6 % 76.8 % 77.0 % Cost of Net Product Revenues. Cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight, warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions. In absolute dollars, product cost increased to $63.6 million in fiscal year 2006 as compared to $49.0 million and $28.4 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increases were primarily due to the higher volume of units shipped. Higher indirect product costs including amortization charges of our acquired technology contributed to the percentage increase as compared to fiscal year 2005. Cost of Net Service Revenues. Cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff, travel, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues increased slightly to 27.5% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to 26.2% and 24.4% in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2006 is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount. Professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2006 increased to 205 from 147 at the end of fiscal year 2005. In addition, stock compensation expense increased to $1.5 million in fiscal year 2006 from $288,000 in fiscal year 2005. Going forward, we 30 Table of Contents expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base. Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands, except for percentages) Operating expenses Sales and marketing $ 127,478 $ 89,866 $ 66,446 Research and development 49,171 31,516 24,438 General and administrative 39,109 25,486 15,761 Total $ 215,758 $ 146,868 $ 106,645 Operating expenses (as a percentage of net revenue) Sales and marketing 32.4 % 31.9 % 38.8 % Research and development 12.5 11.2 14.3 General and administrative 9.9 9.1 9.2 Total 54.8 % 52.2 % 62.3 % Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. In absolute dollars, sales and marketing expense increased 41.9% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to 35.2% and 21.0% in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing is primarily due to higher commission and personnel costs, consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the corresponding period. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2006 increased to 442 from 331 at the end of fiscal 2005 and 229 at the end of fiscal 2004. Stock based compensation charges of $10.1 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2006. We expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel, prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. In absolute dollars, research and development expenses increased 56.0% in fiscal year 2006 and 29.0% in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The increases in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs attributed to an increase in headcount to 287 in fiscal year 2006 from 217 in fiscal year 2005 and 185 in fiscal 2004. The growth in employee headcount was primarily related to enhancement of our current products and the development of new advanced products. Stock based compensation charges of $6.9 million contributed to the overall increase in fiscal year 2006 compared to $1.5 million in fiscal year 2005. We expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued development of our products. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and related costs of our executive, finance, information technology, human resource and legal personnel, third party professional service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and depreciation expenses. In absolute dollars, general and administrative expenses increased 53.5% in fiscal year 2006 and increased 61.7% in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2006 is due primarily to expenses incurred by third parties for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connection with the Special Committee investigation of $7.0 million, an increase in stock based compensation charges of $5.1 million and, increased salary and benefit expenses of $2.7 million. The increase in personnel costs is consistent with the growth in headcount. General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2006 increased to 134 from 97 at the end of fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately $1.5 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses is expected 31 Table of Contents to remain at these increased levels as the Company continues to build its infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business. Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands, except for percentages) Other Income and Income Taxes Income from operations $ 90,138 $ 69,358 $ 25,146 Other income, net 17,431 8,076 2,731 Income before income taxes 107,569 77,434 27,877 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 41,564 30,532 (8,451 ) Net income $ 66,005 $ 46,902 $ 36,328 Other Income and Income Taxes (as percentage of net revenue) Income from operations 22.9 % 24.6 % 14.7 % Other income, net 4.4 2.9 1.6 Income before income taxes 27.3 27.5 16.3 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 10.5 10.8 (4.9 ) Net income 16.8 % 16.7 % 21.2 % Other Income, Net. Other income, net, consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net, increased 115.8% in fiscal year 2006 and increased 195.7% in fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The significant increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balances. The increased investment balances are the result of cash provided from operating and financing activities during the fiscal years 2005 and fiscal year 2004. Net proceeds of $113.6 million received from the sale of common stock in a public offering completed in November of 2003 was the most significant addition to our investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a 38.64% provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2006. As of fiscal year end 2006 we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $23.3 million, $40.4 million and $31.6 million, respectively. Our world wide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. We have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense. In fiscal year 2004, the primary difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was due to previously unrecognized deferred tax assets which were recognized. SFAS 109, provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization is more likely than not. Based on available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years, we had provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal year 2003. Based upon our operating performance in fiscal year 2004 and projected future taxable income, we determined that our U.S. deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realizable. Therefore, the valuation allowance was reversed and as a result we realized an income tax benefit of $11.9 million. The credit from the release of the 32 Table of Contents valuation allowance was partially offset by actual U.S. and international tax expenses resulting in a net benefit for income taxes of $8.5 million in fiscal year 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings. Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 492,176 $ 365,015 $ 222,293 Cash provided by operating activities 125,378 84,987 40,590 Cash used in investing activities (204,409 ) (126,760 ) (164,713 ) Cash provided by financing activities 65,145 68,867 138,468 Cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments totaled $492.2 million as of September 30, 2006 compared to $365.0 million as of September 30, 2005, representing an increase of $127.2 million. The increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option exercises. In fiscal year 2005, overall cash and investments increased $142.7 million compared to the fiscal year 2004. The increase was primarily due to the net proceeds of $113.6 million from the sale of 5,175,000 shares of common stock in a public offering completed in November 2003. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2006 was $125.4 million compared to $85.0 million in fiscal year 2005 and $40.6 million in fiscal year 2004. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities as adjusted for various non cash items including stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges. Cash used in investing activities was $204.4 million for the fiscal year 2006, $126.8 million for fiscal year 2005 and $164.7 million for fiscal year 2004. The cash used in fiscal year 2006 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially offset by the sale of investments and $42.8 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to shareholders of Swan Labs, which was acquired in October 2005. The cash used in the fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2004 was due to the purchase of investments, primarily made possible by the proceeds of our public offering, the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of MagniFire, partially offset by the sale of investments. Cash provided by financing activities was $65.1 million for fiscal year 2006 compared to $68.9 million and $138.5 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the fiscal years 2006 and 2005, our financing activities consisted of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. During the fiscal year 2004, our financing activities included $113.6 million of net proceeds received from a public stock offering as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. 33 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2006: Payment Obligations by Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Operating leases $ 10,934 $ 11,509 $ 12,527 $ 12,259 $ 11,032 $ 32,763 $ 91,024 Purchase obligations 10,839 10,839 Total $ 21,773 $ 11,509 $ 12,527 $ 12,259 $ 11,032 $ 32,763 $ 101,863 We lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014. Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB, issued SFAS, No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing this standard. In September 2006, the SEC issued, No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. We do not expect the adoption of SAB 108 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN, No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 109 by providing detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprises financial statements. Tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the potential effects, if any, of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less, with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.0 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2006. 34 Table of Contents Maturing in Three Months Three Months Greater Than or Less to One Year One Year Total Fair Value (In thousands, except for percentages) September 30, 2006 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 7,852 $ $ $ 7,852 $ 7,852 Weighted average interest rate 4.6 % Included in short term investments $ 122,805 $ 213,621 $ $ 336,426 $ 336,426 Weighted average interest rates 4.4 % 3.8 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 118,003 $ 118,003 $ 118,003 Weighted average interest rates 4.1 % September 30, 2005 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 298 $ $ $ 298 $ 298 Weighted average interest rate 2.5 % Included in short term investments $ 89,015 $ 95,299 $ $ 184,314 $ 184,314 Weighted average interest rates 2.6 % 2.3 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 128,834 $ 128,834 $ 128,834 Weighted average interest rates 3.1 % September 30, 2004 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 16,363 $ $ $ 16,363 $ 16,363 Weighted average interest rate 1.1 % Included in short term investments $ 64,410 $ 51,190 $ $ 115,600 $ 115,600 Weighted average interest rates 1.3 % 1.8 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 81,792 $ 81,792 $ 81,792 Weighted average interest rates 2.0 % Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future. 35 Table of Contents
