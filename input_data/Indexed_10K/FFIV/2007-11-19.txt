Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements In our Annual Report on Form 10 K/A No. 2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 (filed on December 12, 2006), we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the selected consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q/A for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006, each of which was filed on December 13, 2006. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflects our restatement. Overview We are a global provider of software and hardware products and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage their Internet traffic. Our products enhance the delivery, optimization and security of application traffic on Internet based networks. We market and sell our products primarily through indirect sales channels in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region. Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in 29 Table of Contents financial services, transportation, government and telecommunications industries continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base. Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those indicators include: Revenues. The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our core products; BIG IP Local Traffic Manager; BIG IP Global Traffic Manager; BIG IP ISP Traffic Manager; TrafficShield Application Firewall, WANJet, WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN servers; and ARX. We also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts, installation, training and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends. Cost of revenues and gross margins. We strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third party software license fees, amortization of developed technology, and personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained relatively stable over the past two years; however factors such as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases, and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent the significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis. Operating expenses. Operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Liquidity and cash flows. Our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments during the fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to net income from operations, with operating activities providing cash of $169.7 million. Going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. On September 12, 2007, we acquired all of the capital stock of Acopia Networks for cash of $210.0 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash. Balance sheet. We view cash, short term and long term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 was 57 days. We expect to maintain this metric in the mid 50 day range going forward. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, revenue is recognized upon sale to the end user. In this situation, we receive a sales report from the channel partner to determine when the sales transaction to the end user has occurred. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international customers range from net 30 to 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when payments are made. Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and post contract customer support (PCS) elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. We determine fair value based on the type of customer and region in which the package is sold. Where fair value of certain elements are not available, we recognize revenue on the residual method permitted under SOP 98 9 based on the fair value of undelivered PCS. Revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, a limited period of telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customers site. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out of pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed. Reserve for Doubtful Accounts. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there is deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient. Reserve for Product Returns. In some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates. Reserve for Warranties. A warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. Accounting for Income Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Accordingly, we are required to estimate our 31 Table of Contents income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), using the straight line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense. We recognized $41.2 million and $24.8 million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of September 30, 2007, there was $74.1 million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward, stock based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees. We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The value of RSUs is determined using the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining the fair value of stock options, we use the Black Scholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions. Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve managements best estimates at that time, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option. FAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or RSUs that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. We reduced our forfeiture rate from 5% to 4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 to better reflect our historical behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods. Compensation cost recognized for the year ended September 30, 2007 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and (b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. In August 2007, the Company granted 276,400 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on November 1, 2009. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant is subject to the Company achieving specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2008, relative to fiscal year 2007. The remaining twenty five percent is subject to the Company meeting specified performance criteria for fiscal year 2009 to be set by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. In December 2006, the Company granted 456,000 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on November 1, 2008. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant was subject to the Company achieving specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2007, relative to fiscal year 2006. This twenty five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2007. The remaining 32 Table of Contents twenty five percent is subject to the Company meeting specified performance criteria for fiscal year 2008 to be set by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. We are required to recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be acheived. We are required to reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment. Goodwill and intangible assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part, including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. In applying SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Years Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except for percentages) Net Revenues Products $ 392,921 $ 304,878 $ 219,603 Services 132,746 89,171 61,807 Total $ 525,667 $ 394,049 $ 281,410 Percentage of net revenues Products 74.7 % 77.4 % 78.0 % Services 25.3 22.6 22.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net Revenues. Total net revenues increased 33.4% in fiscal year 2007 from fiscal year 2006, compared to an increase of 40.0% in fiscal year 2006 from fiscal year 2005. The continued revenue growth was due to increased demand for our Application Traffic Management (ATM) products and higher services revenues resulting from our increased installed base of products. During fiscal year 2007, each of our primary geographic regions reported higher revenues compared to the prior year period. International revenues represented 41.6%, 42.6% and 40.5% of net revenues in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels. Net product revenues increased 28.9% in fiscal year 2007 and 38.8% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to absolute growth in the volume of product sales of our BIG IP product line as well as incremental revenues derived from sales of our 33 Table of Contents TrafficShield and WAN Optimization product lines. Sales of our BIG IP family of application delivery networking products represented 91.0%, 89.4% and 89.1% of total product revenues in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net service revenues increased 48.9% in fiscal year 2007 compared to a 44.3% increase for fiscal year 2006 from the prior year, respectively. The increase of services revenues in absolute dollars was the result of increased purchases and renewals of maintenance contracts as our installed base of products increased. Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 11.6%, 13.6%, and 18.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions, another domestic distributor accounted for 13.2% and 11.6% of our total net revenue in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions accounted for 10.6% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2007. Years Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except for percentages) Cost of net revenues and Gross margin Products $ 84,094 $ 63,619 $ 48,990 Services 34,230 24,534 16,194 Total 118,324 88,153 65,184 Gross margin $ 407,343 $ 305,896 $ 216,226 Cost of net revenues and Gross margin (as a percentage of related net revenue) Products 21.4 % 20.9 % 22.3 % Services 25.8 27.5 26.2 Total 22.5 22.4 23.2 Gross margin 77.5 % 77.6 % 76.8 % Cost of Net Product Revenues. Cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight, warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions. In absolute dollars, product cost increased to $84.1 million in fiscal year 2007 as compared to $63.6 million and $49.0 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The year over year increases were primarily due to the higher volume of units shipped compared with the prior period. Fiscal 2007 increases also include an increase in warranty expense and indirect manufacturing costs over prior periods. Fiscal 2006 increase also included an increase in indirect manufacturing cost primarily related to the amortization charges of our acquired technology. Cost of Net Service Revenues. Cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff, travel, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues remained relatively stable at 25.8% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 27.5% and 26.2% in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars year over year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount. Professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2007 increased to 279 from 205 at the end of fiscal year 2006 and 147 at the end of fiscal year 2005. In addition, stock compensation expense increased to $2.4 million in fiscal year 2007 from $1.5 million in fiscal year 2006. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base. 34 Table of Contents Years Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except for percentages) Operating expenses Sales and marketing $ 175,555 $ 127,478 $ 89,866 Research and development 69,030 49,171 31,516 General and administrative 49,256 39,109 25,486 In process research and development 14,000 Total $ 307,841 $ 215,758 $ 146,868 Operating expenses (as a percentage of net revenue) Sales and marketing 33.4 % 32.4 % 31.9 % Research and development 13.1 12.5 11.2 General and administrative 9.4 9.9 9.1 In process research and development 2.7 Total 58.6 % 54.8 % 52.2 % Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased 37.7% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 41.9% and 35.2% in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased commissions and personnel costs of $25.4 million and $21.0 million and $14.6 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively which is consistent with the increased revenue and headcount for the corresponding periods. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2007 increased to 669 from 442 at the end of fiscal 2006 and 331 at the end of fiscal 2005. Stock based compensation charges of $15.8 million, $10.1 million and $2.4 million also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in order to grow revenues and increase our market share. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel, prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Research and development expenses increased 40.4% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to 56.0% and 29.0% in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased salary and benefit expenses of $12.2 million, $8.4 million and $3.2 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively which is consistent with the increased headcount for the corresponding periods. Research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2007 increased to 450 from 287 at the end of fiscal 2006 and 217 at the end of fiscal 2005. The growth in employee headcount was primarily related to enhancement of our current products and the development of new advanced products. Stock based compensation charges of $10.2 million, $6.9 million and $1.5 million also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued development of our products. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and related costs of our executive, finance, information technology, human resource and legal personnel, third party professional service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 25.9% in fiscal year 2007 as compared with 53.5% in fiscal year 2006 and 61.7% in fiscal year 2005. The increase in fiscal year 2007 of $10.1 million was due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation charges of $6.5 million, increased salary and benefit expenses of $4.0 million and $3.1 million of other general operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses incurred by third parties for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connections with the Special Committee investigation of $4.4 million. The increase in fiscal year 2006 is due primarily to expenses incurred 35 Table of Contents by third parties for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connection with the Special Committee investigation of $7.0 million, an increase in stock based compensation charges of $5.1 million and, increased salary and benefit expenses of $2.7 million. The year over year increase in salary and benefits is consistent with the growth in headcount. General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2007 increased to 184 from 134 at the end of fiscal 2006 and 97 at the end of fiscal 2005 The increase in general and administrative expenses is expected to remain at these increased levels as the Company continues to build its infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business. In process research and development. Acquired in process research and development (IPRD) expense was $14.0 million in 2007 and reflects the amount allocated to IPRD that we acquired in the Acopia acquisition. IPRD represents the present value of estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility. We based our estimates and projections related to IPRD on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If we do not successfully develop this product, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Years Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except for percentages) Other Income and Income Taxes Income from operations $ 99,502 $ 90,138 $ 69,358 Other income, net 28,191 17,431 8,076 Income before income taxes 127,693 107,569 77,434 Provision for income taxes 50,693 41,564 30,532 Net income $ 77,000 $ 66,005 $ 46,902 Other Income and Income Taxes (as percentage of net revenue) Income from operations 18.9 % 22.9 % 24.6 % Other income, net 5.4 4.4 2.9 Income before income taxes 24.3 27.3 27.5 Provision for income taxes 9.6 10.5 10.8 Net income 14.6 % 16.8 % 16.7 % Other Income, Net. Other income, net, consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net, increased 61.7% in fiscal year 2007 and increased 115.8% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to the previous fiscal year, respectively. The significant increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balances. The increased investment balances are the result of cash provided from operating and financing activities during the fiscal years 2006 and fiscal year 2005. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a 39.7% provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2007 compared to 38.6% in fiscal year 2006 and 39.4% in fiscal 2005. The increase in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the write off of acquired in process research and development. As of fiscal year end 2007, we do not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $43.3 million, $23.3 million and $40.4 million, respectively. Our world wide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. We have recorded liabilities to 36 Table of Contents address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings. Years Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 474,831 $ 492,176 $ 365,015 Cash provided by operating activities 169,650 125,378 84,987 Cash used in investing activities (188,141 ) (204,409 ) (126,760 ) Cash provided by financing activities 35,486 65,145 68,867 Cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments totaled $474.8 million as of September 30, 2007 compared to $492.2 million as of September 30, 2006, representing a decrease of $17.4 million. The net decrease was primarily due to cash requirements for the purchase of Acopia Networks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which were partially offset by cash flow from operations. In fiscal year 2006, overall cash and investments increased $127.2 million compared to the fiscal year 2005. The increase was due to the cash flow from operations and cash from employee stock option exercises. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2007 was $169.7 million compared to $125.4 million in fiscal year 2006 and $85.0 million in fiscal year 2005. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities as adjusted for various non cash items including stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges. Cash used in investing activities was $188.1 million for the fiscal year 2007, $204.4 million for fiscal year 2006 and $126.8 million for fiscal year 2005. The cash used in fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially offset by the sale of investments and $207.1 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to shareholders of Acopia Networks, which was acquired in September 2007. The cash used in fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment, partially offset by the sale of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment partially offset by the sale of investments Cash provided by financing activities was $35.5 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to $65.1 million and $68.9 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 our financing activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. 37 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2007: Payment Obligations by Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Operating leases $ 14,371 $ 16,500 $ 15,424 $ 12,214 $ 9,765 $ 31,442 $ 99,716 Purchase obligations 17,910 17,910 Total $ 32,281 $ 16,500 $ 15,424 $ 12,214 $ 9,765 $ 31,442 $ 117,626 We lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014. Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning October 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing this standard. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning October 1, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing this standard. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for the company beginning October 1, 2007. The impact of the Companys reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48 is expected to yield no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less, with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $9.5 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2007.

The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future. 39 Table of Contents
