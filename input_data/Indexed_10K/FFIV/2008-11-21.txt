Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements In our Annual Report on Form 10 K/A No. 2 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 (filed on December 12, 2006), we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the selected consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q/A for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006, each of which was filed on December 13, 2006. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflects our restatement. Overview We are a global provider of software and hardware products and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of application and data traffic on Internet based networks, and to optimize the performance and utilization of data storage infrastructure and other network resources. We market and sell our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, and manufacturing industries, along with government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base. 31 Table of Contents Our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those indicators include: Revenues. The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking (ADN) products; BIG IP Local Traffic Manager, BIG IP Global Traffic Manager, BIG IP ISP Traffic Manager, TrafficShield Application Firewall, WANJet, and WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN servers; and our ARX file virtualization products. We also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts, installation, training and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends. Cost of revenues and gross margins. We strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third party software license fees, amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained relatively stable over the past two years. However, factors such as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis. Operating expenses. Operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Liquidity and cash flows. Our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt. The decrease in cash and investments was primarily due to $200 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2008, largely offset by cash provided by operating activities of $193.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. Going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2008 were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash. Balance sheet. We view cash, short term and long term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued to increase due to the growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 was 51 days. We expect to maintain this metric in the mid 50 day range going forward. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. 32 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition. We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. In certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until we receive information from the channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers, in which case revenue is recognized when payments are made. Whenever product, training and post contract customer support (PCS) elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. We determine fair value based on the type of customer and region in which the package is sold. Where fair value of certain elements are not available, we recognize revenue on the residual method permitted under SOP 98 9 based on the fair value of undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out of pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed. Reserve for Doubtful Accounts. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there is deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient. Reserve for Product Returns. In some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates. Reserve for Warranties. A warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date to those customers with no service contract. While we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. Accounting for Income Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Accordingly, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our 33 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Further information may be found in Note 5, Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), using the straight line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense. We recognized $60.6 million and $41.2 million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of September 30, 2008, there was $82.9 million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward, stock based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees. We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The value of RSUs is determined using the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining the fair value of stock options, we use the Black Scholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions. Expected volatility is based on the annualized daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve managements best estimates at that time, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option. FAS 123R also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or RSUs that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we began estimating forfeitures by class of employee to better reflect our historical behavior. Based on historical differences with forfeitures of stock based awards granted to our executive officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and Board of Directors was approximately 4% and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 10%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods. Compensation cost recognized for the year ended September 30, 2008 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and (b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. In August 2008, we granted 383,400 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on August 1, 2010. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant, or a portion thereof, is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The executive officers can receive additional RSUs in amounts up 34 Table of Contents to 25% of that number of RSUs subject to this total revenue increase target if the target is exceeded. The remaining twenty five percent is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, as will be set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. In August 2007, we granted 276,400 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on August 1, 2009. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. This twenty five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008. The remaining twenty five percent is subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, as set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. In December 2006, we granted 456,000 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on November 1, 2008. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2007, relative to fiscal year 2006. This twenty five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2007. The remaining twenty five percent was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue for fiscal year 2008, relative to fiscal year 2007. This twenty five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008. We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment. On January 23, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a new program to repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2008, we had completed the repurchase and repurchased and retired approximately 7.7 million shares at an average price of $25.90 per share. Goodwill and intangible assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part, including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. In applying SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. As a result of the current economic environment, we re evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets at September 30, 2008, and concluded that there were no indicators of impairment. Investments. Our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy. We classify our investments as available for sale, which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than 35 Table of Contents temporary are included in other income (expense). To date, we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities. However, the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of our auction rate securities (ARS) using a discounted cash flow analysis. The assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates; estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ARS. We believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified these investments as long term as of September 30, 2008. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Years Ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except for percentages) Net Revenues Products $ 452,929 $ 392,921 $ 304,878 Services 197,244 132,746 89,171 Total $ 650,173 $ 525,667 $ 394,049 Percentage of net revenues Products 69.7 % 74.7 % 77.4 % Services 30.3 25.3 22.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net Revenues. Total net revenues increased 23.7% in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007, compared to an increase of 33.4% in fiscal year 2007 from fiscal year 2006. The revenue growth was due to increased demand for our core ADN products and revenue from our ARX file virtualization products. In addition, service revenues contributed to the overall revenue growth as a result of our increased installed base of products. International revenues represented 42.5%, 41.6% and 42.6% of net revenues in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels. Net product revenues increased 15.3% in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 and 28.9% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. The increase of $60.0 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of our ADN products of $45.4 million. In addition, net product revenue from our ARX file virtualization products, introduced at the end of fiscal year 2007 increased $17.6 million. Sales of our ADN products represented 92.0%, 94.5% and 93.8% of total product revenues in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net service revenues increased 48.6% in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 and 48.9% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to the fiscal year 2006. The increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts as our installed base of products continues to increase. Ingram Micro Inc., one of our domestic distributors, accounted for 10.5%, 11.6% and 13.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions, another domestic distributor, accounted for 14.0%, 13.2% and 11.6% of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions accounted for 10.5% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2008. 36 Table of Contents Years Ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except for percentages) Cost of net revenues and Gross margin Products $ 102,400 $ 84,094 $ 63,619 Services 46,618 34,230 24,534 Total 149,018 118,324 88,153 Gross margin $ 501,155 $ 407,343 $ 305,896 Cost of net revenues and Gross margin (as a percentage of related net revenue) Products 22.6 % 21.4 % 20.9 % Services 23.6 25.8 27.5 Total 22.9 22.5 22.4 Gross margin 77.1 % 77.5 % 77.6 % Cost of Net Product Revenues. Cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight, warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions. Product cost increased to $102.4 million in fiscal year 2008 as compared to $84.1 million and $63.6 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year over year increases were primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped. The fiscal year 2008 increase also included shipments of our ARX file virtualization products and increased indirect manufacturing costs over prior periods. The fiscal year 2007 increase also include an increase in warranty expense and indirect manufacturing cost over the prior period. Cost of Net Service Revenues. Cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 23.6% in fiscal year 2008 from 25.8% in fiscal year 2007 and 27.5% in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts. The absolute dollar increase year over year is primarily due to increased salary and benefits attributed to growth in headcount. Professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2008 increased to 323 from 279 at the end of fiscal year 2007 and 205 at the end of fiscal year 2006. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase our cost of service revenues to support our expanded product lines and growing customer base. 37 Table of Contents Years Ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except for percentages) Operating expenses Sales and marketing $ 237,175 $ 175,555 $ 127,478 Research and development 103,394 69,030 49,171 General and administrative 56,001 49,256 39,109 In process research and development 14,000 Loss on facility exit and sublease 5,271 Total $ 401,841 $ 307,841 $ 215,758 Operating expenses (as a percentage of net revenue) Sales and marketing 36.5 % 33.4 % 32.4 % Research and development 15.9 13.1 12.5 General and administrative 8.6 9.4 9.9 In process research and development 2.7 Loss on facility exit and sublease 0.8 Total 61.8 % 58.6 % 54.8 % Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased 35.1% in fiscal year 2008 as compared to 37.7% and 41.9% in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased commissions and personnel costs which totaled $42.3 million, $25.4 million and $21.0 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding periods. The fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior period was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 716 from 669 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 442 at the end of fiscal 2006. Stock based compensation charges of $24.1 million, $15.8 million and $10.1 million also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect to continue to increase sales and marketing expenses in order to grow revenues and increase our market share. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel, prototype materials and expenses related to the development of new and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Research and development expenses increased 49.8% in fiscal year 2008 as compared to increases of 40.4% and 56.0% in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnel costs which totaled $19.7 million, $12.2 million and $8.4 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding periods. The fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior period was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007. Research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 460 from 450 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 287 at the end of fiscal 2006. The growth in headcount was primarily related to the enhancement of our current products, the development of new, technologically advanced products that meet the changing needs of our customers and additional headcount related to our ARX file virtualization products. Stock based compensation charges of $16.3 million, $10.2 million and $6.9 million also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued development of our products. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and related costs of our executive, finance, information technology, human resource and legal personnel, third party 38 Table of Contents professional service fees, bad debt charges, facilities, and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 13.7% in fiscal year 2008 as compared with 25.9% in fiscal year 2007 and 53.5% in fiscal year 2006. The increase in fiscal year 2008 of $6.7 million was due primarily to an increase of $3.2 million in stock based compensation charges and an increase of $3.5 million in salary and benefit expenses. The increase in fiscal year 2007 of $10.1 million was due primarily to increases of $6.5 million in stock based compensation charges, $4.0 million in salary and benefit expenses and $3.1 million in other general operating expenses. General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2008 increased to 195 from 184 at the end of fiscal 2007 and 134 at the end of fiscal 2006. General and administrative expense is expected to remain at these increased levels as we continue to build our infrastructure to support the worldwide growth of our business. In process research and development. Acquired in process research and development (IPRD) expense was $14.0 million in 2007 and reflects the amount allocated to IPRD that we acquired in the Acopia Networks, Inc. (Acopia) acquisition. IPRD represents the present value of estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility. We based our estimates and projections related to IPRD on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If we do not successfully develop this product, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Loss on facility exit and sublease. During 2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue, Washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle, Washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 pursuant to SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146), and FTB No. 79 15, Accounting for Loss on a Sublease Not Involving the Disposal of a Segment (FTB 79 15). Years Ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except for percentages) Other Income and Income Taxes Income from operations $ 99,314 $ 99,502 $ 90,138 Other income, net 18,950 28,191 17,431 Income before income taxes 118,264 127,693 107,569 Provision for income taxes 43,933 50,693 41,564 Net income $ 74,331 $ 77,000 $ 66,005 Other Income and Income Taxes (as percentage of net revenue) Income from operations 15.3 % 18.9 % 22.9 % Other income, net 2.9 5.4 4.4 Income before income taxes 18.2 24.3 27.3 Provision for income taxes 6.8 9.6 10.5 Net income 11.4 % 14.6 % 16.8 % Other Income, Net. Other income, net, consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net decreased 32.8% in fiscal year 2008, as compared to fiscal year 2007 and increased 61.7% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to the fiscal years 2006. Interest income was $17.5 million, $27.3 million and $17.2 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased interest income as a result of reduced investment balances, partially offset by cash provided from operating and investing 39 Table of Contents activities. Investment balances decreased in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program and additional cash required for the acquisition of Acopia in September 2007. The fiscal year 2007 increase was due to a combination of higher yields and increased investment balance over the prior period. The increased investment balances in fiscal year 2007 and 2006 are the result of additional cash provided from operating and financing activities during the respective fiscal years. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a 37.1% provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2008 compared to 39.7% in fiscal year 2007 and 38.6% in fiscal year 2006. The reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal year end 2007 to fiscal year end 2008 is largely attributable to an increase in the U.S. Domestic Manufacturing Deduction and a decrease in the limitation on deductibility of the compensation of certain officers. At September 30, 2008, we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $52.8 million, $43.3 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. We have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities. Years Ended September 30, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 451,272 $ 474,831 $ 492,176 Cash provided by operating activities 193,692 169,650 125,378 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 13,710 (188,141 ) (204,409 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (181,719 ) 35,486 65,145 Cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments totaled $451.3 million as of September 30, 2008 compared to $474.8 million as of September 30, 2007, representing a decrease of $23.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $200 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2008 which amount was largely offset by cash provided by operating activities of $193.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. In fiscal year 2007, overall cash provided by investing activities decreased $17.4 million compared to fiscal year 2006. The net decrease was primarily due to cash requirements for the purchase of Acopia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which amounts were partially offset by cash flow from operations. At September 30, 2008, we held $52.3 million (par value) of long term investments comprised of tax exempt ARS, which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest being reset through Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28 or 35 days. The securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer. Interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semi annually. We limit our investments in ARS to securities that carry an AAA (or equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. 40 Table of Contents At the time of initial investment and at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, all of our ARS remain AAA rated. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS are presently at risk of default. Through September 30, 2008, we have continued to receive interest payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities. However, due to recent changes and uncertainty in the ARS market, we believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified these investments as long term as of September 30, 2008. We currently have the ability and the intent to hold these ARS investments until recovery of the auction process or until maturity. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2008 was $193.7 million compared to $169.7 million in fiscal year 2007 and $125.4 million in fiscal year 2006. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non cash charges such as stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by investing activities was $13.7 million for fiscal year 2008, compared to cash used in investing activities of $188.1 million for fiscal year 2007 and $204.4 million for fiscal year 2006. The cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the result of the sale of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially offset by the sale of investments and $207.1 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to shareholders of Acopia, which was acquired in September 2007. The cash used in fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the purchase of investments and property and equipment, partially offset by the sale of investments. Cash used in financing activities was $181.7 million for fiscal year 2008, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $35.5 million and $65.1 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $200 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included $200 million to repurchase common stock under this plan, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006 our financing activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. We expect that our existing cash and investment balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. 41 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2008: Payment Obligations by Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Operating leases $ 17,917 $ 17,300 $ 13,726 $ 11,229 $ 6,830 $ 25,676 $ 92,678 Purchase obligations 17,783 17,783 Total $ 35,700 $ 17,300 $ 13,726 $ 11,229 $ 6,830 $ 25,676 $ 110,461 We lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2018. We have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately $4.2 million related to unrecognized income tax benefits as of September 30, 2008, due to the adoption of FASB interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. We cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation. Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS 160), which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning October 1, 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair value as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after October 1, 2009. This standard will change the Companys accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), which allows entities to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning October 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of implementing this standard but does not expect it to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB released a FASB Staff Position (FSP FAS 157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157) which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted this standard on October 1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect if any of 42 Table of Contents implementing this standard but does not expect it to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less, with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.7 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2008.

ARS are collateralized long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ARS will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. We have the intent and ability to hold these securities until liquidation. These securities have been classified as long term at September 30, 2008 based on the fact that we believe it could take longer than twelve months to liquidate the positions. Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future. 44
