Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other characterizations of future events or circumstances and are generally identified by the words expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, and similar expressions. These forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to revise or update any such forward looking statements. Overview We are a global provider of appliances consisting of software and hardware and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of application and data traffic on Internet based networks, and to optimize the performance and utilization of data storage infrastructure and other network resources. We market and sell our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in the technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base. Our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those indicators include: Revenues. The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking (ADN) products; BIG IP Local Traffic Manager, BIG IP Global Traffic Manager, BIG IP ISP Traffic Manager, TrafficShield Application Firewall, WANJet, and WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN servers; and our ARX file virtualization products. We also derive revenues from the sales of services including annual maintenance contracts, training and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales 30 Table of Contents mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are key indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends. Cost of revenues and gross margins. We strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third party software license fees, amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained relatively stable, however, factors such as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis. Operating expenses. Operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Liquidity and cash flows. Our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $202.0 million. This increase was partially offset by $87.4 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2009. Going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 were comprised primarily of tenant improvements and information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash. Balance sheet. We view cash, short term and long term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2009 due to the growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was 55 days. We expect to maintain this metric in the mid 50 day range going forward. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition. We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no significant obligations remain. In certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until we receive information from the channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 90 days based on normal and customary trade practices in the 31 Table of Contents individual markets. We have offered extended payment terms ranging from three to six months to certain customers, in which case revenue is recognized when payments are made. Whenever product, training and post contract customer support (PCS) elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled package based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. We determine fair value based on the type of customer and region in which the package is sold. Where fair value of certain elements are not available, we recognize revenue on the residual method based on the fair value of undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out of pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed. Reserve for Doubtful Accounts. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there is deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient. Reserve for Product Returns. In some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates. Accounting for Income Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation using the straight line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award. We recognized $56.1 million and $60.6 million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of September 30, 2009, there was $82.5 million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward, stock based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees. We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). The value of RSUs is determined using the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. Alternatively, in determining the fair value of stock options, we use the Black Scholes option pricing model that employs the following key assumptions. Expected volatility is based on the annualized 32 Table of Contents daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option. Expected term of the option is based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior, the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years. Our stock price volatility and option lives involve managements best estimates at that time, both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black Scholes methodology and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or RSUs that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. Based on historical differences with forfeitures of stock based awards granted to our executive officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups. In fiscal 2009, the average estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and Board of Directors was approximately 4% and the average estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 11%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods. In August 2009, we granted 420,000 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on August 1, 2011. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant, or a portion thereof, is subject to our achievement of specified quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. Fifty percent of the quarterly performance stock grant is based on achieving at least 80% of the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50% is based on achieving at least 80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal (the 2009 Performance Award). The quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80% of the targeted goals. At least 100% of both goals must be attained in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded over 100%. Each goal is evaluated individually and subject to the 80% achievement threshold and 100% over achievement threshold. The remaining twenty five percent is subject to our achievement of specified quarterly goals during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, as will be set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. In August 2008, we granted 383,400 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, until such portion of the grant is fully vested on August 1, 2010. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant, or a portion thereof, was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 (the 2008 Performance Award). Approximately half of this twenty five percent was earned in fiscal 2009. The remaining twenty five percent or a portion thereof, is subject to our achievement of specified quarterly revenue and EBITDA goals during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. Fifty percent of the quarterly performance stock grant is based on achieving at least 80% of the quarterly revenue goal and the other 50% is based on achieving at least 80% of the quarterly EBITDA goal. The quarterly performance stock grant is paid linearly above 80% of the targeted goals. At least 100% of both goals must be attained in order for the quarterly performance stock grant to be awarded over 100%. Each goal is evaluated individually and subject to the 80% achievement threshold and 100% over achievement threshold. In August 2007, we granted 276,400 RSUs to certain current executive officers. Fifty percent of the aggregate number of RSUs granted at such time vest in equal quarterly increments over two years, and was fully vested on August 1, 2009. Twenty five percent of the RSU grant was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 (the 2007 Performance Award). This twenty five percent was fully earned in fiscal 2008. The remaining twenty five percent was subject to our achievement of specified percentage increases in total revenue during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, relative to the same periods in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Approximately half of this twenty five percent was earned in fiscal 2009. 33 Table of Contents We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment. Performance conditions for these awards were not met in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2009 and as such, no compensation cost was incurred. Common stock repurchase. On October 22, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our outstanding common stock. As of November 18, 2009, we had repurchased and retired 3,482,597 shares at an average price of $26.94 per share. Goodwill and intangible assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist. Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part, including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. We review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred, while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In March 2009, we completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company has considered the assumptions used in the test and notes that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge. Additionally, as a result of the current economic environment, we considered potential impairment indicators at September 30, 2009 and noted no indicators of impairment. Investments. Our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy. The majority of our investments are classified as available for sale, and are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense). To date, we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities. However, the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results. Our investments also include auction rate securities (ARS) that are classified as available for sale and as trading investment securities. ARS that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. We believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified these investments as long term as of September 30, 2009. ARS securities classified as trading investment securities are reported at fair value with the related changes in fair value recorded to other income (expense). These ARS have been classified as short term, as we have the opportunity to liquidate these securities within the next twelve months through a guaranteed program with our investment manager. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ARS using a discounted cash flow analysis. The assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates; estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ARS. 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Years Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except for percentages) Net Revenues Products $ 406,529 $ 452,929 $ 392,921 Services 246,550 197,244 132,746 Total $ 653,079 $ 650,173 $ 525,667 Percentage of net revenues Products 62.2 % 69.7 % 74.7 % Services 37.8 30.3 25.3 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net Revenues. Total net revenues increased slightly in fiscal year 2009 from the prior year, compared to an increase of 23.7% in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007. Given the current economic environment, we did not experience the same level of net revenue growth that we have had in prior periods and as a result net revenue for fiscal year 2009 remained relatively flat with fiscal 2008. The change in net revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of product sales, offset by an increase in service revenue as a result of our increased installed base of products. International revenues represented 44.7%, 42.5% and 41.6% of net revenues in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels. Net product revenues decreased 10.2% in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008 and increased 15.3% in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. The decrease of $46.4 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a $36.1 million reduction in the volume of sales of our ADN products, a $5.4 million reduction in the sales of our ARX file virtualization products, and a $4.9 million reduction in the volume of sales of our FirePass products, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of our ADN products represented 93.7%, 92.0% and 94.5% of total product revenues in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net service revenues increased 25.0% in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008 and increased 48.6% in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007. The increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products. Avnet Technology Solutions, one of our worldwide distributors, accounted for 15.4%, 14.0% and 13.2% of our total net revenue in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Ingram Micro, Inc., another worldwide distributor, accounted for 10.5% and 11.6% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. No other distributors accounted for more than 10% of total net revenue. 35 Table of Contents Years Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except for percentages) Cost of net revenues and Gross margin Products $ 95,209 $ 102,400 $ 84,094 Services 47,517 46,618 34,230 Total 142,726 149,018 118,324 Gross margin $ 510,353 $ 501,155 $ 407,343 Cost of net revenues and Gross margin (as a percentage of related net revenue) Products 23.4 % 22.6 % 21.4 % Services 19.3 23.6 25.8 Total 21.9 22.9 22.5 Gross margin 78.1 % 77.1 % 77.5 % Cost of Net Product Revenues. Cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight, warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions. Product cost decreased to $95.2 million in fiscal year 2009 as compared to $102.4 million in fiscal year 2008. The year over year decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of units shipped. In fiscal year 2008, the year over year increase from $84.1 million in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to a higher volume of units shipped. The fiscal year 2008 increase also included shipments of our ARX file virtualization products and increased indirect manufacturing costs over prior periods. Cost of Net Service Revenues. Cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 19.3% in fiscal year 2009 from 23.6% in fiscal year 2008 and 25.8% in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts. Professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2009 increased to 330 from 323 at the end of fiscal year 2008 and 279 at the end of fiscal year 2007. In addition, cost of net service revenues included stock based compensation expense of $4.8 million, $4.0 million and $2.4 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Years Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except for percentages) Operating expenses Sales and marketing $ 225,193 $ 237,175 $ 175,555 Research and development 103,664 103,394 69,030 General and administrative 55,243 56,001 49,256 In process research and development 14,000 Loss on facility exit and sublease 5,271 Restructuring charges 4,329 Total $ 388,429 $ 401,841 $ 307,841 Operating expenses (as a percentage of net revenue) Sales and marketing 34.5 % 36.5 % 33.4 % Research and development 15.9 15.9 13.1 General and administrative 8.4 8.6 9.4 In process research and development 2.7 Loss on facility exit and sublease 0.8 Restructuring charges 0.7 Total 59.5 % 61.8 % 58.6 % Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expense decreased 5.1% in fiscal year 2009 as compared to year over year increases of 35.1% and 37.7% in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives we implemented in response to the slowing economic environment and a $6.9 million decrease in commissions expense corresponding to the decrease in product revenue for fiscal year 2009, compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior year was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 696 from 716 at the end of fiscal 2008 and 669 at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring program. Sales and marketing expense included stock based compensation charges of $22.6 million, $24.1 million and $15.8 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel, prototype materials and other expenses related to the development of new and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. In fiscal year 2009, research and development expenses remained relatively consistent with the prior year as compared to year over year increases of 49.8% and 40.4% in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in research and development expense in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to increased personnel costs which totaled $19.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively, which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding periods. The fiscal year 2008 increase over the prior year was also attributed to a full year of expenses related to our ARX file virtualization personnel as compared to the 17 days of comparable expenses in fiscal year 2007. Research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 430 from 460 at the end of fiscal 2008 and 450 at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring program. Research and development expense included stock based compensation charges of $16.7 million, $16.3 million and $10.2 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect research and development expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future. 37 Table of Contents General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and related costs of our executive, finance, information technology, human resource and legal personnel, third party professional service fees, bad debt charges, facilities and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent in fiscal year 2009 as compared with year over year increases of 13.7% in fiscal year 2008 and 25.9% in fiscal year 2007. The increase in fiscal year 2008 of $6.7 million was due primarily to an increase of $3.2 million in stock based compensation charges and an increase of $3.5 million in salary and benefit expenses. General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2009 decreased to 190 from 195 at the end of fiscal 2008 and increased from 184 at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in headcount was primarily related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the second fiscal quarter of 2009 as part of our restructuring program. General and administrative expense included stock based compensation charges of $11.6 million, $15.9 million and $12.6 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In process Research and Development. Acquired in process research and development (IPRD) expense was $14.0 million in 2007 and reflects the amount allocated to IPRD that we acquired in the Acopia Networks, Inc. (Acopia) acquisition. IPRD represents the present value of estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility. We based our estimates and projections related to IPRD on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If we do not successfully develop this product, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Loss on Facility Exit and Sublease. During 2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue, Washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle, Washington for which there were remaining operating lease obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Restructuring. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain operating expenses. Restructuring actions included the consolidation of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements and a reduction in workforce. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring expenses of $4.3 million, which included a $2.1 million charge for severance and related costs and a $2.2 million charge for the exit of certain offices worldwide. We had $0.6 million of accrued restructuring cost at September 30, 2009, which we expect to offset future rent expenses through September 2012. 38 Table of Contents Years Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands, except for percentages) Other Income and Income Taxes Income from operations $ 121,924 $ 99,314 $ 99,502 Other income, net 9,724 18,950 28,191 Income before income taxes 131,648 118,264 127,693 Provision for income taxes 40,113 43,933 50,693 Net income $ 91,535 $ 74,331 $ 77,000 Other Income and Income Taxes (as percentage of net revenue) Income from operations 18.7 % 15.3 % 18.9 % Other income, net 1.5 2.9 5.4 Income before income taxes 20.2 18.2 24.3 Provision for income taxes 6.2 6.8 9.6 Net income 14.0 % 11.4 % 14.6 % Other Income, Net.

The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to decreased interest income of $7.6 million and decreased foreign currency transaction gains of $1.5 million. The decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to decreased interest income as a result of reduced investment balances. Investment balances decreased in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program and additional cash required for the acquisition of Acopia in September 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a 30.5% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2009 compared to 37.1% in fiscal year 2008 and 39.7% in fiscal year 2007. The reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009 is largely attributable to the deduction for tax purposes of compensation related to equity awards in a major foreign tax jurisdiction, the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit in fiscal year 2009 and deductions obtained for U.S. tax purposes relative to the cessation of operations of a foreign subsidiary in the quarter ending September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $57.0 million, $52.8 million and $43.3 million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. We have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense. In addition, on May 4, 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama proposed significant changes to the U.S. international tax laws that would limit U.S. deductions for expenses related to un repatriated foreign source income and modify the 39 Table of Contents U.S. foreign tax credit and check the box rules. We cannot determine whether these proposals will be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If the U.S. tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligation, our operating results could suffer. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities. Years Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 574,422 $ 451,272 $ 474,831 Cash provided by operating activities 201,981 193,692 169,650 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (99,109 ) 13,710 (188,141 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (70,706 ) (181,719 ) 35,486 Cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments totaled $574.4 million as of September 30, 2009 compared to $451.3 million as of September 30, 2008, representing an increase of $123.2 million. The increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $202.0 million for fiscal year 2009, compared to $193.7 million for fiscal year 2008, which was partially offset by $87.4 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2009. In fiscal year 2008, the decrease was primarily due to approximately $200 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program in fiscal 2008, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $193.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2009, we held $40.1 million of tax exempt ARS, which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rates being reset through Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28 or 35 days. The securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer. Interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semi annually. We limit our investments in ARS to securities that carry a AAA/A (or equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At the time of initial investment and at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, all of our ARS were in compliance with our investment policy. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS are presently at risk of default. Through September 30, 2009, we have continued to receive interest payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities. However, due to recent changes and uncertainty in the ARS market, we believe certain of these available for sale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified $19.0 million (par value) of securities as long term as of September 30, 2009. In October 2008, we entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with UBS whereby UBS would purchase eligible ARS it sold to us prior to February 13, 2008. Under the terms of the Agreement, and at our discretion, UBS will purchase eligible ARS from us at par value (Put Option) during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. Amounts eligible total $26.1 million (par value) at September 30, 2009. We expect to sell our eligible ARS under the Agreement. However, if we do not exercise our rights to sell our eligible 40 Table of Contents ARS under the Agreement before July 2, 2012 the Put Option will expire and UBS will have no further rights or obligations to buy our ARS. So long as we hold our ARS, they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ARS if the auction process fails. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we transferred these ARS from available for sale to trading investment securities. We elected to measure the Put Option under the fair value option, and recorded a benefit in other income of approximately $1.5 million pre tax for the year ended September 30, 2009, and recorded a corresponding long term investment. As a result of accepting the Put Option and reclassifying the ARS from available for sale to trading investment securities, we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million pre tax as of September 30, 2009, reflecting a reversal of the related unrealized loss that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss. The recording of the fair value of the Put Option and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss resulted in no impact to the consolidated income statement for the year ended September 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2009 was $202.0 million compared to $193.7 million in fiscal year 2008 and $169.7 million in fiscal year 2007. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non cash charges such as stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in investing activities was $99.1 million for fiscal year 2009, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $13.7 million for fiscal year 2008 and cash used in investing activities of $188.1 million for fiscal year 2007. The cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the maturity of investments. The cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the result of the maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments. The cash used in fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments partially offset by the sale of investments and $207.1 million of cash payments, net of cash acquired, to shareholders of Acopia, which was acquired in September 2007. Cash used in financing activities was $70.7 million for fiscal year 2009, compared to cash used in financing activities of $181.7 million for fiscal year 2008 and cash provided by financing activities of $35.5 million in fiscal years 2007. In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our outstanding common stock. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 included $87.4 million to repurchase common stock under this plan, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included $200 million to repurchase common stock under a previous stock repurchase program, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. During fiscal year 2007 our financing activities consisted entirely of cash proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment balances, excluding ARS, together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2009: Payment Obligations by Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Operating leases $ 17,704 $ 14,371 $ 11,905 $ 7,102 $ 6,603 $ 20,402 $ 78,087 Purchase obligations 15,497 15,497 Total $ 33,201 $ 14,371 $ 11,905 $ 7,102 $ 6,603 $ 20,402 $ 93,584 41 Table of Contents We lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2018. Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810 10, Consolidation Overall (ASC 810 10), which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. ASC 810 10 is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning October 1, 2009 and the Company does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), which establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair value as of the acquisition date. ASC 805 is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after October 1, 2009. This standard will change the Companys accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 820 10 65, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Overall Transition and Open Effective Date Information (ASC 820 10 65). ASC 820 10 65 provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset/liability has significantly decreased. This statement also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. In addition, ASC 820 10 65 requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques. The Company adopted the statement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of ASC 820 10 65 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 320 10, Investments Debt and Equity Securities Overall (ASC 320 10). This guidance amends the requirements for the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments for debt securities by modifying the pre existing intent and ability indicator. Under ASC 320 10, an other than temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security, it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery, or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Additionally, this guidance changes the presentation of an other than temporary impairment in the income statement for those impairments involving credit losses. The credit loss component will be recognized in earnings and the remainder of the impairment will be recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASC 320 10 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this statement did not impact the Company as there have been no credit losses or other than temporary impairment losses on the Companys available for sale securities in prior periods. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 825 10 65, Financial Instruments Overall Transition and Open Effective Date Information (ASC 825 10 65). This guidance requires interim disclosures regarding the fair values of financial instruments that are within the scope of ASC 825 10. Additionally, this guidance requires disclosure of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis as well as changes of the methods and significant assumptions from prior periods. The Company adopted ASC 820 10 65 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this statement does not change the accounting treatment for these financial instruments. In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855 10, Subsequent Events Overall (ASC 855 10), which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. It requires the disclosure of the date 42 Table of Contents through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for selecting that date, that is, whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued. The Company adopted ASC 855 10 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition) (ASU 2009 13) and ASU 2009 14, Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985, Software) (ASU 2009 14). ASU 2009 13 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU 2009 14 removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2009 13 or ASU 2009 14 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less, with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.3 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2009. Maturing in Three Months Three Months Greater Than or Less to One Year One Year Total Fair Value (In thousands, except for percentages) September 30, 2009 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 19,790 $ $ $ 19,790 $ 19,790 Weighted average interest rate 1.0 % Included in short term investments $ 59,981 $ 146,310 $ $ 206,291 $ 206,291 Weighted average interest rates 3.1 % 3.0 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 257,294 $ 257,294 $ 257,294 Weighted average interest rates 2.8 % September 30, 2008 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 16,570 $ $ $ 16,570 $ 16,570 Weighted average interest rate 3.3 % Included in short term investments $ 28,019 $ 83,864 $ $ 111,883 $ 111,883 Weighted average interest rates 5.6 % 4.4 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 261,086 $ 261,086 $ 261,086 Weighted average interest rates 4.6 % September 30, 2007 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 7,965 $ $ $ 7,965 $ 7,965 Weighted average interest rate 5.1 % Included in short term investments $ 123,044 $ 81,125 $ $ 204,169 $ 204,169 Weighted average interest rates 5.3 % 5.0 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 216,366 $ 216,366 $ 216,366 Weighted average interest rates 5.2 % 43 Table of Contents At September 30, 2009, the fair value of our AAA/A (or equivalent) rated municipal ARS was approximately $40.1 million. ARS are collateralized long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, we exercise the Put Option with UBS, or the security matures. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ARS will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. We have no intent to sell, wont be required to sell, and believe we will hold these securities until recovery. The trading investment securities of $24.6 million (par value) have been classified as short term and the available for sale securities of $15.5 million (par value) have been classified as long term at September 30, 2009. Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future. 44 Table of Contents
