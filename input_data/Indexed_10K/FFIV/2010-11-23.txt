Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other characterizations of future events or circumstances and are generally identified by the words expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, and similar expressions. These forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to revise or update any such forward looking statements. Overview We are a global provider of appliances consisting of software and hardware and services that help companies efficiently and securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of application and data traffic on Internet based networks, and to optimize the performance and utilization of data storage infrastructure and other network resources. We market and sell our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in the technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base. Our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those indicators include: Revenues. The majority of our revenues are derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking (ADN) products and related software modules; BIG IP Local Traffic Manager, BIG IP Global Traffic Manager, BIG IP Link Controller, BIG IP Application Security Manager, BIG IP Edge Gateway, BIG IP WAN Optimization module, BIG IP Access Policy Manager, and WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN appliance; and our ARX file virtualization products. We also derive revenues from the sales of 31 Table of Contents services including annual maintenance contracts, training and consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements are indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as additional indicators of current and future trends. Cost of revenues and gross margins. We strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third party software license fees, amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained relatively stable; however, factors such as sales price, product mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we monitor on a regular basis. Operating expenses. Operating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, computer costs related to the development of new products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Liquidity and cash flows. Our financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $313.6 million. This increase was partially offset by $75.0 million of cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2010. Going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2010 were comprised primarily of information technology infrastructure and equipment to support the growth of our core business activities. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash. Balance sheet. We view cash, short term and long term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued to increase in fiscal 2010 due to growth in the amount of annual maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 was 40. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition. We sell products through distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no significant performance obligations remain. In certain regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate returns, we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until they have received information from the channel partner indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net 30 days to net 45 days. Payment terms to international customers range from net 30 days to net 120 days based on normal and customary trade practices 32 Table of Contents in the individual markets. We offer extended payment terms to certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when payments are due. Whenever product, training services and post contract customer support (PCS) elements are sold together, a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately. Where fair value of certain elements is not available, we recognize revenue on the residual method based on the fair value of undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the product. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates, plus out of pocket expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed. FASB ASC Topic 985 605 25, Software, Revenue Recognition, Multiple Element Arrangements, (ASC 985 605 25), as amended, requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements. The fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). We establish VSOE for our products, training services, PCS and consulting services based on the sales price charged for each element when sold separately. The sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based on various factors including the type of customer, volume of sales, geographic region and program level. Our list prices are generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the factors enumerated above. We believe that the fair value of our consulting services is represented by the billable consulting rate per hour, based on the rates we charge customers when they purchase standalone consulting services. The price of consulting services is not based on the type of customer, volume of sales, geographic region or program level. We use historical sales transactions to determine whether VSOE can be established for each of the elements. In most instances, VSOE of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone (unbundled) transactions within the past 12 month period that are priced within a reasonable range, which we have determined to be plus or minus 15% of the median sales price of each respective price list. VSOE of PCS is based on standalone sales since we do not provide stated renewal rates to our customers. In accordance with our PCS pricing practice (supported by standalone renewal sales), renewal contracts are priced as a percentage of the undiscounted product list price. The PCS renewal percentages may vary, depending on the type and length of PCS purchased. We offer standard and premium PCS, and the term generally ranges from one to three years. We employ a bell shaped curve approach in evaluating VSOE of fair value of PCS. Under this approach, we consider VSOE of the fair value of PCS to exist when a substantial majority of our standalone PCS sales fall within a narrow range of pricing. We have established and regularly validate the VSOE of fair value for elements in our multiple element arrangements. We account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded from revenues. Reserve for Doubtful Accounts. Estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate historical write offs, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there is deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient. Reserve for Product Returns. In some instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future 33 Table of Contents returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors. It is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates. Accounting for Income Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation using the straight line attribution method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award. We recognized $70.8 million and $56.1 million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of September 30, 2010, there was $98.4 million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over the next two years. Going forward, stock based compensation expenses may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees. We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of restricted stock units (RSUs). The value of RSUs is determined using the fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. No stock options were granted in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of RSUs that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior. Based on historical differences with forfeitures of stock based awards granted to our executive officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations for these two groups. In fiscal year 2010, the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and Board of Directors was approximately 3% and the estimated forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was approximately 10%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods. We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs based on our probability assessment. Common stock repurchase. On October 22, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our outstanding common stock. On October 26, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of our outstanding common stock. As of November 18, 2010, we had repurchased and retired 4,605,827 shares at an average price of $37.15 per share. Goodwill and intangible assets. We have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to five years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist. Projected undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying amounts to determine whether any impairment exists. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part, including the useful 34 Table of Contents life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized, and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows, which are based upon further estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. We review our goodwill annually for impairment in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred, while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In March 2010, we completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. We have considered the assumptions used in the test and noted that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge. Additionally, we considered potential impairment indicators at September 30, 2010 and noted no indicators of impairment. Investments. Our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy. We classify our investments as available for sale, which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value of these investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense). To date, we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities. However, the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results. Our investments also include auction rate securities (ARS) that are classified as available for sale. ARS are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. We believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified these investments as long term as of September 30, 2010. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of our ARS using a discounted cash flow analysis. The assumptions we used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates; estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors, amount of cash flows and expected holding periods for the ARS. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Years Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except for percentages) Net Revenues Products $ 561,142 $ 406,529 $ 452,929 Services 320,830 246,550 197,244 Total $ 881,972 $ 653,079 $ 650,173 Percentage of net revenues Products 63.6 % 62.2 % 69.7 % Services 36.4 37.8 30.3 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net Revenues. Total net revenues increased 35.0% in fiscal year 2010 from the prior year, compared to only a slight increase in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008. Overall revenue growth for the year ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to increased product and service revenues as a result of our increased installed base of products and increased demand for our core ADN products, including application security and WAN optimization products. International revenues represented 41.4%, 44.7% and 42.5% of net revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect international sales will continue to represent a 35 Table of Contents significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net revenues will remain at current levels. Net product revenues increased 38.0% in fiscal year 2010 from fiscal year 2009 and decreased 10.2% in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008. The increase of $154.6 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of our ADN products of $154.8, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our FirePass products of $2.6 million. In addition, net product revenue from our ARX file virtualization products increased $2.3 million in fiscal year 2010. The decrease of $46.4 million in net product sales for fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to a $36.1 million reduction in the volume of sales of our ADN products, a $5.4 million reduction in the sales of our ARX file virtualization products, and a $4.9 million reduction in the volume of sales of our FirePass products, as compared to the prior year. Sales of our ADN products represented 95.4%, 93.7% and 92.0% of total product revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net service revenues increased 30.1% in fiscal year 2010 from fiscal year 2009 and increased 25.0% in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008. The increases in service revenue were the result of increased purchases or renewals of maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base of products. Avnet Technology Solutions, one of our worldwide distributors, accounted for 14.5%, 15.4% and 14.0% of our total net revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Tech Data, another worldwide distributor, accounted for 10.2% of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2010. Ingram Micro, Inc., another worldwide distributor, accounted for 10.5% of our total net revenues in fiscal year 2008. Avnet Technology Solutions, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 13.2%, 11.8% and 13.2% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2010, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 11.6% and 10.7% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2009, respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions accounted for 10.5% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2008. No other distributors accounted for more than 10% of total net revenue or receivables for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except for percentages) Cost of net revenues and Gross margin Products $ 113,834 $ 95,209 $ 102,400 Services 58,118 47,517 46,618 Total 171,952 142,726 149,018 Gross margin $ 710,020 $ 510,353 $ 501,155 Cost of net revenues and Gross margin (as a percentage of related net revenue) Products 20.3 % 23.4 % 22.6 % Services 18.1 19.3 23.6 Total 19.5 21.9 22.9 Gross margin 80.5 % 78.1 % 77.1 % Cost of Net Product Revenues. Cost of net product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight, warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and amortization expenses in connection with developed technology from acquisitions. Product cost increased to $113.8 million in fiscal year 2010 from $95.2 million in fiscal year 2009. The year over year increase was primarily due to the higher volume of units shipped and an increase in warranty expense, partially offset by a decrease in expense related to obsolete inventory. Product cost as a percentage of related net revenue decreased to 20.3% in fiscal year 2010 from 23.4% in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to reduced manufacturing costs and decreased indirect product costs. In fiscal year 2009, the year over year decrease from $102.4 million in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of units shipped. 36 Table of Contents Cost of Net Service Revenues. Cost of net service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of our professional services staff, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to 18.1% in fiscal year 2010 from 19.3% in fiscal year 2009 and 23.6% in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the scalability of our existing customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from maintenance contracts. Professional services headcount at the end of fiscal year 2010 increased to 421 from 330 at the end of fiscal year 2009 and 323 at the end of fiscal year 2008. In addition, cost of net service revenues included stock based compensation expense of $6.0 million, $4.8 million and $4.0 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Years Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except for percentages) Operating expenses Sales and marketing $ 293,201 $ 225,193 $ 237,175 Research and development 118,314 103,664 103,394 General and administrative 68,503 55,243 56,001 Loss on facility exit and sublease 5,271 Restructuring charges 4,329 Total $ 480,018 $ 388,429 $ 401,841 Operating expenses (as a percentage of net revenue) Sales and marketing 33.2 % 34.5 % 36.5 % Research and development 13.4 15.9 15.9 General and administrative 7.8 8.4 8.6 Loss on facility exit and sublease 0.8 Restructuring charges 0.7 Total 54.4 % 59.5 % 61.8 % Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expense increased 30.2% in fiscal year 2010 as compared to a year over year decrease of 5.1% in fiscal year 2009 and a year over year increase of 35.1% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to an increase in commissions and personnel costs of $43.9 million, compared to the prior year. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal year 2010 was also due to an increase of $9.2 million in marketing promotions and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and our products. The fiscal year 2009 decrease over the prior year was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives we implemented in response to the slowing economic environment and a $6.9 million decrease in commissions expense corresponding to the decrease in product revenue for fiscal year 2009, compared to the prior year. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 856 from 696 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 716 at the end of fiscal 2008. Sales and marketing expense included stock based compensation charges of $27.3 million, $22.6 million and $24.1 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel, prototype materials and other expenses related to the development of new and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses. Research and development expense increased 14.1% in fiscal year 2010, compared to the prior year. The increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to increased personnel costs of $7.1 million, which is consistent with the increase in revenue for the corresponding period. In addition, research and development expense included a year over year increase in computer equipment and software costs of $3.8 million to support the development of new and improved products. In fiscal year 2009, research and 37 Table of Contents development expenses remained relatively consistent with the prior year as compared to a year over year increase of 49.8% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in research and development expense for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to increased personnel costs of $19.7 million, which is consistent with the increased revenue for the corresponding period. Research and development headcount at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 509 from 430 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 460 at the end of fiscal 2008. Research and development expense included stock based compensation charges of $19.4 million, $16.7 million and $16.3 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect research and development expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and related costs of our executive, finance, information technology, human resource and legal personnel, third party professional service fees, bad debt charges, facilities and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expense increased 24.0% in fiscal year 2010, compared to the prior year. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase of $4.1 million in personnel costs for the year ended September 30, 2010, compared to the prior year. General and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent in fiscal year 2009 as compared with a year over year increase of 13.7% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in fiscal year 2008 of $6.7 million was due primarily to an increase of $3.2 million in stock based compensation charges and an increase of $3.5 million in salary and benefit expenses. General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 226 from 190 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 195 at the end of fiscal 2008. General and administrative expense included stock based compensation charges of $17.0 million, $11.6 million and $15.9 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Loss on Facility Exit and Sublease. During 2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue, Washington for which there was remaining operating lease obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle, Washington for which there were remaining operating lease obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Restructuring. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain operating expenses. Restructuring actions included the consolidation of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant improvements and a reduction in workforce. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring expenses of $4.3 million, which included a $2.1 million charge for severance and related costs and a $2.2 million charge for the exit of certain offices worldwide. All accrued restructuring costs had been incurred as of September 30, 2010. Years Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except for percentages) Other Income and Income Taxes Income from operations $ 230,002 $ 121,924 $ 99,314 Other income, net 7,625 9,724 18,950 Income before income taxes 237,627 131,648 118,264 Provision for income taxes 86,474 40,113 43,933 Net income $ 151,153 $ 91,535 $ 74,331 Other Income and Income Taxes (as percentage of net revenue) Income from operations 26.1 % 18.7 % 15.3 % Other income, net 0.8 1.5 2.9 Income before income taxes 26.9 20.2 18.2 Provision for income taxes 9.8 6.2 6.8 Net income 17.1 % 14.0 % 11.4 % 38 Table of Contents Other Income, Net. Other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net decreased 21.6% in fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009 and decreased 48.7% in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008. Interest income was $8.1 million, $9.9 million and $17.5 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to decreased interest income of $1.8 million, partially offset by increased foreign currency transaction gains of $1.0 million. The decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for the year which decreased interest income by $7.6 million and decreased foreign currency transaction gains of $1.5 million. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a 36.4% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2010 compared to 30.5% in fiscal year 2009 and 37.1% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 is largely attributable to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at December 31, 2009 and a favorable adjustment related to equity awards in a major foreign tax jurisdiction which was reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009. At September 30, 2010, we did not have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $46.6 million, $57.0 million and $52.8 million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate. The federal credit for increasing research activities expired at December 31, 2009. If the credit is reinstated in fiscal year 2011, the reinstatement may have a material impact on our worldwide effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011. We have recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these potential exposures may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our future tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings of our securities. Years Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 862,066 $ 574,422 $ 451,272 Cash provided by operating activities 313,612 201,981 193,692 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (238,223 ) (99,109 ) 13,710 Cash used in financing activities (16,798 ) (70,706 ) (181,719 ) Cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments totaled $862.1 million as of September 30, 2010 compared to $574.4 million as of September 30, 2009, representing an increase of $287.6 million. The increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $313.6 million for fiscal year 2010, compared to $202.0 million for fiscal year 2009, which was partially offset by $75.0 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2010. In fiscal year 2009, the increase over the previous year was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $202.0 million, compared to $193.7 million for fiscal year 2008, which was 39 Table of Contents partially offset by $87.4 million of additional cash required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009. At September 30, 2010, we held $16.0 million in fair value of tax exempt ARS, which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rates being reset through Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28 or 35 days. The securities have historically traded at par and are callable at par at the option of the issuer. Interest is typically paid at the end of each auction period or semi annually. We limit our investments in ARS to securities that carry a AAA/A (or equivalent) rating from recognized rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At the time of initial investment and at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, all of our ARS were in compliance with our investment policy. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the security matures. We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS are presently at risk of default. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Through September 30, 2010, we have continued to receive interest payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities. However, due to uncertainty in the ARS market, we believe certain of these available for sale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified $19.0 million (par value) of our ARS as long term as of September 30, 2010. In October 2008, we entered into an agreement (the Agreement) with UBS whereby UBS would purchase eligible ARS it sold to us prior to February 13, 2008. Under the terms of the Agreement, and at our discretion, UBS will purchase eligible ARS from us at par value (put option) during the period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. Prior to September 30, 2010, UBS purchased all of the eligible ARS we held for their par value of $34.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2010 was $313.6 million compared to $202.0 million in fiscal year 2009 and $193.7 million in fiscal year 2008. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non cash charges such as stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in investing activities was $238.2 million for fiscal year 2010, compared to cash used in investing activities of $99.1 million for fiscal year 2009 and cash provided by investing activities of $13.7 million for fiscal year 2008. The cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2010 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. The cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. The cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments partially offset by the purchase of investments. Cash used in financing activities was $16.8 million for fiscal year 2010, compared to cash used in financing activities of $70.7 million for fiscal year 2009 and cash used in financing activities of $181.7 million for fiscal year 2008. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 included $75.0 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $31.7 million and tax benefits related to share based compensation of $26.5 million. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 included $87.4 million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 included $200 million to 40 Table of Contents repurchase common stock under a previous share repurchase program, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment balances, excluding ARS, together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements of existing products, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2010: Payment Obligations by Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Operating leases $ 16,661 $ 16,423 $ 15,439 $ 15,027 $ 14,409 $ 73,780 $ 151,739 Purchase obligations 14,302 14,302 Total $ 30,963 $ 16,423 $ 15,439 $ 15,027 $ 14,409 $ 73,780 $ 166,041 We lease our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2022. Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is given within applicable lead times. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810 10, Consolidation Overall (ASC 810 10), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We adopted ASC 810 10 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition) (ASU 2009 13) and ASU 2009 14, Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements, (amendments to FASB ASC Topic 985, Software) (ASU 2009 14). ASU 2009 13 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU 2009 14 removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The adoption of these statements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010 06). ASU 2010 06 increases disclosures to include transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 and clarifies inputs, valuation techniques and level of disaggregation to be disclosed. We adopted ASU 2010 06 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. The 41 Table of Contents adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio with the exception of U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in securities that mature in three years or less, with the average maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $4.8 million in our interest income for the fiscal year 2010. Maturing in Three Months Three Months Greater Than or Less to One Year One Year Total Fair Value (In thousands, except for percentages) September 30, 2010 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 26,987 $ $ $ 26,987 $ 26,987 Weighted average interest rate 0.1 % Included in short term investments $ 43,970 $ 215,772 $ $ 259,742 $ 259,742 Weighted average interest rates 1.4 % 1.6 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 433,570 $ 433,570 $ 433,570 Weighted average interest rates 1.4 % September 30, 2009 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 19,790 $ $ $ 19,790 $ 19,790 Weighted average interest rate 1.0 % Included in short term investments $ 59,981 $ 146,310 $ $ 206,291 $ 206,291 Weighted average interest rates 3.1 % 3.0 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 257,294 $ 257,294 $ 257,294 Weighted average interest rates 2.8 % September 30, 2008 Included in cash and cash equivalents $ 16,570 $ $ $ 16,570 $ 16,570 Weighted average interest rate 3.3 % Included in short term investments $ 28,019 $ 83,864 $ $ 111,883 $ 111,883 Weighted average interest rates 5.6 % 4.4 % Included in long term investments $ $ $ 261,086 $ 261,086 $ 261,086 Weighted average interest rates 4.6 % At September 30, 2010, the fair value of our AAA/A (or equivalent) rated municipal ARS was approximately $16.0 million. ARS are collateralized long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, typically every 7, 28 or 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $53.4 million in par value of municipal ARS we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. The underlying assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ARS will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our 42 Table of Contents liquidity needs. We have no intent to sell, wont be required to sell, and believe we will hold these securities until recovery. We believe certain of these available for sale investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months and as a result, we have classified $19.0 million (par value) of securities as long term as of September 30, 2010. Foreign Currency Risk. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 and expect to continue to do so, we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, as we continue to expand our operations internationally, transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future. 43
