Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information contained under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed as Exhibit 13.2 and included in Part IV, Item 14 of this report, is incorporated by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Based on analysis completed and described below, we do not believe that we are exposed to material market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Interest rates. We have unsecured revolving credit facilities that have variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus 100 basis points; therefore, we are exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations. This risk is somewhat mitigated by our ability to fix the base LIBOR rate for periods of up to six months. Accordingly, as of February 6, 2002, $15 million has been fixed at a base LIBOR rate of 2.0% through March 6, 2002, $35 million has been fixed at a base LIBOR rate of 1.9% through April 9, 2002, $20 million has been fixed at a base LIBOR rate of 1.9% through May 7, 2002, and $145 million has been fixed at a base LIBOR rate of 2.0% through July 8, 2002. We have performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis assuming a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR for the period subsequent to these dates and no additional reduction of debt levels. Based on this interest rate increase, interest expense would increase by approximately $1.1 million in 2002. Foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 19% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 40% of our assets at December 31, 2001 are associated with operations outside of the U.S. The U.S. dollar balance sheets and statements of income for these businesses are subject to currency fluctuations. We are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the Brazilian real and the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk, as it has not been cost effective. The impact of currency fluctuations on profitability has not been significant since both revenues and costs of these businesses are denominated in local currency. If the U.S. dollar had a 10% higher appreciation against our non U.S. dollar denominated businesses in 2001, revenues and operating income would have been reduced by $15.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We may use derivative financial instruments in the future if we deem it useful in mitigating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The cumulative translation adjustment, largely related to our investment in Unnisa, our Brazilian card processing operation, was a $67.6 million and $57.3 million reduction of shareholders equity at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
