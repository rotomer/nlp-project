Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are one of the largest global providers of processing services to financial institutions, with market leading positions in core processing, card issuing services, check risk management, mortgage processing, and certain other lender processing services in the U.S., serving customers in over 60 countries throughout the world. We offer a diversified product mix, and we believe that we will continue to benefit from the opportunity to cross sell products and services across our broad customer base, and from our expanded international presence and scale. We have two reporting segments, Transaction Processing Services and Lender Processing Services, which produced approximately 59% and 41%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Transaction Processing Services. This segment focuses on serving the processing and risk management needs of financial institutions and retailers. Our primary software applications function as the underlying infrastructure of a financial institutions processing environment. These applications include core bank processing software, which banks use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts. We also provide a number of complementary applications and services that interact directly with the core processing applications, including applications that facilitate interactions between our financial institution customers and their clients. We offer our applications and services through a range of delivery and service models, including on site outsourcing and remote processing arrangements, as well as on a licensed software basis for installation on customer owned and operated systems. This segment also includes card issuer services 24 Table of Contents which enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue VISA and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards, and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. In addition we provide check guarantee and verification services to retailers. Lender Processing Services. This segment offers core mortgage processing software, which banks use to process and service mortgage loans, as well as customized outsourced business processes and information solutions primarily to national lenders and loan servicers. These loan facilitation services consist primarily of centralized, customized title agency and closing services offered to first mortgage, refinance, home equity and sub prime lenders. In addition, this segment provides default management services to national lenders and loan servicers, allowing customers to outsource the business processes necessary to take a loan and the underlying real estate securing the loan through the default and foreclosure process. This segment also offers property data and real estate related services. Included in these services are appraisal and valuation services, property records information, real estate tax services, and borrower credit and flood zone information. We also have a corporate segment that consists primarily of costs relating to corporate overhead. Business Trends and Conditions Transaction Processing Services In the transaction processing services business, increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth. In this segment, we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process in house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi year recurring revenue streams. Generally, financial institutions of all sizes will consider outsourcing information technology and business process services to varying degrees, although smaller financial institutions are more likely to outsource all information technology functions to companies such as us since they generally do not have the staff, budget or expertise to implement and operate highly complex technical environments. Larger financial institutions have historically chosen to limit outsourcing to specific application functions or services in connection with a particular product or operation. Generally, demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card related products. We continue to launch new products aimed at serving this demand. In recent years, we have introduced a variety of stored value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment products, as well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. We may be affected by the consolidation trend in the banking industry. This trend may be beneficial or detrimental to the Transaction Processing Services businesses. When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Lender Processing Services Our mortgage processing services business, driven by MSP, is largely subject to the same types of factors as affect our financial institutions core processing business, described above. The level of residential real estate activity, which depends in part on the level of interest rates, affects the level of revenues from many of the other businesses in the Lender Processing Services segment. 25 Table of Contents The increase in interest rates in 2006 has resulted in a reduction in new loan origination and refinancing activity. The current MBA forecast is for $2.4 trillion of mortgage originations in 2007 as compared to $2.5 trillion in 2006. Relatively higher interest rates are also likely to result in seasonal effects having more influence on real estate activity. Traditionally, the greatest volume of real estate activity, particularly residential resale transactions, has occurred in the spring and summer months. In contrast, we believe that a rising interest rate environment may increase the volume of consumer mortgage defaults and thus favorably affect our default management services, which provide services relating to residential mortgage loans in default. The overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The following describes our primary types of revenues and our revenue recognition policies as they pertain to the types of transactions we enter into with our customers. We enter into arrangements with customers to provide services, software and software related services such as post contract customer support and implementation and training either individually or as part of an integrated offering of multiple products and services. These products and services occasionally include offerings from more than one segment to the same customer. The revenues for services provided under these multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition accounting principles as further described below. In our TPS business, we recognize revenues relating to bank processing and credit and debit card processing services along with software licensing and software related services. Several of our contracts include a software license and one or more of the following services: data processing, development, implementation, conversion, training, programming, post contract customer support and application management. In some cases, these services are offered in combination with one another and in other cases we offer them individually. Revenues from processing services are typically volume based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions processed and computer resources utilized. The substantial majority of the revenues in the transaction processing services business are from outsourced data processing, credit and debit card processing, and application management arrangements. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized as services are performed in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB No. 104), Revenue Recognition and related interpretations. SAB No. 104 sets forth guidance as to when revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the sellers price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues and costs related to implementation, conversion and programming services associated with our data processing and application management agreements during the implementation phase are deferred and subsequently recognized using the straight line method over the term of the related services agreement. We evaluate these deferred contract costs for impairment in the event any indications of impairment exist. A portion of credit card processing revenue is generated from our merchant institution processing business, where our relationship is with the financial institution that contracts directly with the merchant. In this business, we are responsible for collecting and settling interchange fees with the credit card associations, thus interchange fees are included as a component of revenue and costs of revenue. In the event that arrangements with our customers include more than one product or service, we determine whether the individual revenue elements can be recognized separately in accordance with Financial Accounting 26 Table of Contents Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 21 (EITF 00 21), Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00 21 addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. If the products and services are software related products and services as determined under AICPAs SOP 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), and SOP 98 9 Modification of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions (SOP 98 9) we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units. We recognize software license and post contract customer support fees as well as associated development, implementation, training, conversion and programming fees in accordance with SOP No. 97 2 and SOP No. 98 9. Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable, provided that vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) has been established for each element or for any undelivered elements. We determine the fair value of each element or the undelivered elements in multi element software arrangements based on VSOE. If the arrangement is subject to accounting under SOP No. 97 2, VSOE for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately, or in the case of post contract customer support, when a stated renewal rate is provided to the customer. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a contract, then all revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered or fair value is determined for all remaining undelivered elements. Revenue from post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. We record deferred revenue for all billings invoiced prior to revenue recognition. With respect to a small percentage of revenues, we use contract accounting, as required by SOP No. 97 2, when the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization, modification, or production of software. For elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is recognized in accordance with SOP 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, using the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made. Revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are recorded as unbilled receivables and are included in trade receivables. Billings in excess of revenue recognized on these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met. Changes in estimates for revenues, costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable. When our estimates indicate that the entire contract will be performed at a loss, a provision for the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period. In our LPS business, we recognize revenues relating to mortgage processing services, loan facilitation services, default management services, and property data related services. Mortgage processing arrangements are typically volume based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions processed and computer resources utilized. Revenue derived from software and service arrangements included in the lender processing services segment is recognized in accordance with SOP No. 97 2 as discussed above. Loan facilitation services primarily consist of centralized title agency and closing services for various types of lenders. Revenues relating to loan facilitation services are typically recognized at the time of closing of the related real estate transaction. Ancillary service fees are recognized when the service is provided. Default management services assist customers through the default and foreclosure process, including property preservation and maintenance services (such as lock changes, window replacement, debris removal and lawn service), posting and publication of foreclosure and auction notices, title searches, document preparation and recording services, and referrals for legal and property brokerage services. Property data or data related services principally include appraisal and valuation services, property records information, real estate tax services, borrower credit and flood zone information and multiple listing software and services. Revenues derived from these services are recognized as the services are performed in accordance with SAB No. 104 as described above. 27 Table of Contents In addition, our flood and tax units provide various services including life of loan monitoring services. Revenue for life of loan services is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated average life of the loan service period, which is determined based on our historical experience and industry data. We evaluate our historical experience on a periodic basis, and adjust the estimated life of the loan service period prospectively. Reserves for Card Processing and Check Guarantee Losses We recognize a reserve for estimated losses related to our card issuing business based on historical experience and other relevant factors. In our card issuing business, we record estimates to accrue for losses resulting from transaction processing errors. We utilize a number of systems and procedures within our card issuing business in order to minimize such transaction processing errors. Card processing loss reserves are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our loss experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy and the credit quality of customers. Once these factors are considered, we assess the reserve adequacy by comparing the recorded reserve to the estimated amount based on an analysis of the current trend changes or specific anticipated future events. Any adjustments are charged to costs of services. These card processing loss reserve amounts are subject to risk that actual losses may be different than our estimates. In the check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writers bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the checks face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of the check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, a rate is established for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to cost of revenue. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different from our estimates. Computer Software Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. Capitalized software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (SFAS No. 86), or with SOP No. 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. After the technological feasibility of the software has been established (for SFAS No. 86 software), or at the beginning of application development (for SOP No. 98 1 software), software development costs, which include salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility (for SFAS No. 86 software), or prior to application development (for SOP No. 98 1 software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products (for SFAS No. 86 software) and the date placed in service for purchased software (for SOP No. 98 1 software). Software development costs (for SFAS No. 86 software) are amortized using the greater of (1) the straight line method over its estimated useful life, which ranges from five to ten years or (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions. These assets consist of purchased customer relationships, contracts, and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). The determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the intangible assets require significant judgment and may affect the amount of future amortization on the intangible assets other than goodwill. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, goodwill was $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The process of determining whether or not an asset, such as goodwill, is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows, operating results and market conditions. Such projections are inherently uncertain and, accordingly, actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future net cash flows generated by the reporting units underlying assets. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units as of December 31, 2006 and determined that each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of its carrying value. Accordingly, no goodwill impairment has been recorded. Such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in estimates of future net cash flows and discount rates. Changes to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair value of the reporting units and determination of the recoverability of goodwill which may result in charges against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, intangible assets were $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion respectively, which consist primarily of purchased customer relationships and trademarks. The valuation of these assets involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as customer retention, future cash flows and discount rates. If any of these assumptions change, it could affect the carrying value of these assets. Purchased customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates over a ten year period. All trademarks have been determined to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with SFAS No. 142. During 2005, we recorded an impairment of $9.3 million to write off the carrying value of customer relationships at one subsidiary in the Lender Processing Services segment which were terminated. Long Lived Assets We review long lived assets, primarily computer software, property and equipment and other intangibles, such as customer relationships and contracts, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, we estimate the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of those assets and their eventual disposal. We would recognize an impairment loss if the aggregate future net cash flows were less than the carrying amount. As a result, the carrying values of these assets could be significantly affected by the accuracy of the estimates of future net cash flows, which are not capable of being made with certainty. Accounting for Income Taxes Through March 9, 2005, our operating results have been included in Old FNFs consolidated U.S. Federal and certain consolidated and or combined State income tax returns. The provision for income taxes in the Consolidated and Combined statements of earnings is made at rates consistent with what we would have provided for as a stand alone taxable entity. Subsequent to the recapitalization transaction and sale of minority interest, we became a stand alone taxpayer. As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated and Combined financial statements, we were required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we established a valuation allowance or increased this 29 Table of Contents allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. Derivatives and Hedging We utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure on our variable rate debt obligations. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended. All relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items are documented at the inception of the hedge transaction, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. We carry the fair value of the interest rate swaps as an asset or a liability on the balance sheet at each reporting date, with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive earnings within stockholders equity. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive earnings to the income statement in the periods that the hedged transaction affects earnings. A formal assessment is performed at the hedges inception and on a regular basis thereafter to determine whether the hedge has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged transaction and whether it is expected to be highly effective in the future. Our existing cash flow hedges have been highly effective and there has been no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the estimated fair value of cash flow hedges results in an asset of $4.9 million and $5.2 million, which is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets with a corresponding amount recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. Related Party Transactions Transactions with FNF We have historically conducted business with Old FNF and its subsidiaries. In March 2005, in connection with the recapitalization and sale of equity interest, we entered into various agreements with Old FNF under which we continued to provide title agency services, title plant management, and IT services. Further, we also entered into service agreements with Old FNF under which Old FNF continued to provide us with corporate services. In September 2005, when Fidelity National Title Group, Inc. (FNT) was formed and the title insurance business was consolidated under FNT, many of these agreements were amended and restated to take into account the services that would be performed for and by FNT rather than Old FNF. On February 1, 2006, in connection with the closing of the Certegy Merger, many of these agreements were further amended and restated to reflect certain changes in the parties relationships. Certain of these agreements were amended or terminated in connection with the FNF merger and related transactions, as described in our current report on Form 8 K filed with the SEC on October 27, 2006. A summary of these agreements as in effect through December 31, 2006 is as follows: Agreement to provide data processing services. This agreement governs the revenues to be earned by us for providing IT support services and software, primarily infrastructure support and data center management, to FNF. Subject to certain early termination provisions (including the payment of minimum monthly service and termination fees), this agreement has an initial term of five years from February 2006 with an option to renew for one or two additional years. Agreements to provide title plant information, maintenance and management. These agreements govern the fee structure under which we are paid for maintaining, managing and updating title plants owned by FNFs title underwriters in certain parts of the country. The title plant maintenance agreement requires, among other things, that we gather updated property information, organize it, input it into one of several systems, maintain or obtain the use of necessary software and hardware to store, access and deliver the data, sell and deliver the data to customers and provide various forms of customer support. We sell property information to title underwriters which are subsidiaries of FNF as well as to various unaffiliated customers. We pay FNF a royalty fee of 2.5% to 3.75% of the revenues received. In the case of the maintenance agreement, we are responsible for the costs of keeping the title plant assets current and functioning and in 30 Table of Contents return receive the revenue generated by those assets. Subject to certain early termination provisions for cause, each of these agreements may be terminated upon five years prior written notice, which notice may not be given until after the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement in May 2005 (thus effectively resulting in a minimum ten year term and a rolling one year term thereafter). Agreements to provide software development and services. These agreements govern the fee structure under which we are paid for providing software development and services to FNF which consist of developing software for use in the title operations of FNF. Arrangements to provide other real estate related services. Under these arrangements we are paid for providing other real estate related services to FNF, which consist primarily of data services required by the title insurance operations. Agreements by FNF to provide corporate services to us. These agreements provide for FNF to provide general management, accounting, treasury, tax, finance, legal, payroll, human resources, employee benefits, internal audit, mergers and acquisitions, and other corporate and administrative support FIS. The pricing of these services is at cost for services which are either directly attributable to us, or in certain circumstances, an allocation of our share of the total costs incurred by FNF in providing such services based on estimates that FNF and FIS believe to be reasonable. Licensing, leasing and cost sharing agreements. These agreements provide for the reimbursement of certain amounts from FNF or its subsidiaries related to various miscellaneous licensing, leasing, and cost sharing agreements, as well as the payment of certain amounts by us to FNF (or their subsidiaries) in connection with our use of certain intellectual property or other assets of or services by FNF. Agreements to provide title agency services. These agreements allow us to provide services to existing customers through loan facilitation transactions, primarily with large national lenders. The arrangement involves FIS providing title agency services which result in the issuance of title policies by FIS on behalf of title insurance underwriters owned by FNF and subsidiaries. Subject to certain early termination provisions for cause, each of these agreements may be terminated upon five years prior written notice, which notice may not be given until after the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement ranging from July 2004 through September 2006 for various agreements (thus effectively resulting in a minimum ten year term and a rolling one year term thereafter). The LPS segment includes revenues from unaffiliated third parties of $83.9 million, $80.9 million and $92.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing commissions on title insurance policies written by us on behalf of title insurance subsidiaries of FNF. These commissions are equal to 88% of the total title premium from title policies that we place with subsidiaries of FNF. We also perform similar functions in connection with trustee sale guarantees, a form of title insurance that subsidiaries of FNF issue as part of the foreclosure process on a defaulted loan. A detail of related party items included in revenues is as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Data processing services revenue $ 82.2 $ 56.9 $ 56.6 Title plant information revenue 41.4 31.1 28.9 Software revenue 25.9 18.9 5.8 Other real estate related services 12.7 10.9 9.9 Total revenues $ 162.2 $ 117.8 $ 101.2 31 Table of Contents A detail of related party items included in operating expenses is as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Title plant royalty expense $ 2.4 $ 3.0 $ 2.8 Rent expense 5.0 8.4 Corporate services 9.5 29.0 75.1 Licensing, leasing and cost sharing agreement (12.9 ) (15.7 ) (15.6 ) Total expenses $ (1.0 ) $ 21.3 $ 70.7 We believe the amounts earned from or charged by FNF to us under each of the foregoing service arrangements are fair and reasonable. Although the 88% commission rate on title insurance policies was set without negotiation, we believe it is consistent with the blended rate that would be available to a third party title agent given the amount and the geographic distribution of the business produced and the low risk of loss profile of the business placed. In connection with title plant management, we charge FNF title insurers for title information at approximately the same rates we and other similar vendors charge unaffiliated title insurers. Our IT infrastructure support and data center management services to FNF are priced within the range of prices we offer to third parties. We also provide data processing services to Sedgwick CMS, a company in which FNF has held an approximately 40% equity interest since February 1, 2006. We recorded $17.3 million in revenue relating to this arrangement with Sedgwick in 2006. Other transactions with FNF: Contribution of National New York During the second quarter of 2006, Old FNF contributed the stock of National Title Insurance of New York, Inc. (National New York), a title insurance company, to us, in connection with the recapitalization transaction in March 2005. This transaction was reflected as a contribution of capital from Old FNF in the amount of Old FNFs historical basis in National New York of approximately $10.7 million. Merger with FNF Capital On October 26, 2006, we completed a merger with FNF Capital, Inc. (FNF Capital) a leasing subsidiary of Old FNF. We issued 279,000 shares of our common stock to Old FNF in exchange for a majority ownership in FNF Capital. The transaction was recorded at Old FNFs historical basis in FNF Capital of approximately $2.3 million and we purchased the minority ownership shortly thereafter for $3.8 million in cash. The contribution of National New York and the merger with FNF Capital were completed between entities under common control and their results of operations and account balances have been included in our results of operations and statement of financial position since the date of the relevant transactions. Had we included the results of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented in our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, net earnings would have been adjusted by $0.5 million, ($0.2) million and ($0.7) million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and total assets would have increased $82.2 million as of December 31, 2005. Investment by FNF in Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions, Inc. On December 31, 2006, FNF contributed $52.5 million to Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions, Inc.(FNRES), our subsidiary, for approximately 61% of the outstanding shares of FNRES. As a result, as of December 31, 2006, we no longer consolidate FNRES, but record our remaining 39% interest as an equity investment in the amount of $33.5 million. The results of FNRES are included in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. Transactions with Covansys In 2004, we entered into a master service provider agreement with Covansys, an entity in which we hold a 29% equity interest, which requires that we purchase a minimum of $150 million in services over a five year period expiring June 30, 2009 or be subject to certain penalties if defined spending thresholds are not met. We do not believe any future penalties will be incurred under the agreement. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we spent $35.7 million, $17.6 million and $5.0 million purchasing professional services from Covansys and its subsidiaries. 32 Table of Contents Transactions with Banco Bradesco S.A. and ABN AMRO Real In 2006, we recorded revenues of $22.8 million from ABN AMRO Real and $20.4 million from Banco Bradesco S.A., which are venture partners in our Brazilian Card business. Recent Developments Combination with Old FNF On June 25, 2006, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the FNF Merger Agreement) with Old FNF (amended September 18, 2006) (the FNF Merger). This FNF Merger was one step in a plan that eliminated Old FNFs holding company structure and majority ownership in FIS. In connection with this plan, Old FNF also entered into a securities exchange and distribution agreement (the SEDA) with its subsidiary FNT. Under the SEDA, Old FNF agreed that, prior to the merger, Old FNF would transfer substantially all its assets and liabilities to FNT, in exchange for shares of FNT common stock. Old FNF then would spin off all shares of FNT stock it held to the stockholders of Old FNF in a tax free distribution. Pursuant to the FNF Merger Agreement, on November 9, 2006 Old FNF merged with and into FIS, with FIS continuing as the surviving corporation. In consideration for the FNF Merger, Old FNF stockholders received an aggregate of 96,521,877 shares of our stock for their Old FNF shares. In addition, in connection with the FNF Merger we issued options to purchase our common stock and shares of our restricted stock in exchange for Old FNF options and restricted stock outstanding at the time of the FNF Merger. After the completion of all of the transactions, FNT was renamed Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF) and trades under the symbol FNF. Former Old FNF Chairman and CEO William P. Foley, II, assumed the same position in FNF and now serves as Executive Chairman of FIS, and other key members of Old FNF senior management continue their involvement in both FNF and FIS in executive capacities. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that one of the two parties to the FNF Merger be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. However, Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin 85 5, Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations provides that if a transaction lacks substance, it is not a purchase event and should be accounted for based on existing carrying amounts. In the FNF Merger, the minority interest in FIS has not changed and, in substance, the only assets and liabilities of the combined entity after the exchange are those of FIS prior to the exchange. Because a change in ownership of the minority interest has not taken place, the exchange has been accounted for based on the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities. Factors Affecting Comparability Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions: On February 1, 2006, Former FIS merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Certegy. The transaction resulted in a reverse acquisition with a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. Certegy provided credit card, debit card, and other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and internationally through two segments, Card Services and Check Services. On March 9, 2005, our recapitalization was completed through $2.8 billion in borrowings under senior credit facilities consisting of an $800 million Term Loan A facility, a $2.0 billion Term Loan B facility (collectively, the Term Loan Facilities) and a $400 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver). We fully drew upon the entire $2.8 billion in Term Loan Facilities to complete the recapitalization while the Revolver remained undrawn at the closing. At the same time, we also sold a 25 percent equity interest to an investment group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL) and Texas Pacific Group (TPG). During 2004, we acquired Aurum Technology (Aurum), Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. (Sanchez), Kordoba and InterCept Inc. (InterCept) which added significant revenues to our TPS segment. The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements present the results of operations of Certegy, the effects of the recapitalization and results of operations of the 2004 acquisitions, in each case, effective as of the date of the 33 Table of Contents acquisition or recapitalization. As a result of these transactions, the results of operations in the periods covered by the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements may not be directly comparable. Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 2004 Processing and services revenues $ 4,132,602 $ 2,766,085 $ 2,331,527 Cost of revenues 2,929,567 1,793,285 1,525,174 Gross profit 1,203,035 972,800 806,353 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 505,528 422,623 432,310 Research and development costs 105,580 113,498 74,214 Operating income 591,927 436,679 299,829 Other income (expense): Interest income 4,746 6,392 1,232 Interest expense (192,819 ) (126,778 ) (4,496 ) Other income (expense) (224 ) (4,237 ) 18,175 Total other income (expense) (188,297 ) (124,623 ) 14,911 Earnings before income taxes, equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities and minority interest 403,630 312,056 314,740 Provision for income taxes 150,150 116,085 118,343 Earnings before equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities and minority interest 253,480 195,971 196,397 Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities 5,792 5,029 (3,308 ) Minority interest (185 ) (4,450 ) (3,673 ) Net earnings $ 259,087 $ 196,550 $ 189,416 Pro forma net earnings per share basic $ 1.39 $ 1.54 $ 1.48 Pro forma weighted average shares outstanding basic 185,926 127,920 127,920 Pro forma net earnings per share diluted $ 1.37 $ 1.53 $ 1.48 Pro forma weighted average shares outstanding diluted 189,196 128,354 127,920 Processing and Services Revenues Processing and services revenues totaled $4,132.6 million, $2,766.1 million and $2,331.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in revenue in 2006 of $1,366.5 million as compared to 2005 is primarily due to incremental revenues from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, which contributed $1,067.2 million to the overall increase. The remaining 2006 increase is attributable to growth across both segments, including 15.2% growth in Transaction Processing Services, excluding the impact of Certegy, and 7.5% growth in Lender Processing Services. The growth in Transaction Processing Services was driven by strong new sales within Integrated Financial Solutions and International, while the growth in Lender Processing Services was driven by market share gains in default and appraisal services. The increase in revenue in 2005 of $434.6 million as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to an increase of $316.4 million, or 35.5%, from our Transaction Processing Services segment which is the result of including a full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Kordoba, and InterCept which contributed $301.1 million of the increase. The remaining 2005 increase is primarily due to organic growth across the company. 34 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues totaled $2,929.6 million, $1,793.3 million and $1,525.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. The increase in cost of revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 of $1,136.3 million was primarily due to incremental cost of revenues from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the overall increase. An increase in depreciation and amortization expense to $383.0 million in 2006 from $252.5 million in 2005 resulting from additional intangible amortization related to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the year over year increase. The increase in cost of revenues of $268.1 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to including a full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Kordoba, and InterCept including the amortization of intangibles related to each acquisition. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 29.1%, 35.2% and 34.6% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, which businesses typically have lower margins than those of the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental intangible amortization expense relating to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the decrease in gross margin in 2006. The increase in gross margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from the full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $505.5 million, $422.6 million and $432.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase of $82.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to incremental selling, general and administrative expenses from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which contributed $73.7 million to the overall increase. Additionally, the increase was also due to an increase in stock based compensation expense which increased from $20.4 million during 2005 to $50.1 million for 2006. This increase in stock based compensation is primarily attributable to the $24.5 million in expense recorded for the vesting of the FIS performance based options granted in March 2005 for which the performance criteria was met during the first quarter of 2006 and an acceleration charge of $6.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the FNF Merger. The decrease of $9.7 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily results from cost control measures implemented in 2005 related to the 2004 acquisitions. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are $50.5 million, $47.1 million, and $40.5 million in depreciation and amortization costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs totaled $105.6 million, $113.5 million and $74.2 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase of $39.3 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 reflects an increase in research and development activity surrounding the acquired technology assets associated with the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Bankware, Kordoba, and InterCept. Operating Income Operating income totaled $591.9 million, $436.7 million and $299.8 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) was 14.3%, 15.8% and 12.9% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The year over year decrease in operating margin for 2006 is primarily due to incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger, increased stock based compensation costs, other merger related costs, as well as relatively lower gross profit percentage associated with the Certegy product lines, as noted above. The increase in operating margin for 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the higher revenues associated with 2004 acquisitions, for which there was a full year of results in 2005. The addition of these acquisitions resulted in a higher revenue base for spreading more stable administrative costs. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $192.8 million, $126.8 million and $4.5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to an increase in interest rates and 35 Table of Contents higher average borrowings. Additionally, the recapitalization that occurred late in the first quarter of 2005 resulted in a full year of interest in 2006 as compared to approximately ten months in 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 also resulted from the recapitalization in 2005. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense totaled $150.2 million, $116.1 million and $118.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.2%, 37.2% and 37.6% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net Earnings Net earnings totaled $259.1 million, $196.6 and $189.4 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, or $1.37, $1.53 and $1.48 per diluted share, respectively. Segment Results of Operations Transaction Processing Services (in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Processing and services revenues $ 2,458,777 $ 1,208,430 $ 892,033 Cost of revenues 1,914,148 904,124 667,078 Gross profit 544,629 304,306 224,955 Selling, general and administrative expenses 171,106 94,889 99,581 Research and development costs 70,879 85,702 54,038 Operating income $ 302,644 $ 123,715 $ 71,336 Revenues for the Transaction Processing Services segment are derived from three main revenue channels; Enterprise Solutions, Integrated Financial Solutions and International. Revenues from Transaction Processing Services totaled $2,458.8 million, $1,208.4 and $892.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The overall segment increase of $1,250.4 million during 2006, as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed $1,067.2 million to the overall increase. The majority of the remaining 2006 growth is attributable to organic growth within the historically owned Integrated Financial Solutions and International revenue channels, with International including $31.9 million related to the newly formed business process outsourcing operation in Brazil. The overall segment increase of $316.4 in 2005 as compared to 2004 results from the inclusion of a full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Kordoba, and InterCept, which contributed $301.1 million of the increase. Cost of revenues for the Transaction Processing Services segment totaled $1,914.1 million, $904.1 million and $667.1 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The overall segment increase of $1,010.0 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the increase. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 22.2%, 25.2% and 25.2% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, which businesses typically have lower margins than those of the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the decrease in gross margin. Included in cost of revenues was depreciation and amortization of $272.4 million, $139.8 million, and $94.6 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $171.1 million, $94.9 million and $99.6 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed $73.7 million to the overall increase of $76.2 million. The decrease of $4.7 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the effect of acquisition related costs in 2004. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses was depreciation and amortization of $11.0 million, $9.1 million and $2.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Research and development costs totaled $70.9 million, $85.7 million and $54.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase of $31.7 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 reflects an increase in research and development activity surrounding the acquired technology assets associated with the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Bankware, Kordoba, and Intercept. Operating income totaled $302.6 million, $123.7 million and $71.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 12.3%, 10.2% and 8.0% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in operating margin for 2006 as compared to 2005 resulted from a decrease, as a percentage of revenue, of 0.9% in selling, general and administrative expenses and 4.2% in research and development costs, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin as discussed above. The increase in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily results from the relative stability of selling, general and administrative expenses against a larger revenue base due to the inclusion of a full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions. Lender Processing Services (in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Processing and services revenues $ 1,678,606 $ 1,562,161 $ 1,445,008 Cost of revenues 1,015,419 889,161 858,186 Gross profit 663,187 673,000 586,822 Selling, general and administrative expenses 208,698 234,655 261,045 Research and development costs 34,701 27,796 20,176 Operating income $ 419,788 $ 410,549 $ 305,601 Revenues for the Lender Processing Services segment totaled $1,678.6 million, $1,562.2 million and $1,445.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The overall segment increase of $116.4 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 was the result of growth across most of the business lines, but primarily due to increased demand for our appraisal services along with growth in our default management businesses. Cost of revenues for the Lender Processing Services segment totaled $1,015.4 million, $889.2 million and $858.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross margin was 39.5%, 43.1% and 40.6% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to growth in lower margin product lines including default and appraisal services along with declining margins in our tax services due to the lengthening of the service period. Included in cost of revenues was depreciation and amortization of $110.6 million, $112.8 million and $103.3 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Lender Processing Services segment totaled $208.7 million, $234.7 million and $261.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decreasing trend is primarily the result of cost control measures and the increased revenue base in the Transaction Processing Services segment for allocating certain combined selling and administrative expenses. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses was depreciation and amortization of $29.2 million, $31.8 million, and $35.1 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Research and development costs for the Lender Processing Services segment totaled $34.7 million, $27.8 million, and $20.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increasing trend relates primarily to additional activities surrounding our mortgage processing and loan origination software lines. Operating income for the Lender Processing Services segment totaled $419.8 million, $410.5 million, and $305.6 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating margin was 25.0%, 26.3% and 21.1% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Corporate and Other Selling, general and administrative expenses from the Corporate and Other segment consist of corporate overhead costs that have been allocated from FNF prior to the merger with FNF and other amounts incurred directly 37 Table of Contents by FIS, including stock based compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $125.7 million, $93.1 million and $71.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 of $32.6 million primarily relates to an increase in stock based compensation expense which increased from $20.4 million in 2005 to $50.1 million in 2006, as well as an increase in merger and merger related integration costs. The increase in stock based compensation primarily related to the $24.5 million in expense recorded in the first quarter of 2006 for the vesting of the FIS performance based options granted in March of 2005 for which the performance criteria were met during 2006 and a $6.1 million charge related to the acceleration of vesting of stock options recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the FNF merger. Pro forma Segment Information Summarized pro forma financial information for 2006 and 2005 concerning the Companys reportable segments is shown in the following tables. The results below have been adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect a January 1, 2005, effective date for the Certegy Merger, purchase of minority interests of Kordoba, and the March 2005 recapitalization and sale of minority interests by FIS. For the year ended December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Transaction Lender Processing Processing Corporate Services Services and Other Total Processing and services revenues $ 2,549,740 $ 1,678,606 $ (2,829 ) $ 4,225,517 Cost of revenues 1,994,222 1,015,419 3,009,641 Gross profit 555,518 663,187 (2,829 ) 1,215,876 Selling, general and administrative expenses 175,516 208,698 208,204 592,418 Research and development costs 70,879 34,701 105,580 Operating income $ 309,123 $ 419,788 $ (211,033 ) $ 517,878 For the year ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Transaction Lender Processing Processing Corporate Services Services and Other Total Processing and services revenues $ 2,325,571 $ 1,562,161 $ (4,506 ) $ 3,883,226 Cost of revenues 1,778,630 889,161 2,667,791 Gross profit 546,941 673,000 (4,506 ) 1,215,435 Selling, general and administrative expenses 186,098 234,655 126,074 546,827 Research and development costs 85,702 27,796 113,498 Operating income $ 275,141 $ 410,549 $ (130,580 ) $ 555,110 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings. At December 31, 2006, we have cash on hand of $211.8 million and long term debt including the current portion of approximately $3.0 billion. We expect cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt absent any unusual circumstances such as acquisitions or adverse changes in the business environment. 38 Table of Contents We currently pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders of $0.05 per share and expect to continue to do so in the future, although the payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to any limits in our debt or other agreements. We intend to limit dilution caused by option exercises, including anticipated exercises, by repurchasing shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2006, we repurchased 4,261,200 shares at an average price of $37.60 under this program. On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases up to an additional $200 million worth of our common stock. Capital Expenditures Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software and additions to property and equipment. In 2006, we spent approximately $300.2 million on capital expenditures and in 2007, we expect to spend approximately $300 million, primarily on equipment, purchased software and internally developed software. Financing On March 9, 2005, FIS completed a recapitalization. FIS entered into $3.2 billion in senior credit facilities consisting of an $800 million Term Loan A facility, a $2.0 billion Term Loan B facility (collectively, the Term Loan Facilities) and a $400 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver) with a consortium of lenders led by Bank of America. FIS fully drew upon the entire $2.8 billion in Term Loan Facilities to consummate the recapitalization. FIS used proceeds from the loans to repay the outstanding principal and interest on a $2.7 billion note it previously issued as a dividend to FNF. Revolving credit borrowings and Term A and B Loans bore interest at a floating rate and as a result of scheduled and other repayments, the aggregate principal balance of the Term Loan Facilities at December 31, 2006 was $2.5 billion. These credit facilities were paid in full as a result of the refinancing transaction completed on January 18, 2007 as described below. FIS used proceeds from the Term Loans to repay all outstanding principal and interest on a $2.7 billion principal amount promissory note that it distributed to FNF as a dividend on March 8, 2005. On March 9, 2005, FIS also completed its minority interest sale, in which it issued common shares representing a 25% interest in FIS to an investor group for $500 million. FIS used the proceeds of that issuance and the remaining Term Loan proceeds to retire its former revolving credit facility and pay expenses relating to the recapitalization and the minority interest sale. These expenses totaled $79.2 million, and included certain fees and expenses of the investor group totaling approximately $45.7 million. The remaining proceeds from the Term Loans and minority interest sale were retained to use for general corporate purposes. On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and L/C Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party thereto (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement replaces the Bank of America Term Loan and Revolver as well as the $100 million Wachovia Settlement Facility. The Credit Agreement, which is unsecured, provides for a committed $2.1 billion five year term facility denominated in U.S. Dollars (the JPM Term Loan) and a committed $900 million revolving credit facility (the JPM Revolving Loan) with a sublimit of $250 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (the Maturity Date). The JPM Revolving Loan is bifurcated into a $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan (the Multicurrency Tranche) that can be denominated in any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant lenders agree to make advances and a $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under the Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the uncommitted maximum principal amount of $600 million, which will be made available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the amount requested by FIS. The JPM Term Loan was fully drawn on the closing date and a total of $557 million was borrowed under the JPM Revolving Loan on the closing date. The obligations under the Credit Agreement have been jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company. 39 Table of Contents FIS may borrow, repay and re borrow amounts under the JPM Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the JPM Revolving Loan. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under the JPM Term Loan in scheduled installments of: (a) $13,125,000 per quarter from March 31, 2007 through December 31, 2008; (b) $26,250,000 per quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009; and (c) $52,500,000 per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of approximately $1,522,500,000 payable on the Maturity Date. In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the JPM Term Loan is (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and sales of assets. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans are generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment reductions of the JPM Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice. The JPM Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. The outstanding balance of the Loans bear interest at a floating rate, which is at our option, either (a) the eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin and mandatory cost or (b) a base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a leverage ratio (total indebtedness to EBITDA of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit Agreement). Alternatively, the Company has the ability to request the lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances under the JPM Revolving Loan (Bid Rate Advances). The Credit Agreement provides procedures for lenders to submit bids for Bid Rate Advances and for the Company to accept or reject them. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the loan. Events of default include conditions customary for such an agreement, including failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants. The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement and reference is made to the complete text of the agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Form 8 K dated January 19, 2007. In connection with the new Credit Agreement, the Company terminated the Bank of America Term Loan and Revolver on January 18, 2007 and repaid it in full before its final scheduled expiration date of March 9, 2013. The final payment was approximately $2.64 billion, including principal, interest and fees. The Company incurred no early termination penalties in terminating the Bank of America credit agreement. In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company has an obligation to service $200 million (aggregate principal amount) of unsecured 4.75% fixed rate notes due in September 2008. The notes were recorded in purchase accounting at a discount of $5.7 million, which is being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the notes. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on each March 15 and September 15. The Company had a $100 million unsecured revolving credit facility that it used to finance its customers shortfalls in the daily funding requirements associated with the Companys credit and debit card settlement operations (Settlement Facility). Amounts borrowed were typically repaid within one to two business days, as customers funded the shortfalls. This facility had a term of 364 days and was renewed annually. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006. The Settlement Facility was terminated on January 18, 2007. Contractual Obligations FISs long term contractual obligations generally include its long term debt and operating lease payments on certain of its property and equipment. The following table summarizes FISs significant contractual obligations and 40 Table of Contents commitments as of December 31, 2006, after giving effect to the debt refinancing completed on January 18, 2007 (in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long term debt (note 13) $ 96,161 $ 282,041 $ 145,129 $ 215,586 $ 165,455 $ 2,105,129 $ 3,009,501 Operating leases (note 15) 50,687 42,785 33,609 21,479 10,616 16,543 175,719 Investment commitment 22,300 44,800 67,100 Purchase commitments 60,000 25,000 85,000 Data processing agreement obligations (note 15) 37,538 45,733 49,171 50,951 50,721 284,993 519,107 Total $ 266,686 $ 440,359 $ 227,909 $ 288,016 $ 226,792 $ 2,406,665 $ 3,856,427 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements FIS does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements, other than the Wisconsin operating leases disclosed below and in Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The Company has a synthetic lease arrangement (the Wisconsin Lease) which is not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheets with respect to its facilities in Madison, Wisconsin (the Wisconsin Leased Property). In connection with the Certegy Merger, the term of the Wisconsin Lease was amended so that it was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2006. The term of the Wisconsin Lease has since been further amended so that it now expires on June 30, 2007. The original cost to the lessor of the Wisconsin Leased Property when Certegy entered into the Wisconsin Lease was approximately $10.1 million. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company has the option to acquire the Wisconsin Leased Property at its original cost, or to direct the sale of the Wisconsin Leased Property to a third party. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires entities to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Entities are required to recognize actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, when recognizing a plans funded status, with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income. SFAS 158 will not change the amounts recognized in the income statement as net periodic benefit cost. All of the requirements of SFAS 158 are effective as of December 31, 2006 for calendar year public companies, except for a requirement for fiscal year end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations with which the Company is already in compliance. Adoption of this standard resulted in the Company recording a $6.9 million pre tax adjustment to other long term liabilities and other comprehensive income. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (Topic 1N), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). This SAB addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect of initial adoption is determined to be material, the SAB allows registrants to record that effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. Adoption of this standard had no effect on the Companys statements of financial position and operations. In June 2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement Number 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation 41 Table of Contents outlines recognition thresholds and measurement attributes to determine the amount, if any, of a tax benefit to be recognized in an enterprises financial statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance on subsequent recognition, de recognition, measurement, recognition of interest and penalties, classification and disclosure. The Company has reviewed FIN 48 and has determined that its implementation will not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123R (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payments be recognized in the financial statements. During 2003, FIS adopted the fair value recognition provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), for stock based employee compensation, effective as of the beginning of 2003. FIS had elected to use the prospective method of transition, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS No. 148). Under this method, stock based employee compensation cost was recognized from the beginning of 2003 as if the fair value method of accounting had been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified, or settled in years beginning after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 123R does not allow for the prospective method, but requires the recording of expense relating to the vesting of all unvested options beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Since SFAS No. 123 was adopted in 2003, the impact of recording additional expense in 2006 under SFAS No. 123R relating to options granted prior to January 1, 2003 is not significant as all options accounted for under other methods were fully vested as of December 31, 2005. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks FIS is highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2006, it was paying interest on the Term Loan Facilities and Revolver at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25 to 1.75%, or (6.60 7.10%). As of January 18, 2007, FIS was paying interest on the new Credit Agreement at LIBOR plus 1.00%. A one percent increase in the LIBOR rate would increase its annual debt service on the Credit Agreement by $22.6 million (based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2006). The credit rating assigned to FIS by Standard & Poors is currently BB+ with a positive outlook. On April 11, 2005, FIS entered into interest rate swap agreements which have effectively fixed the interest rate at approximately 5.4% through April 2008 on $350 million of the term loan facilities and at approximately 5.2% through April 2007 on an additional $350 million of the term loan facilities. The estimated fair value of the cash flow hedges results in an asset of FIS of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2006, which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. 42 Table of Contents
