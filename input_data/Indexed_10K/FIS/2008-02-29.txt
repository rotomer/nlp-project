Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are one of the largest global providers of processing services to financial institutions, serving customers in over 80 countries throughout the world. We are among the market leaders in core processing, card issuing services, check point of sale verification and guarantee, mortgage processing, and certain other lender processing services in the U.S. We offer a diversified service mix, and benefit from the opportunity to cross sell multiple services across our broad customer base. We have two reporting segments, TPS and LPS, which produced approximately 63% and 37%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. TPS. This segment focuses on serving the processing needs of financial institutions. Our primary software applications function as the underlying infrastructure of a financial institutions core processing environment which banks use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts. We also provide a number 24 Table of Contents of complementary applications and services, such as item processing and electronic funds transfer, that interact directly with the core processing applications, including applications that facilitate interactions between our financial institution customers and their clients such as online banking and bill payment services and fraud prevention and detection services. We offer our applications and services through a range of delivery and service models, including on site outsourcing and remote processing arrangements, as well as on a licensed software basis for installation on customer owned and operated systems. This segment also includes card issuer services, which enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue VISA and MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards, and other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. In addition, we provide point of sale check verification and guarantee services to retailers. LPS. This segment provides outsourced business processes, core mortgage processing and information solutions primarily to national lenders and loan servicers. These processes include centralized title agency and closing services offered to first mortgage, refinance, home equity and sub prime lenders. This segments information solutions include appraisal and valuation services, real estate tax services and flood zone information. In addition, this segment provides default management services to national lenders and loan servicers, allowing customers to outsource the business processes necessary to take a loan and the underlying real estate securing the loan through the default and foreclosure process. On October 25, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a plan to pursue a spin off of the majority of our LPS division into a separate publicly traded company, which we refer to as LPS, Inc. The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead costs and other operations that are not included in the other segments. On September 12, 2007, we completed the eFunds acquisition. The eFunds businesses have been integrated into our operations within our TPS segment. Business Trends and Conditions Transaction Processing Services In the TPS business, increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth. In this segment, we compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process in house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi year recurring revenue streams. Generally, demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card related services. We continue to launch new services aimed at accommodating this demand. In recent years, we have introduced a variety of stored value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to the TPS businesses. When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. 25 Table of Contents Lender Processing Services Our mortgage processing services business, driven by MSP, is largely subject to the number of residential mortgage loans outstanding which is influenced by overall home ownership. The level of residential real estate activity, which depends in part on the level of interest rates, affects the level of revenues from many of the other businesses in the LPS segment. The slow down of real estate activity and the tightening of available credit in 2007 has resulted in a reduction in new loan origination and refinancing activity. The current MBA forecast is for $2.0 trillion of mortgage originations in 2008 as compared to $2.3 trillion in 2007. These factors are also likely to result in seasonal effects having more influence on real estate activity. Traditionally, the greatest volume of real estate activity, particularly residential resale transactions, has occurred in the spring and summer months. In contrast, current market conditions have increased the volume of residential mortgage defaults and thus favorably affected our default management services, which provide services relating to residential mortgage loans in default. The overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB No. 104), Revenue Recognition and related interpretations, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00 21 (EITF 00 21), Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants SOP No. 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), SOP No. 98 9 Modification of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions (SOP 98 9), and SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1). Recording revenues under the provisions of these pronouncements requires judgment, including determining whether or not an arrangement includes multiple elements, whether any of the elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements, and whether evidence of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain contract elements over time and changes to the elements in an arrangement, or in our ability to identify fair value for these elements, could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in our financial statements. The primary judgments relating to our revenue recognition are determining when all of the following criteria are met under SAB 104: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Under EITF 00 21, judgment is also required to determine whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. If the deliverables under a contract are software related as determined under SOP 97 2 or SOP 98 9, we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units. This determination, as well as managements ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) for the individual deliverables, can impact both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these agreements. The inability to establish VSOE for each contract deliverable results in having to record deferred revenues and or applying the residual method as defined in SOP 98 9. For arrangements where we determine VSOE for software maintenance using a stated renewal 26 Table of Contents rate within the contract, we use judgment to determine whether the renewal rate represents fair value for that element as if it had been sold on a stand alone basis. For a small percentage of revenues, we use contract accounting, as required by SOP No. 97 2, when the arrangement with the customer includes significant customization, modification, or production of software. For elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is recognized in accordance with SOP 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, using the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made. Occasionally, we are party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are a party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations. However the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Reserves for Check Guarantee Losses In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writers bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the checks face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates. We had accrued claims payable and accrued claims recoverable balances of $27.4 million and $39.4 million at December 31, 2007 and $30.0 million and $39.4 million at December 31, 2006, respectively. Historically, such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain, and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our customers, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $113.8 million and $102.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. A ten percent difference in our estimated gross check guarantee losses and our estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2007 could impact 2007 net earnings by approximately $4.5 million after tax. Computer Software Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, computer software, net of accumulated amortization was $780.7 million and $640.8 million, respectively. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. In determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate. Amortization expense for computer software 27 Table of Contents was $177.8 million, $130.2 million and $91.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software; however, we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates but could be subject such changes in the future. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions. These assets consist of purchased customer relationships, contracts, and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, goodwill was $5.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The process of determining whether or not an asset, such as goodwill, is impaired or recoverable relies on projections of future cash flows, operating results and market conditions. Such projections are inherently uncertain and, accordingly, actual future cash flows may differ materially from projected cash flows. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future net cash flows generated by the reporting units underlying assets. Such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in future business trends and economic conditions which can significantly influence our estimates of future net cash flows and discount rates. Changes to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair value of the reporting units and determination of the recoverability of goodwill potentially leading to charges against earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $1.0 billion, and consisted primarily of purchased customer relationships and trademarks. The valuation of these assets involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as customer retention, future cash flows and discount rates. If any of these assumptions change, it could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. Purchased customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates over a ten year period. All intangible assets that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with SFAS No. 142. During 2005, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $9.3 million to write off the carrying value of customer relationships which were terminated at one subsidiary in the LPS segment. The determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the intangible assets require significant judgment and may affect the amount of future amortization on the intangible assets other than goodwill. Amortization expense for intangible assets other than goodwill was $168.7 million, $175.6 million and $125.4 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There is an inherent uncertainty in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from intangible assets. We have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates but could be subject to them in the future. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However, final determination of prior year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially 28 Table of Contents different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made. Related Party Transactions We are party to certain historical related party agreements with FNF and other related parties. A detail of FNF related party items included in revenues is as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Data processing services revenue $ 46.8 $ 62.9 $ 56.9 Title plant information, maintenance, and management revenue 29.6 41.4 31.1 Software and services revenue 59.2 45.2 18.9 Other real estate related services 13.5 12.7 10.9 Total revenues $ 149.1 $ 162.2 $ 117.8 A detail of FNF related party items included in operating expenses (net of expense reimbursements) is as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Title plant information, maintenance, and management expense $ 3.7 $ 2.4 $ 3.0 Rent expense 5.0 Corporate services 2.7 9.5 29.0 Licensing, leasing, cost sharing, and other services 0.4 (12.9 ) (15.7 ) Total expenses $ 6.8 $ (1.0 ) $ 21.3 In addition to the items shown above, we received revenue from unaffiliated third parties of $132.2 million, $83.9 million and $80.9 million in each of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing commissions on title insurance policies placed by us on behalf of FNF. Descriptions of these related party agreements and other related party relationships is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Recent Developments Lender Processing Services Spin Off On October 25, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved pursuing a plan to spin off the businesses that currently make up our LPS segment into a stand alone publicly traded company which will be known as Lender Processing Services, Inc. (LPS, Inc.). As currently contemplated, we will contribute the majority of the assets and liabilities of this segment into LPS, Inc. in exchange for additional shares of the LPS, Inc. common stock and approximately $1.6 billion principal amount of LPS, Inc. debt securities. Following receipt of necessary approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and an opinion from our special tax advisor with respect to the tax free nature of the spin off, we will distribute 100% of the LPS, Inc. common stock to our shareholders in the spin off and exchange the LPS, Inc. debt securities for a like amount of our existing debt. We expect that the spin off will be tax free to FIS and our shareholders, and that the debt for debt exchange will be tax free to FIS. We will then retire the debt that is exchanged for the LPS, Inc. debt securities. Completion of the spin off is expected to occur in mid 2008. FISs current Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Carbiener, is expected to be the Chief Executive Officer of LPS, Inc. In January 2008, we filed a ruling request with the IRS regarding the tax free nature of the LPS, Inc. spin off and intend to file a preliminary Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC in the first quarter of 2008. Completion of the spin off is contingent upon the satisfaction or waiver of a variety of conditions, including final approval of the spin off and all related arrangements by our Board of Directors. The completion of the proposed 29 Table of Contents spin off is also subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those associated with our ability to contribute the LPS segment assets and liabilities to LPS, Inc., with the ability of LPS, Inc. to complete the debt exchange in the manner and on the terms currently contemplated, the possibility that necessary governmental approvals or actions (from the IRS, the SEC or other authorities) will not be obtained, and market conditions for the spin off. Evaluation of Check Services Business On August 2, 2007, we announced that our management is evaluating strategic alternatives for our U.S. and Australian check services businesses. Our Board of Directors authorized the plan, allowing management to investigate strategic alternatives. Check Services is a leading provider of retail point of sale check risk management solutions, as well as of cash access services to the gaming industry. Subsequent to year end, on February 28, 2008, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell Certegy Gaming Services, Inc. to Global Cash Access Holdings, Inc. for approximately $100.0 million in cash, which includes cash used to fund its ATM operations. The sale is expected to close in late March or early April of 2008. Factors Affecting Comparability Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions: On September 12, 2007, we acquired eFunds. eFunds provided risk management, EFT services, prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and internationally. In connection with this acquisition, we borrowed an additional $1.6 billion under our bank credit facilities. On August 31, 2007, we completed the sale of one of our subsidiaries, Property Insight, to FNF, for $95.0 million in cash, realizing a pre tax gain of $66.9 million ($42.1 million after tax) which is reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Property Insight was a leading provider of title plant services to FNF, as well as to various national and regional title insurance underwriters. Property Insight primarily managed, maintained, and updated the title insurance plants that are owned by FNF. As a result of the transaction, we received related party revenues from FNF through August 31, 2007, but incurred related party expenses relating to our title agency operations access to Property Insights data since the sale. On April 25, 2007, the board of directors of Covansys entered into an agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under which CSC agreed to acquire Covansys for $34.00 per share in an all cash transaction. The merger closed on July 3, 2007, and we exchanged our remaining 6.9 million shares of stock for cash, and 4.0 million warrants for cash, per the terms of the merger agreement. We realized a pre tax gain on sales of Covansys securities of $274.5 million in 2007. On February 1, 2006, we merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Certegy. The transaction resulted in a reverse acquisition with a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. Certegy provided credit card, debit card, and other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and internationally through two segments, Card Services and Check Services. Although the legal entity that survived the Certegy Merger was Certegy (which has since been renamed Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.), for accounting purposes, our historical financial statements are those of FIS. Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements include the results of operations of Certegy from the date of the acquisition. As a result of this transaction, the results of operations in the periods covered by the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements may not be directly comparable. 30 Table of Contents Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Processing and services revenues $ 4,758,016 $ 4,042,163 $ 2,688,218 Cost of revenues 3,401,931 2,875,250 1,750,199 Gross profit 1,356,085 1,166,913 938,019 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 504,130 498,246 411,918 Research and development costs 106,314 105,580 113,498 Operating income 745,641 563,087 412,603 Other income (expense): Interest income 4,543 4,373 6,223 Interest expense (228,340 ) (192,819 ) (126,778 ) Gain on sale of investment in Covansys 274,488 Other income (expense), net 15,913 (69 ) (4,237 ) Total other income (expense) 66,604 (188,515 ) (124,792 ) Earnings before income taxes, equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, minority interest, and discontinued operations 812,245 374,572 287,811 Provision for income taxes 300,530 139,232 107,066 Earnings before equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, minority interest, and discontinued operations 511,715 235,340 180,745 Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated entities 936 5,792 5,029 Minority interest (expense) income (2,192 ) (185 ) (4,450 ) Net earnings from continuing operations 510,459 240,947 181,324 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax 8,639 18,140 15,226 Gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax 42,124 Net earnings $ 561,222 $ 259,087 $ 196,550 Net earnings per share basic from continuing operations $ 2.64 $ 1.29 $ 1.42 Net earnings per share basic from discontinued operations 0.27 0.10 0.12 Net earnings per share basic $ 2.91 $ 1.39 $ 1.54 Weighted average shares outstanding basic 193,080 185,926 127,920 Net earnings per share diluted from continuing operations $ 2.60 $ 1.27 $ 1.41 Net earnings per share diluted from discontinued operations 0.26 0.10 0.12 Net earnings per share diluted $ 2.86 $ 1.37 $ 1.53 Weighted average shares outstanding diluted 196,546 189,196 128,354 Processing and Services Revenues Processing and services revenues totaled $4,758.0 million, $4,042.2 million and $2,688.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in revenue in 2007 of $715.8 million, or 17.7% as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to organic growth across both segments, as well as increases attributable to acquisitions and newly formed operations. The eFunds acquisition contributed $166.6 million in the TPS segment from its September 12, 2007 completion date through December 31, 2007 and the Certegy Merger contributed one 31 Table of Contents additional month of revenue in the current year, or approximately $96.4 million as compared to the full year 2006. The additional growth in the TPS segment was attributable to increased sales to new customers, particularly in our international operations. Our new Brazilian outsourcing operation added $40.5 million to the increase in the current year. The growth in the LPS segment was primarily the result of increased demand for services, due to market share gains and the current real estate market conditions, within our default management and appraisal businesses, partially offset by decreased demand for other real estate related businesses, decreased related party activity with FNF, and by the deconsolidation of Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions, Inc. (FNRES) in the current year. The increase in revenue in 2006 of $1,353.9 million as compared to 2005 is primarily due to incremental revenues from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, which contributed $1,067.2 million to the overall increase. The remaining 2006 increase is attributable to growth across both segments, including 15.2% growth in TPS, excluding the impact of Certegy, and 6.7% growth in LPS. The growth in TPS was driven by strong new sales within Integrated Financial Solutions and International, while the growth in LPS was driven by market share gains in default and appraisal services. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues totaled $3,401.9 million, $2,875.3 million and $1,750.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues of $526.6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to increased costs associated with increased revenues across both segments and the inclusion of expenses relating to eFunds since its acquisition date, which totaled $120.3 million. The impact of the one additional month of Certegy in the current year was approximately $76.0 million. The increases were slightly offset by the deconsolidation of FNRES in the current year. The increase in cost of revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 of $1,125.1 million was primarily due to incremental cost of revenues from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the overall increase. An increase in depreciation and amortization expense to $383.0 million in 2006 from $252.5 million in 2005 resulting from additional intangible amortization related to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the year over year increase. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 28.5%, 28.9% and 34.9% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The slight decrease in gross margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to the LPS segment, which has had significant growth in slightly lower margin service lines, particularly our appraisal services. We have also experienced declining margins in our tax and property exchange services due to overall slowing of the real estate market. The decrease in gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, because the historical Certegy businesses typically have lower margins than those of the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental intangible amortization expense relating to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the decrease in gross margin in 2006. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $504.1 million, $498.2 million and $411.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase of $5.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily resulted from the inclusion of $15.2 million of expenses relating to eFunds since its acquisition date, as well as one additional month of Certegy in the current year. These 2007 increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense, and the deconsolidation of FNRES in the current year. Stock based compensation decreased from $50.1 million in 2006 to $39.0 million in 2007. The decrease in stock based compensation is attributable to the $24.5 million in expense recorded for the vesting of the FIS performance based options granted in March 2005 for which the performance criteria was met during the first quarter of 2006 and an acceleration charge of $6.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the FNF Merger. Other cost reduction targets, related to the integration of Certegy, during the current year have been achieved, helping to further offset the additional expense related to eFunds and Certegy. The increase of $86.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to incremental selling, general and administrative expenses from the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which contributed $73.7 million to the overall increase. Additionally, the increase was partly due to an increase in stock based compensation expense which increased from $20.4 million during 2005 32 Table of Contents to $50.1 million for 2006. This increase in stock based compensation is primarily attributable to the $24.5 million and $6.1 million in transaction related expense described above. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs totaled $106.3 million, $105.6 million and $113.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating Income Operating income totaled $745.6 million, $563.1 million and $412.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) was 15.7%, 13.9% and 15.3% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in operating margin for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the increased revenues and achievement of expense synergies relating to the Certegy Merger. The year over year decrease in operating margin for 2006 is primarily due to incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger, increased stock based compensation costs and other merger related costs, as well as relatively lower gross profit percentage associated with the Certegy service lines, as noted above. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $228.3 million, $192.8 million and $126.8 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 is a result of our new debt related to the acquisition of eFunds, as well as the inclusion of $27.2 million in write offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our prior credit facility. The increases are partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates and the lower long term debt balance through the date of the eFunds acquisition. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to an increase in interest rates and higher average borrowings. The recapitalization that occurred late in the first quarter of 2005 resulted in a full year of interest in 2006 as compared to approximately ten months in 2005. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense totaled $300.5 million, $139.2 million and $107.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 37.0%, 37.2% and 37.2% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in tax expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 is attributable to increased operating income and the gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants. The decrease in the overall effective tax rate for 2007 is due to the increase in foreign pre tax income, which is taxed at overall lower rates. Net Earnings Net earnings from continuing operations totaled $510.5 million, $240.9 million and $181.3 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, or $2.60, $1.27 and $1.41 per diluted share, respectively. Included in net earnings in 2007 is an after tax gain of $172.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, from the sale of Covansys common stock and warrants. Net earnings from discontinued operations (including the gain on disposition of Property Insight) were $50.8 million, $18.1 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations totaled $0.26, $0.10 and $0.12 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Transaction Processing Services (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Processing and services revenues $ 2,985,077 $ 2,458,776 $ 1,208,430 Cost of revenues 2,308,728 1,914,148 904,124 Gross profit 676,349 544,628 304,306 Selling, general and administrative expenses 191,440 171,105 94,889 Research and development costs 70,378 70,879 85,702 Operating income $ 414,531 $ 302,644 $ 123,715 Revenues for the TPS segment are derived from three main revenue channels: Enterprise Solutions, Integrated Financial Solutions and International. Revenues from TPS totaled $2,985.1 million, $2,458.8 million and $1,208.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The overall segment increase of $526.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from the previously mentioned organic growth in our International and Integrated Financial Solutions business lines and in core processing revenues for large banks, combined with the impact of the acquisition of eFunds, which added incremental revenues of $166.6 million, and one additional month of Certegy revenues, which totaled $96.4 million. The launch of our Brazilian item processing operation during the third quarter of 2006 contributed $40.5 million to the increase. The increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenues in our retail point of sale authorization business. The overall segment increase of $1,250.4 million during 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed $1,067.2 million to the overall increase. Like 2007, the majority of the remaining 2006 growth is attributable to organic growth within Integrated Financial Solutions and International revenue channels, with International including $31.9 million related to the newly formed business process outsourcing operation in Brazil. Cost of revenues for the TPS segment totaled $2,308.7 million, $1,914.1 million and $904.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The overall segment increase of $394.6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from increased labor and other variable costs associated with increased revenues, the impact of the acquisition of eFunds, and one additional month of Certegy. The overall segment increase of $1,010.0 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the increase. Gross margin was 22.7%, 22.2% and 25.2% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in gross margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to lower intangible amortization expense. The decrease in gross margin in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, which businesses typically have lower margins than those of the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the decrease in gross margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the TPS segment totaled $191.4 million, $171.1 million and $94.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase of $20.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to increased labor costs, the impact of the acquisition of eFunds, and one additional month of Certegy, offset by achieving cost reduction targets related to the integration of Certegy during the current year. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed $73.7 million to the overall increase of $76.2 million. Research and development costs for the TPS segment totaled $70.4 million, $70.9 million and $85.7 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating income for the TPS segment totaled $414.5 million, $302.6 million and $123.7 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 13.9%, 12.3% and 10.2% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily resulted from the increased gross margin, as well as a decrease, as a percentage of revenue, of 0.6% in selling, general, and administrative expenses and 0.5% in research and development costs. The increase in operating margin for 2006 as compared to 2005 resulted from a decrease, as a percentage of revenue, of 0.9% in selling, general and administrative expenses and 4.2% in research and development costs, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin as discussed above. 34 Table of Contents Lender Processing Services (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Processing and services revenues $ 1,761,102 $ 1,584,170 $ 1,484,294 Cost of revenues 1,093,203 961,102 846,075 Gross profit 667,899 623,068 638,219 Selling, general and administrative expenses 188,902 197,419 223,951 Research and development costs 35,936 34,701 27,796 Operating income $ 443,061 $ 390,948 $ 386,472 Revenues for the LPS segment totaled $1,761.1 million, $1,584.2 million and $1,484.3 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The overall segment increase of $176.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from accelerating demand for services within our default management businesses, which contributed an increase of $206.7 million, and in our appraisal services, which contributed $75.3 million. These increases are partially offset by decreased demand for other real estate related businesses, decreased related party activity with FNF, and by the deconsolidation of FNRES in the current year. The overall segment increase of $99.9 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 was the result of growth across most of the business lines, but primarily due to increased demand for our appraisal services along with growth in our default management businesses. Cost of revenues for the LPS segment totaled $1,093.2 million, $961.1 million and $846.1 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The overall segment increase of $132.1 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, as well as the increase of $115.0 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, resulted from increased personnel, data processing, and other variable costs associated with increased business. The deconsolidation of FNRES slightly offset the increase in 2007. Gross margin was 37.9%, 39.3% and 43.0% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in gross margin in 2007 as compared to 2006, as well as 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily due to significant growth in lower margin service lines, particularly our appraisal services and other certain default services, along with declining margins in our tax services due to lower volumes and the lengthening of the service period. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the LPS segment totaled $188.9 million, $197.4 million and $224.0 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease of $8.5 million in 2007 as compared to 2006, as well as the decrease of $26.5 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of cost control measures and the increased revenue base in the TPS segment for allocating certain combined selling and administrative expenses. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 is also related to the deconsolidation of FNRES, partially offset by increased headcount in the default management businesses, and increased overhead costs. Research and development costs for the LPS segment totaled $35.9 million, $34.7 million and $27.8 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating income for the LPS segment totaled $443.1 million, $390.9 million and $386.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating margin was 25.2%, 24.7% and 26.0% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2007, as compared to 2006, as well as 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily results from our increased revenue, partially offset by our decreasing gross margin. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead costs that are not included in the other segments. Corporate costs are primarily incurred directly by us; however, the 2006 period includes some amounts that were allocated from FNF prior to our merger with Old FNF, including stock based compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $123.8 million, $129.7 million and $93.1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 of $5.9 million primarily relates to a decrease in stock based compensation expense, partially offset by additional costs associated with the eFunds acquisition and an increase in salaries and other labor costs. The increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 of $36.6 million primarily relates to an increase in stock based compensation expense which increased from $20.4 million in 2005 to $50.1 million in 2006, as well as an increase in merger and merger related integration costs. The increase in stock 35 Table of Contents based compensation primarily related to the $24.5 million in expense recorded in the first quarter of 2006 for the vesting of the FIS performance based options granted in March of 2005 for which the performance criteria were met during 2006 and a $6.1 million charge related to the acceleration of vesting of stock options recorded in the fourth quarter relating to the FNF Merger. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures, stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings. At December 31, 2007, we had cash on hand of $355.3 million and debt of approximately $4,275.4 million, including the current portion. We expect cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt absent any unusual circumstances such as acquisitions or adverse changes in the business environment. We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $.05 per common share is payable March 27, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2008. We intend to limit dilution caused by option exercises, including anticipated exercises, by repurchasing shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to an additional $200.0 million worth of our common stock. During 2007, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our stock for $80.3 million, at an average price of $49.15 under this program. Cash Flows from Operations Cash flows from operations were $463.6 million, $494.7 million and $426.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. Included in 2007 cash flow from operations were payments of $106.6 million of tax liability relating to the gain on Covansys and a $47.5 million reduction in taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Included in 2006 cash flow from operations was a $26.9 million reduction in taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Capital Expenditures Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. In 2007, we spent approximately $343.3 million on capital expenditures, and in 2008 we expect to spend approximately $280.0 million to $300.0 million, primarily on equipment, purchased software and internally developed software. Financing On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party thereto (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior term loans and revolver as well as a $100 million settlement facility. As a result of the new credit agreement, we repaid the old credit agreement and recorded a charge of $27.2 million to write off unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs. The Credit Agreement, which became secured as of September 12, 2007, provides for a committed $2.1 billion five year term facility denominated in U.S. Dollars (the Term Loan A) and a committed $900 million revolving credit 36 Table of Contents facility (the Revolving Loan) with a sublimit of $250 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (the Maturity Date). The Revolving Loan is bifurcated into a $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan (the Multicurrency Tranche) that can be denominated in any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant lenders agree to make advances and a $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under the Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $600 million, which would be made available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the amount requested by us. On July 30, 2007, we, along with the requisite lenders, executed an amendment to the existing Credit Agreement to facilitate our acquisition of eFunds. The amendment permitted the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in additional loans, an increase from the foregoing $600 million. The amendment became effective September 12, 2007. On September 12, 2007, we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain a secured $1.6 billion tranche of term loans denominated in U.S. Dollars (the Term Loan B) under the Credit Agreement, utilizing $1.6 billion of the $2.1 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount. The Term Loan B proceeds were used to finance the eFunds acquisition, and pay related fees and expenses. The Term Loan B will mature on January 18, 2014. Debt issuance costs of $25.9 million are capitalized at December 31, 2007 and will be amortized over the life of the agreement. As of December 31, 2007, the Term Loan A balance was $2,047.5 million, the Term Loan B balance was $1,596.0 million and a total of $308.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Loan. The obligations under the Credit Agreement have been jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, we and certain subsidiary guarantors other than eFunds pledged certain equity interests we and they held in other entities (including certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries) as collateral security for the obligations under the credit facility and the guarantee. The pledge also serves to equally and ratably secure our obligations under our outstanding 4.75% notes due 2008, discussed below. We may borrow, repay and re borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the Revolving Loan. We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A in scheduled installments of: (a) $13.1 million per quarter from June 30, 2007 through December 31, 2008; (b) $26.3 million per quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009; and (c) $52.5 million per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of approximately $1.5 billion payable on the Maturity Date. We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan B in scheduled installments of $4.0 million per quarter from December 31, 2007 through September 30, 2013 with the remaining balance of approximately $1.5 billion payable on January 18, 2014. As discussed above, we expect to exchange LPS, Inc. debt securities we will receive in connection with the LPS, Inc. spin off for our outstanding Term Loan B, which will immediately thereafter be retired. In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the Term Loans are (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and sales of assets, as well as from a percentage of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) between zero and fifty percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans are generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice. The Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. The outstanding balance of the Loans bears interest at a floating rate, which is an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) the Eurocurrency (LIBOR) rate or (b) either (i) the federal funds rate or (ii) the prime rate. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a leverage ratio (our total indebtedness to our EBITDA in our consolidated subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit Agreement). Alternatively, we have the ability to request the lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances under the Revolving Loan. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, a prohibition on the payment of dividends and other restricted 37 Table of Contents payments if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the loan. Events of default include conditions customary for such an agreement, including failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants. These events of default include a cross default provision that permits the lenders to declare the Credit Agreement in default if (i) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of $150 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other term under any such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders thereof may cause it to become due and payable prior to its maturity. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2007. Both the Credit Agreement and the 4.75% notes referred to below are equally and ratably secured by a pledge of equity interests in our subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions for subsidiaries not required to be pledged. As of December 31, 2007, the shares of subsidiaries representing less than 10% of our net assets were subject to such pledge. Through the Certegy Merger, we have an obligation to service $200.0 million (aggregate principal amount) of secured 4.75% fixed rate notes due in 2008. The notes were recorded in purchase accounting at a discount of $5.7 million, which is being amortized over the term of the notes. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on each March 15 and September 15. The notes include customary events of default, including a cross default provision that permits the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the Notes to declare the Notes in default if (i) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of $10 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other term under any such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders thereof have caused it to become due and payable prior to its maturity. Through the eFunds acquisition on September 12, 2007, we assumed $100.0 million in long term notes payable previously issued to eFunds (the eFunds Notes). Subsequent to year end, we redeemed the eFunds Notes for a total of $109.3 million, which includes a make whole premium of $9.3 million. We completed the redemption on February 26, 2008. We have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term Loans from variable to fixed (in millions): Bank Pays FIS pays Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount Variable Rate of(1) Fixed Rate of(2) April 11, 2005 April 11, 2008 $ 150.0 1 Month Libor 4.39 % April 11, 2005 April 11, 2008 145.0 1 Month Libor 4.37 % April 11, 2005 April 11, 2008 55.0 1 Month Libor 4.37 % April 11, 2007 April 11, 2010 850.0 1 Month Libor 4.92 % October 11, 2007 October 11, 2009 1,000.0 1 Month Libor 4.73 % December 11, 2007 December 11, 2009 250.0 1 Month Libor 3.80 % December 11, 2007 December 11, 2010 750.0 1 Month Libor 3.85 % $ 3,200.0 (1) 4.60% as of December 31, 2007. (2) In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we pay an applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan A of 1.25% and the Term Loan B of 1.75%. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The estimated fair value of these cash flow hedges results in a liability of $41.2 million and an asset of $4.9 million, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets or liabilities and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term Loans. 38 Table of Contents Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our policy to execute such instruments with credit worthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Contractual Obligations FISs long term contractual obligations generally include its long term debt and operating lease payments on certain of its property and equipment. The following table summarizes FISs significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 272,014 $ 142,850 $ 226,000 $ 173,500 $ 1,945,033 $ 1,516,000 $ 4,275,397 Interest 254,716 238,554 227,320 218,416 109,226 101,987 1,150,219 Operating leases 83,382 63,060 35,269 21,598 14,860 30,869 249,038 Investment commitments 47,514 47,514 Purchase commitments 33,264 33,264 Data processing and maintenance commitments 198,290 171,411 107,105 63,010 61,035 287,479 888,330 Total $ 889,180 $ 615,875 $ 595,694 $ 476,524 $ 2,130,154 $ 1,936,335 $ 6,643,762 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements FIS does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. Escrow Arrangements In conducting our title agency, closing and 1031 exchange services operations, we routinely hold customers assets in escrow, pending completion of real estate transactions. Certain of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We have a contingent liability relating to proper disposition of these balances, which amounted to $1,926.8 million at December 31, 2007. As a result of holding these customers assets in escrow, we have ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks. There were no loans outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and these balances were invested in short term, high grade investments that minimize the risk to principal. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)), requiring an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related restructuring costs will be recognized separately. Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date and adjusted prospectively as new information becomes available. When the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. Under SFAS 141(R), all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and will apply to business combinations occurring after the effective date. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our statements of financial position and operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160), requiring noncontrolling interests (sometimes called minority interests) to be presented as a component of equity on the balance sheet. SFAS 160 also requires that the amount of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. This statement eliminates the need to apply purchase 39 Table of Contents accounting when a parent company acquires a noncontrolling ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires that, upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income after which any retained noncontrolling interest will be reported at fair value. SFAS 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interest of the noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries. SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be applied prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our statements of financial position and operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 mandates certain financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements when a company elects to report assets and liabilities at fair value under SFAS 159. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of January 1, 2008 for calendar year entities. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on our statements of financial position and operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks As of December 31, 2007, we are paying interest on the Credit Agreement at LIBOR plus 1.25% and LIBOR plus 1.75% on our Term Loan A and Term Loan B, respectively. A one percent increase in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service on the Credit Agreement by $10.2 million (based on principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007, net of interest rate swaps). The credit rating assigned to FIS by Standard Poors was BB at December 31, 2007. We have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term Loans from variable to fixed (in millions): Bank Pays FIS pays Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount Variable Rate of(1) Fixed Rate of(2) April 11, 2005 April 11, 2008 $ 150.0 1 Month Libor 4.39 % April 11, 2005 April 11, 2008 145.0 1 Month Libor 4.37 % April 11, 2005 April 11, 2008 55.0 1 Month Libor 4.37 % April 11, 2007 April 11, 2010 850.0 1 Month Libor 4.92 % October 11, 2007 October 11, 2009 1,000.0 1 Month Libor 4.73 % December 11, 2007 December 11, 2009 250.0 1 Month Libor 3.80 % December 11, 2007 December 11, 2010 750.0 1 Month Libor 3.85 % $ 3,200.0 (1) 4.60% as of December 31, 2007. (2) In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we pay an applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Revolving Loan and the Term Loan A of 1.25% and the Term Loan B of 1.75%. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The estimated fair value of these cash flow hedges results in a liability of $41.2 million and an asset of $4.9 million, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets or liabilities and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term Loans. Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our policy to execute such instruments with credit worthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 40 Table of Contents
