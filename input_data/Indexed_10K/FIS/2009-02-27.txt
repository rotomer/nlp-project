Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following section discusses managements view of the financial condition and results of operations of FIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes of FIS included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section. Overview We are one of the largest global providers of processing services to financial institutions and businesses, serving customers in over 90 countries throughout the world. We are among the market leaders in core processing, card issuing services and check point of sale verification and guarantee. We offer a diversified service mix, and benefit from the opportunity to cross sell multiple services across 18 Table of Contents our broad customer base. We have four reporting segments: Financial Solutions, Payment Solutions, International and Corporate and Other. A description of these segments is included above in Item 1. Revenues by Segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations. Business Trends and Conditions Increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth. We compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process in house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi year recurring revenue streams. Generally, demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over time as service providers such as us realize economies of scale and improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card related services. We continue to launch new services aimed at accommodating this demand. In recent years, we have introduced a variety of stored value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common theme among these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses. When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. We believe that we are facing one of the most difficult times that has ever existed for financial institutions, retailers and other businesses in the United States and internationally. We expect there to be a significant number of bank failures in the next few years, which may be offset to a degree by somewhat decreased bank acquisition activity. However, we believe that our potential exposure to bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred to date is less than one half of one percent of our revenues. Additionally this exposure does not consider any incremental revenues we may generate from potential license fees or service associated with assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial failures. We believe that software sales will be the most at risk as far as discretionary purchases that financial institutions may defer. However, software sales represent approximately 5% of our revenues and thus any decrease should not have a significant impact on our results of operations. While we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the current financial crisis, there are factors outside our control that might impact our operating results that we may not be able to fully anticipate as to timing and severity, including but not limited to adverse effects if banks are nationalized, continued global economic conditions worsening, causing further slowdown in consumer spending and lending and the impact on our ability to access capital should any or our lenders fail. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing and credit and debit card processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services and products. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. Occasionally, we are party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual 19 Table of Contents contracts we are party to, the impact of judgements and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $40.6 million and $53.4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from 2007 is primarily related to the LPS spin off. Reserves for Check Guarantee Losses In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writers bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the checks face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates. Historically, such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain, and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our customers, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $98.1 million and $113.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. A ten percent difference in our estimated gross check guarantee losses and our estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2008 could impact 2008 net earnings by approximately $2.2 million after tax. Computer Software Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, computer software, net of accumulated amortization, was $617.0 million and $775.2 million, respectively. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. In determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate. Amortization expense for computer software was $149.9 million, $177.8 million and $130.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in those years was amortization expense on computer software of $14.8 million, $32.5 million, and $30.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. While we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. We generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives 20 Table of Contents assigned to our definite lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the assets useful life is no longer indefinite. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 142 requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the units net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions. During the fourth quarter of 2008, immediately prior to our annual measurement date for impairment testing, our market capitalization declined to a point below our book value. Our annual impairment test indicated that no impairment has occurred, based on our assumptions of discounted future cash flows using our current best estimate of future performance. In December of 2008, upon the change in our reporting segments and in light of the fact that our market capitalization continued to remain below our book value, we performed new impairment tests on a segment basis and determined that no impairments existed. The Company has reconciled the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the consolidated Company. We believe that the overall market conditions that existed at the measurement dates and continue to exist because of the financial crisis have led to a market capitalization well below the fair value of a controlling interest. Based on these factors, we concluded that the market capitalization does not represent the fair value of the Company. Our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets did indicate an impairment of our check trademark. Accordingly we recorded a charge of $52.0 million to reduce the intangible assets carrying value to fair value (Note 11). Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the Statement of Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However, final determination of prior year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made. Related Party Transactions We are a party to certain historical related party agreements with FNF, LPS and other related parties (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report). Factors Affecting Comparability Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions: 21 Table of Contents On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin off. The results of operations of the Lender Processing Services segment through the July 2, 2008 spin off date are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, in accordance with SFAS 144, for all periods presented. On September 12, 2007, we acquired eFunds. eFunds provided risk management, EFT services, prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and internationally. In connection with this acquisition, we borrowed an additional $1.6 billion under our bank credit facilities. The results of operations and financial position of eFunds are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from and after the date of acquisition. On August 31, 2007, we completed the sale of one of our subsidiaries, Property Insight, to FNF, for $95.0 million in cash, realizing a pre tax gain of $66.9 million ($42.1 million after tax) which is reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with SFAS 144. Property Insight was a leading provider of title plant services to FNF, as well as to various national and regional title insurance underwriters. Property Insight primarily managed, maintained, and updated the title insurance plants that are owned by FNF. On April 25, 2007, the board of directors of Covansys entered into an agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under which CSC agreed to acquire Covansys for $34.00 per share in an all cash transaction. The merger closed on July 3, 2007, and we exchanged our remaining 6.9 million shares of stock in Covansys for cash, and 4.0 million warrants for cash, per the terms of the merger agreement. We realized a pre tax gain on sales of Covansys securities of $274.5 million in 2007. On February 1, 2006, we completed the Certegy Merger. The transaction resulted in a reverse acquisition with a total purchase price of approximately $2.2 billion. Certegy provided credit card, debit card, and other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and internationally through two segments, Card Services and Check Services. Although the legal entity that survived the Certegy Merger was Certegy (which has since been renamed Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.), for accounting purposes, our historical financial statements are those of FIS. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of operations of Certegy from the date of the acquisition. As a result of the above transactions, the results of operations in the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be directly comparable. Consolidated Results of Operations (in millions, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 (In millions, except per share amounts) Processing and services revenues $ 3,446.0 $ 2,921.0 $ 2,416.5 Cost of revenues 2,636.9 2,265.8 1,872.2 Gross profit 809.1 655.2 544.3 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 389.4 302.9 279.8 Research and development costs 84.8 70.4 70.9 Operating income 334.9 281.9 193.6 Other income (expense): Interest income 6.3 3.0 1.3 Interest expense (163.5 ) (190.2 ) (190.9 ) Gain on sale of investment in Covansys 274.5 Other income (expense), net 1.5 14.8 1.2 Total other income (expense) (155.7 ) 102.1 (188.4 ) Earnings before income taxes, equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, minority interest, and discontinued operations 179.2 384.0 5.2 Provision for income taxes 57.6 136.2 (2.9 ) Earnings before equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, minority interest, and discontinued operations 121.6 247.8 8.1 Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated entities (0.2 ) 2.8 5.8 Minority interest (expense) income (4.0 ) 0.1 1.7 Net earnings from continuing operations 117.4 250.7 15.6 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax 97.4 310.5 243.5 Net earnings $ 214.8 $ 561.2 $ 259.1 22 Table of Contents 2008 2007 2006 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings per share basic from continuing operations $ 0.61 $ 1.30 $ 0.08 Net earnings per share basic from discontinued operations 0.51 1.61 1.31 Net earnings per share basic $ 1.12 $ 2.91 $ 1.39 Weighted average shares outstanding basic 191.6 193.1 185.9 Net earnings per share diluted from continuing operations $ 0.61 $ 1.28 $ 0.08 Net earnings per share diluted from discontinued operations 0.50 1.58 1.29 Net earnings per share diluted $ 1.11 $ 2.86 $ 1.37 Weighted average shares outstanding diluted 193.5 196.5 189.2 Processing and Services Revenues Processing and services revenues totaled $3,446.0 million, $2,921.0 million and $2,416.5 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in revenue during 2008 of $525.0 million, or 18.0% as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the eFunds acquisition, which contributed year over year incremental revenues of $396.3 million. Additionally our Brazilian card processing venture, the Brazilian Venture had a year over year increase in revenue of $87.7 million. The increase in revenue in 2007 of $504.5 million as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to revenue increases from the eFunds and Certegy acquisitions along with organic growth. The eFunds acquisition contributed revenues of $166.6 million from its September 12, 2007 completion date through December 31, 2007 and the Certegy Merger contributed one additional month of revenue in the 2007 period, or approximately $96.4 million, as compared to the full year 2006. The Brazilian Venture contributed $49.2 million to revenue growth in 2007, with other growth in international revenues comprising most of the year over year organic growth. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of revenues totaled $2,636.9 million, $2,265.8 million and $1,872.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $809.1 million, $655.2 million and $544.3 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 23.5%, 22.4% and 22.5% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues of $371.1 million in the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period is directly attributable to revenue growth across our three operating segments. The increase in gross margin of 1.1% for 2008 over 2007 was driven by the growth of higher product margin sales and gained efficiencies relating to the integration of eFunds. The increase in cost of revenues of $393.6 million in the 2007 period as compared to the 2006 period was attributable to growth in our three operating segments primarily driven by the eFunds acquisition. The gross margin decreased slightly due to the costs associated with the eFunds acquisition including restructuring and integration as well as increased amortization expense relating to purchased intangibles. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $389.4 million, $302.9 million and $279.8 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase of $86.5 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily relates to the incremental costs from the eFunds acquisition, as well as increased stock compensation costs, additional restructuring and integration charges, and charges associated with the LPS spin off. Stock based compensation increased from $24.9 million in 2007 to $51.6 million in 2008. The $26.7 million increase in stock based compensation is mainly attributable to charges of $14.1 million for the accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds employees assumed in the eFunds acquisition and $2.6 million relating to the acceleration, upon termination, of certain unvested executive stock awards. The remaining increase is attributable to $21.0 million of additional restructuring and integration charges and $9.3 million in charges associated with the spin off of LPS as compared to $6.0 million and $0.5 million respectively in 2007. The increase of $23.1 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily resulted from the inclusion of $15.2 million of expenses relating to eFunds since its acquisition date, as well as one additional month of Certegy expenses. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs totaled $84.8 million, $70.4 million and $70.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in research and development costs for 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily related to the eFunds acquisition. Operating Income Operating income totaled $334.9 million, $281.9 million and $193.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) was 9.7%, 9.7% and 8.0% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in operating margin for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the increased revenues and achievement of expense synergies relating to the Certegy Merger. 23 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $163.5 million, $190.2 million and $190.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease of $26.7 million in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 is the result of a reduction of $1.6 billion in debt associated with the LPS spin off on July 2, 2008 and the inclusion of $27.2 million in write offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our prior credit facility during 2007, partially offset by the write off of $12.4 million in capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan B retired in conjunction with the LPS spin off in 2008. Additionally, the impact of our interest rate swaps, which has effectively fixed $2.1 billion of our debt at a rate of approximately 4.7%, offset the favorable decrease in borrowing rates under our credit facility. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily the result of lower interest rates during 2007 partially offset by the inclusion of $27.2 million in write offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our prior credit facility. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations totaled $57.6 million, $136.2 million and ($2.9) million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 32.1%, 35.5% and (55.2%) for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in tax expense for the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period is attributable to the 2007 period including the gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants, partially offset by increased operating income in the 2008 period. The decrease in the 2008 overall effective tax rate is primarily related to state tax benefits and benefits related to research and development credits. The increase in tax expense for the 2007 period as compared to a tax benefit in 2006 is attributable to the gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants and increased operating income in the 2007 period. The 2006 year included certain favorable permanent book/tax differences and proportionately higher foreign income taxed at overall lower rates. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Net earnings from continuing operations totaled $117.4 million, $250.7 million and $15.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $0.61, $1.28 and $0.08 per diluted share, respectively. The decrease in net earnings in 2008 is primarily the result of 2007 including an after tax gain of $172.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, from the sale of Covansys common stock and warrants, partially offset by the inclusion of eFunds for the full year 2008 as compared to the period from its acquisition date September 12, 2007 through December 31, 2007. Segment Results of Operations Financial Solutions (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Processing and services revenues $ 1,158.8 $ 1,007.6 $ 882.2 Operating income $ 355.1 $ 203.1 $ 181.4 Revenues for the Financial Solutions segment totaled $1,158.8 million, $1,007.6 million and $882.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall segment increase of $151.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition that occurred on September 12, 2007 and organic growth within our existing business. Incremental revenue from the eFunds acquisition contributed a year over year increase of $143.3 million. The overall segment increase of $125.4 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to organic growth of 7.9% and incremental revenue from the eFunds acquisition of $56.1 million. Operating income for the Financial Solutions segment totaled $355.1 million, $203.1 million and $181.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 31%, 20% and 21% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily resulted from increased operating margins due to targeted cost reductions coupled with the relatively higher margin on the additional revenues from eFunds. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the eFunds acquisition. Payment Solutions (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Processing and services revenues $ 1,530.2 $ 1,298.8 $ 1,120.5 Operating income $ 347.8 $ 291.8 $ 253.9 24 Table of Contents Revenues for the Payment Solutions segment totaled $1,530.2 million, $1,298.8 million and $1,120.5 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall segment increase of $231.4 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition, which contributed year over year incremental revenue of $210.5 million. The overall segment increase of $178.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted principally from organic growth of 8.0% and year over year growth from the eFunds acquisition of $88.9 million. Operating income for the Payment Solutions segment totaled $347.8 million, $291.8 million and $253.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 23% for all three years, thus the year over year increases results from the margin on the incremental revenues. International (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Processing and services revenues $ 759.5 $ 618.1 $ 430.3 Operating income $ 49.5 $ 44.7 $ 38.3 Revenues for the International segment totaled $759.5 million, $618.1 million and $430.3 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall segment increase of $141.4 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted principally from increased revenue in our Brazilian Venture and incremental revenues due to the eFunds acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of $28.2 million. The Brazilian Venture had a year over year increase in revenues of $87.7 million and the eFunds acquisition contributed year over year incremental revenue of $41.5 million. The overall segment increase of $187.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 was the result of a $56.4 million increase in financial solutions revenue and a $131.4 million increase in payment solutions revenue. The majority of the $56.4 million increase in financial solutions revenue was due to organic growth, principally in Germany. Of the $131.4 million increase in payment solutions revenue, $58.3 million was due to growth in credit cards principally due to growth in the Brazilian Venture, $40.5 million was due to the addition of the BPO business in Brazil, $8.9 million was due to organic growth in other regions and $23.7 million was due to incremental revenue from the eFunds acquisition. Operating income for the International segment totaled $49.5 million, $44.7 million and $38.3 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin was 7%, 7% and 9% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2008, as compared to 2007, as well as 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily results from margins on the incremental revenues. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were $417.5 million, $257.7 million and $280.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $159.8 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 is attributable to the effect of incremental expenses related to the eFunds acquisition, additional stock compensation expense, incremental restructuring and integration charges and costs associated with the LPS spin off. Stock based compensation increased from $24.9 million in 2007 to $51.6 million in 2008. The $26.7 million increase in stock based compensation is mainly attributable to charges of $14.1 million for the accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds employees assumed in the eFunds acquisition and $2.6 million relating to the acceleration, upon termination, of certain unvested executive stock awards. Intangible asset amortization increased $46.6 million as compared to 2007 primarily relating to the eFunds acquisition coupled with an impairment charge of $26.0 million related to a decline in the fair value of the retail check guarantee business. Corporate expenses also include $21.0 million of restructuring and integration charges and $9.3 million in costs associated with the LPS spin off. The overall corporate and other decrease of $22.3 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to a decrease in administrative costs due to cost reduction targets related to the integration of Certegy. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures, stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings. At December 31, 2008, we had cash on hand of $220.9 million and debt of approximately $2,514.5 million, including the current portion. Of the $220.9 million cash on hand, approximately $139.8 million is held by our operations in foreign jurisdictions. We 25 Table of Contents expect that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt absent any unusual circumstances such as acquisitions or adverse changes in the business environment. We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share is payable March 30, 2009 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2009. Cash Flows from Operations Cash flows from operations were $596.4 million, $463.5 million and $494.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Included in the 2007 period cash flow from operations were payments of $106.6 million of tax liability relating to the gain on Covansys and a $47.5 million reduction in taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Included in 2006 cash flow from operations was a $26.9 million reduction in taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Capital Expenditures Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. In 2008, we spent approximately $255.4 million on capital expenditures, including approximately $25.0 million related to LPS prior to the spin off. In 2009 we expect to spend approximately 5% to 7% of 2009 revenue on capital expenditures. Financing On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party thereto (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement replaced our prior term loans and revolver as well as a $100 million settlement facility. As a result of the new credit agreement, we repaid the old credit agreement and recorded a charge of $27.2 million to write off unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs. The Credit Agreement, which became secured as of September 12, 2007, provides for a committed $2.1 billion five year term facility denominated in U.S. Dollars (the Term Loan A) and a committed $900 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Loan) with a sublimit of $250 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date, January 18, 2012 (the Maturity Date). The Revolving Loan is bifurcated into a $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan (the Multicurrency Tranche) that can be denominated in any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant lenders agree to make advances and a $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under the Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $600 million, which would be made available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the amount requested by us. On July 30, 2007, we, along with the requisite lenders, executed an amendment to the existing Credit Agreement to facilitate our acquisition of eFunds. The amendment permitted the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in additional loans, an increase from the foregoing $600 million. The amendment became effective September 12, 2007. On September 12, 2007, we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain a secured $1.6 billion tranche of term loans denominated in U.S. Dollars (the Term Loan B) under the Credit Agreement, utilizing $1.6 billion of the $2.1 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount. The Term Loan B proceeds were used to finance the eFunds Acquisition, and pay related fees and expenses. On July 2, 2008, we completed the spin off of our former Lender Processing Services segment into a separate publicly traded company, Lender Processing Services, Inc., referred to as LPS. In conjunction with the LPS spin off, we immediately retired the outstanding $1,585.0 million principal balance of the Term Loan B. Debt issuance costs of $9.1 million are capitalized as of December 31, 2008. The $12.4 million remaining balance of Term Loan B debt issuance costs were written off during July 2008 in conjunction with the LPS spin off and retirement of the Term Loan B. As of December 31, 2008, the Term Loan A balance was $1,995.0 million and a total of $499.4 million was outstanding under the Revolving Loan. The obligations under the Credit Agreement have been jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, we and certain subsidiary guarantors pledged certain equity interests in other entities (including certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries) as collateral security for the obligations under the credit facility and the guarantee. 26 Table of Contents We may borrow, repay and re borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the Revolving Loan. We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A in scheduled installments of: (a) $13.1 million per quarter from June 30, 2007 through December 31, 2008; (b) $26.3 million per quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009; and (c) $52.5 million per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of approximately $1.5 billion payable on the Maturity Date. In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the Term Loan is (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and sales of assets, as well as from a percentage of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) between zero and fifty percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008. No mandatory prepayments were owed for the year ended December 31, 2008. Voluntary prepayment of the Loan is generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice. The Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. The outstanding balance on the Loans bears interest at a floating rate, which is an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) the Eurocurrency (LIBOR) rate or (b) either (i) the federal funds rate or (ii) the prime rate. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a leverage ratio (our total indebtedness to our consolidated total EBITDA in our consolidated subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit Agreement). Alternatively, we have the ability to request the lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances under the Revolving Loan. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, a prohibition on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the Loans. Events of default include conditions customary for such an agreement, including failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants. These events of default include a cross default provision that permits the lenders to declare the Credit Agreement in default if (i) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of $150 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other term under any such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders thereof may cause it to become due and payable prior to its maturity. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (see Item 7A). Contractual Obligations FIS long term contractual obligations generally include its long term debt and operating lease payments on certain of its property and equipment. The following table summarizes FIS significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 105.5 $ 210.0 $ 157.5 $ 2,041.5 $ $ $ 2,514.5 Interest 133.4 100.0 87.6 4.1 325.1 Operating leases 62.9 47.4 31.4 18.6 13.2 27.1 200.6 Data processing and maintenance and purchase commitments 138.4 93.6 68.2 54.0 52.0 177.8 584.0 Total $ 440.2 $ 451.0 $ 344.7 $ 2,118.2 $ 65.2 $ 204.9 $ 3,624.2 FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS expected short term liquidity needs and its long term needs for the operations of its business, expected capital spending for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements FIS does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 27 Table of Contents In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, which will become effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and will be applied retrospectively. Under the FSP, unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share (EPS) pursuant to the two class method. The two class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Adoption of FSP Emerging Issues Task Force 03 6 1 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of its operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS 162). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The FASB has concluded that the generally accepted accounting principles hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB and issued SFAS 162 to achieve that result. SFAS 162 was effective on November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of its operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 expands the current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 133) such that entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives, how derivatives and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the entitys financial position, performance and cash flow. Pursuant to the transition provisions of the Statement, the Company will adopt SFAS 161 in fiscal year 2009 and will present the required disclosures in the prescribed format on a prospective basis. SFAS 161 will not impact the consolidated financial results as it is disclosure only in nature. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160), requiring noncontrolling interests (sometimes called minority interests) to be presented as a component of equity on the balance sheet. SFAS 160 also requires that the amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. This Statement eliminates the need to apply purchase accounting when a parent company acquires a noncontrolling ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires that, upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net earnings after which any retained noncontrolling interest will be reported at fair value. SFAS 160 requires expanded disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interest of the noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries. SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be applied prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material effect on the Companys statements of operations. Upon adoption of SFAS 160 the non controlling or minority interest ($164.2 million at December 31, 2008) will be reclassified to a component of equity. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)), requiring an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related restructuring costs will be recognized separately. Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date and adjusted prospectively as new information becomes available. When the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. Under SFAS 141(R), all business combinations will be accounted for prospectively by applying the acquisition method, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. SFAS 141(R) is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and will apply to business combinations occurring after the effective date. The Company will adopt SFAS 141R and apply its provisions to business combinations subsequent to December 31, 2008. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company adopted SFAS 157 as of January 1, 2008. Items in our Consolidated Financial Statements for which SFAS 157 is already effective are discussed in the Financing section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, the Company has not yet applied the 28 Table of Contents disclosure requirements of SFAS 157 to certain such nonfinancial assets for which fair value measurements are determined on a non recurring basis only when there is an indication of potential impairment. The fair value hierarchy established by SFAS 157 includes three levels which are based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. In accordance with SFAS 157, our financial assets and liabilities that are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access. Level 2. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on model inputs that are unobservable. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks Market Risk We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In managing exposure to these fluctuations, we may engage in various hedging transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures. On a limited basis, we use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to manage these risks. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity. Our capital costs are directly linked to financial and business risks. We seek to manage the potential negative effects from market volatility and market risk. It is our policy to manage our debt structure in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. Interest Rate Risk We have issued debt in floating rate instruments. Interest rate swaps are used for the purpose of controlling interest expense by managing the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. We do not seek to make a profit from changes in interest rates. We manage interest rate sensitivity by measuring potential increases in interest expense that would result from a probable change in interest rates. When the potential increase in interest expense exceeds an acceptable amount, we reduce risk through the purchase of derivatives. As of December 31, 2008, we are paying interest on the Revolving Loan at LIBOR plus 0.70% and at LIBOR plus 0.88% on our Term Loan A. A one percent increase in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service on the Credit Agreement by $3.9 million (based on principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2008, net of interest rate swaps). The credit rating assigned to FIS by Standard Poors was BB at December 31, 2008. We have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (in millions): Bank Pays FIS pays Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount Variable Rate of(1) Fixed Rate of(2) October 11, 2007 October 11, 2009 $ 1,000.0 1 Month Libor 4.73 % December 11, 2007 December 11, 2009 250.0 1 Month Libor 3.80 % April 11, 2007 April 11, 2010 850.0 1 Month Libor 4.92 % $ 2,100.0 (1) 1.64% in effect at December 31, 2008 under the agreements. (2) In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we pay an applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Term Loan A of 0.88% and the Revolving Loan of 0.70% (plus a facility fee of 0.18%) as of December 31, 2008. 29 Table of Contents We are subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions, such as debt issued, recognized payables and receivables and forecasted transactions. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Our international operations generated approximately $760.0 million in revenues in 2008, of which approximately $614.0 million was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies that we are exposed to are the Brazilian Real, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. A 5% move in average exchange rates for these currencies would have had the following effect on 2008 reported revenues: Impact on Revenues in U.S. Currency Dollars (millions) Real $ 13.0 Euro 10.0 Pound Sterling 4.0 Total Impact $ 27.0 In the future, we may enter into agreements to hedge our risks against foreign currency movements, but historically we have not entered into any such agreements. However, any hedging strategies may not be successful, and any future un hedged foreign exchange payments could be subject to market fluctuations. 30 Table of Contents
