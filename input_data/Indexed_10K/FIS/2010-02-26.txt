Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following section discusses managements view of the financial condition and results of operations of FIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes of FIS included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section. Overview FIS is a leading global provider of banking and payments technology solutions, processing services and information based services. We offer financial institution core processing, card issuer and transaction processing services, including the NYCE Network. FIS is a member of Standard and Poors (SP) 500 Index and consistently holds a leading ranking in the annual FinTech 100 rankings. As of December 31, 2009, FIS has more than 300 solutions serving over 14,000 financial institutions and business customers in over 100 countries spanning all segments of the financial services industry. We have four reporting segments: FSG, PSG, ISG and Corporate and 23 Table of Contents Other. A description of these segments is included above in Item 1. Revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations. Business Trends and Conditions Approximately 85% of our revenue is derived from multiyear agreements and is considered recurring, which provides relative stability to our revenue stream. However, the condition of the overall economy can affect our revenue growth in a number of areas. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees. As a result, lower deposit and card transactions associated with reduced consumer and commercial activity will adversely impact revenue. In addition, sales of software licenses and professional services, which represent approximately 15% of our revenue, can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers and may contract when their capital budgets tighten. In light of the challenging revenue environment, we are seeking to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently. Before consideration of the Metavante acquisition, we reduced both domestic headcount and capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 levels. We completed the Metavante merger on October 1, 2009. The combined Company is positioned to provide a comprehensive range of integrated solutions to its customers, and has greater geographic reach than any other provider in the industry, which will enhance service to the combined companys customers. Management expects to realize cost and revenue synergies over the next twenty four months. As the payment market continues to evolve from paper based to electronic, we continue to add new services responsive to this trend. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card related services. In recent years, we have added a variety of stored value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. The evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud, increasing the demand for our risk management solutions. At the same time, the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and item processing businesses. We compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process in house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of year to year economic changes on our results of operations. One of the current trends we expect to benefit from in the financial services industry is the migration to an outsourced model to improve profitability. Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses. When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services, to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. We believe that we are in the midst of one of the most difficult times that has ever existed for financial institutions, retailers and other businesses in the United States and internationally. We expect a continuation of bank failures in the next few years, which may be offset to a degree by somewhat decreased bank acquisition activity, which traditionally occurs in the banking sector. To date bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred have not been significant to our revenues, however, continuing or escalating bank failures and forced government actions could negatively impact our business. This exposure may be mitigated by incremental revenues we may generate from license fees or services associated with assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial failures. 24 Table of Contents While we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the current financial crisis, there are factors outside our control that might impact our operating results that we may not be able to fully anticipate as to timing and severity, including but not limited to adverse effects if banks are nationalized, or if global economic conditions worsen, causing further slowdowns in consumer spending and lending. Further, there could be an impact on our ability to access capital should any of our lenders fail. For an update on our Brazil card processing venture, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing, credit and debit card processing services, other payment processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services and products. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. We are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $41.8 million and $40.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Reserves for Check Guarantee Losses In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writers bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the checks face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates. 25 Table of Contents Historically, such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain, and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our customers, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $83.3 million and $115.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. A ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2009 could impact 2009 net earnings by less than $2.0 million after tax. Computer Software Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, computer software, net of accumulated amortization, was $932.7 million and $617.0 million, respectively. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life, ranging from 3 to 10 years. In determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate. Amortization expense for computer software was $149.8 million, $149.9 million and $164.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was amortization expense on computer software of $14.8 million and $32.5 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. While we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. We generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the assets useful life is no longer indefinite. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The authoritative guidance requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the units net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets did indicate an impairment of certain trademarks which are being discontinued as a result of the Companys rebranding campaign 26 Table of Contents initiated on October 1, 2009 following the acquisition of Metavante. Accordingly we recorded a pre tax charge of $124.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $52.0 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated fair value and included approximately $26.0 million of this charge in discontinued operations. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the Statement of Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However, final determination of prior year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made. Related Party Transactions We are a party to certain historical related party agreements with FNF, LPS and other related parties (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report). Factors Affecting Comparability Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions: On October 1, 2009, we acquired Metavante in a tax free reorganization. Each outstanding share of Metavante common stock was converted into 1.35 shares, or approximately 163.6 million total shares, of FIS common stock. Outstanding Metavante stock options and other stock based awards were converted into FIS stock options and stock based awards using the same exchange ratio. The results of operations and financial position of Metavante are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from and after the date of acquisition. On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin off. The results of operations of the Lender Processing Services segment through the July 2, 2008 spin off date are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. On September 12, 2007, we acquired eFunds. eFunds provided risk management, EFT services, prepaid/gift card processing, and global outsourcing solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and internationally. In connection with this acquisition, we borrowed an additional $1.6 billion under our bank credit facilities. The results of operations and financial position of eFunds are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from and after the date of acquisition. On August 31, 2007, we completed the sale of one of our subsidiaries, Property Insight, to FNF, for $95.0 million in cash, realizing a pre tax gain of $66.9 million ($42.1 million after tax) which is reported as a 27 Table of Contents discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings. Property Insight was a leading provider of title plant services to FNF, as well as to various national and regional title insurance underwriters. Property Insight primarily managed, maintained, and updated the title insurance plants that are owned by FNF. On July 3, 2007, we sold our 29% interest in Covansys to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) by exchanging our remaining 6.9 million shares of stock and 4.0 million warrants in Covansys for cash. We realized a pre tax gain on sales of Covansys securities of $274.5 million in 2007. As a result of the above transactions, the results of operations in the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be directly comparable. Consolidated Results of Operations (in millions, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Processing and services revenues $ 3,769.5 $ 3,427.7 $ 2,892.9 Cost of revenues 2,800.6 2,689.3 2,315.3 Gross profit 968.9 738.4 577.6 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 554.1 388.6 302.5 Impairment charges 136.9 26.0 13.5 Operating income 277.9 323.8 261.6 Other income (expense): Interest income 3.4 6.3 3.0 Interest expense (134.0 ) (163.5 ) (190.2 ) Gain on sale of investment in Covansys 274.5 Other income (expense), net 8.7 1.5 14.8 Total other income (expense) (121.9 ) (155.7 ) 102.1 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities 156.0 168.1 363.7 Provision for income taxes 52.1 53.3 128.4 Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities (0.2 ) 2.8 Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax 103.9 114.6 238.1 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax 4.6 104.9 323.0 Net earnings 108.5 219.5 561.1 Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (2.6 ) (4.7 ) 0.1 Net earnings attributable to FIS $ 105.9 $ 214.8 $ 561.2 Net earnings per share basic from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders $ 0.43 $ 0.58 $ 1.23 Net earnings per share basic from discontinued operations attributable to FIS common stockholders 0.02 0.54 1.68 Net earnings per share basic attributable to FIS common stockholders $ 0.45 $ 1.12 $ 2.91 Weighted average shares outstanding basic 236.4 191.6 193.1 28 Table of Contents 2009 2008 2007 Net earnings per share diluted from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders $ 0.42 $ 0.57 $ 1.21 Net earnings per share diluted from discontinued operations attributable to FIS common stockholders 0.02 0.54 1.65 Net earnings per share diluted attributable to FIS common stockholders $ 0.44 $ 1.11 $ 2.86 Weighted average shares outstanding diluted 239.4 193.5 196.5 Amounts attributable to FIS common stockholders: Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax $ 101.3 $ 110.5 $ 237.2 Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax 4.6 104.3 324.0 Net earnings attributable to FIS $ 105.9 $ 214.8 $ 561.2 Processing and Services Revenues Processing and services revenues totaled $3,769.5 million, $3,427.7 million and $2,892.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in revenue during 2009 of $341.8 million, or 10.0% as compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to the impact of the Metavante acquisition, which contributed fourth quarter revenues of $404.1 million, partially offset by $53.7 million in unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and other items referred to in the segment discussion below. The increase in revenue during 2008 of $534.8 million, or 18.5% as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the eFunds acquisition, which contributed year over year incremental revenues of $396.3 million. Additionally our Brazilian card processing venture, the (Brazilian Venture) had a year over year increase in revenue of $87.7 million for 2008. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of revenues totaled $2,800.6 million, $2,689.3 million and $2,315.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $968.9 million, $738.4 million and $577.6 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 25.7%, 21.5% and 20.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues of $111.3 million in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above. The increase in gross margin of 420 basis points for 2009 over 2008 was driven by the Companys continued effort to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency, coupled with the initial results from the synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante merger. The increase in cost of revenues of $374.0 million in the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period is directly attributable to revenue growth across our three operating segments. The increase in gross margin of 150 basis points for 2008 over 2007 was driven by the growth of higher margin sales and gained efficiencies relating to the integration of eFunds. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $554.1 million, $388.6 million and $302.5 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase of $165.5 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to: (a) restructuring, integration and merger related charges, including professional and advisory fees, severance, incentive bonuses and lease adjustments contributing $108.5 million of the year over year increase and (b) incremental costs associated with the Metavante acquisition. Stock based compensation increased from $51.6 million in 2008 to $71.0 million in 2009. Stock based compensation in the 2009 period included vesting acceleration charges of $29.2 million due to change in control provisions triggered by the Metavante acquisition and $4.5 million for new merger related grants. By comparison, the 2008 period included charges of $14.1 million for the accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds employees assumed in the eFunds acquisition and $2.6 million relating to the acceleration, upon termination, of certain unvested executive stock awards. The increase of $86.1 million in 2008 as 29 Table of Contents compared to 2007 primarily relates to the incremental costs from the eFunds acquisition, as well as increased stock compensation costs, additional restructuring and integration charges, and charges associated with the LPS spin off. Stock based compensation increased from $24.9 million in 2007 to $51.6 million in 2008. The $26.7 million increase in stock based compensation is mainly attributable to the 2008 acceleration charges noted above. The remaining increase is attributable to $21.0 million of additional restructuring and integration charges and $9.3 million in charges associated with the spin off of LPS as compared to $6.0 million and $0.5 million of such charges, respectively in 2007. Impairment Charges Impairment charges totaled $136.9 million, $26.0 million and $13.5 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 charges relate primarily to the introduction of a new brand identity in conjunction with the Metavante merger, giving rise to the impairment of a number of previously acquired trademarks. The 2009 period also included charges related to impairment of certain capitalized software assets totaling approximately $12.9 million. The 2008 period included charges of $26.0 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated fair value. The 2007 period included impairment charges of $13.5 million to write off impaired software assets. Operating Income Operating income totaled $277.9 million, $323.8 million and $261.6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) was 7.4%, 9.4% and 9.0% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for 2009 as compared to the 2008 and 2007 periods is primarily attributable to the impairment charges noted above and increased restructuring, integration and merger related charges relating to the Metavante acquisition. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $134.0 million, $163.5 million and $190.2 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease of $29.5 million in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 results from: (a) lower interest rates on our debt; (b) a $9.3 million make whole premium in 2008 on the redemption of the eFunds Notes; and (c) the $12.4 million write off of debt issuance costs in 2008 associated with the Term Loan B retired in conjunction with the LPS spin off. The decrease of $26.7 million in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 is the result of a reduction of $1.6 billion in debt associated with the LPS spin off on July 2, 2008 and the inclusion of $27.2 million in write offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our prior credit facility during 2007, partially offset by the 2008 write off of debt issuance costs noted in (c) above. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $52.1 million, $53.3 million and $128.4 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 33.4%, 31.7% and 35.3% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net change in the 2009 period overall effective tax rate is primarily related to the impact of the LPS spin off in the 2008 period. The decrease in tax expense for the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period is attributable to the 2007 gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants, partially offset by increased operating income in the 2008 period. The decrease in the 2008 overall effective tax rate is primarily related to state tax benefits and benefits related to research and development credits. Additionally, our overall effective tax rate is lower than the effective statutory rates driven in part by the impact of our international operations. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to FIS Common Stockholders Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled $101.3 million, $110.5 million and $237.2 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, or $0.42, $0.57 and $1.21 per diluted share, respectively, due to the factors described above. 30 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Financial Solutions Group 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Processing and services revenues $ 1,260.0 $ 1,135.8 $ 979.6 Operating income $ 417.7 $ 352.2 $ 182.1 Operating margin 33.2 % 31.0 % 18.6 % Revenues for FSG totaled $1,260.0 million, $1,135.8 million and $979.6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall segment increase of $124.2 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted primarily from incremental fourth quarter Metavante revenues of $154.2 million, partially offset by lower software license and professional services revenue. The overall segment increase of $156.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition that occurred on September 12, 2007 and organic growth within our existing business. Incremental revenue from the eFunds acquisition contributed a year over year increase of $143.3 million. Operating income for FSG totaled $417.7 million, $352.2 million and $182.1 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 33.2%, 31.0% and 18.6% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily resulted from the fourth quarter impact of the Metavante acquisition and increased operating margins due to current year targeted cost reductions. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily resulted from increased operating margins due to targeted cost reductions coupled with the relatively higher margin on the additional revenues from the eFunds acquisition. Payment Solutions Group 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Processing and services revenues $ 1,741.9 $ 1,526.3 $ 1,303.2 Operating income $ 475.6 $ 353.8 $ 291.8 Operating margin 27.3 % 23.2 % 22.4 % Revenues for PSG totaled $1,741.9 million, $1,526.3 million and $1,303.2 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall segment increase of $215.6 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted primarily from incremental fourth quarter Metavante revenues of $258.1 million, partially offset by reduced termination fees and lower item processing, prepaid card and retail check activity. The overall segment increase of $223.1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition, which contributed year over year incremental revenue of $210.5 million. Operating income for PSG totaled $475.6 million, $353.8 million and $291.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 27.3%, 23.2% and 22.4% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period primarily resulted from increased operating efficiencies and targeted cost reductions. International Solutions Group 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Processing and services revenues $ 782.7 $ 768.1 $ 613.7 Operating income $ 114.2 $ 68.7 $ 57.3 Operating margin 14.6 % 8.9 % 9.3 % 31 Table of Contents Revenues for ISG totaled $782.7 million, $768.1 million and $613.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall segment increase of $14.6 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily resulted from an increase in core processing revenue driven by strong services revenue and volumes in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions and payments revenue driven by organic growth across all regions and nominal incremental revenues from Metavante, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of $53.7 million. The overall segment increase of $154.4 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily resulted from increased revenue in our Brazilian Venture and incremental revenues due to the eFunds acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of $28.2 million. The Brazilian Venture had a 2008 year over year increase in revenues of $87.7 million and the eFunds acquisition contributed year over year incremental revenue of $41.5 million. Operating income for ISG totaled $114.2 million, $68.7 million and $57.3 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating margin was 14.6%, 8.9% and 9.3% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in operating income and margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily results from improved scale and efficiencies within operations. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were $729.6 million, $450.9 million and $269.6 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $278.7 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to the restructuring, integration and merger related charges, impairment charges to trademarks and certain capitalized software assets and incremental costs associated with the Metavante acquisition as addressed above under total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Impairment Charges. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $181.3 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 is attributable to the effect of incremental expenses related to the eFunds acquisition, additional stock based compensation expense, incremental restructuring and integration charges and costs associated with the LPS spin off. The significant components of the 2008 variance as compared to 2007 are also addressed above under total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Impairment Charges. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures, stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $430.9 million and debt of $3,253.3 million, including the current portion. Of the $430.9 million cash and cash equivalents, approximately $195.4 million is held by our operations in foreign jurisdictions. We expect that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt. We currently pay a $0.05 per common share dividend on a quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share is payable March 30, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2010. Cash Flows from Operations Cash flows from operations were $714.1 million, $596.4 million and $463.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively. Cash flows from operations in 2008 include cash flows from LPS of $136.7 million. Excluding the 2008 impact of LPS, cash flows from operations increased by $254.4 million due to higher earnings before 32 Table of Contents consideration of the impairment charges, better working capital management during the 2009 period and the collection of $73.5 million of receivables retained after the sale of Certegy Australia Ltd. Cash flows from operations for 2007 were reduced by tax liability payments of $106.6 million relating to the gain on sale of our investment in Covansys and a $47.5 million reduction in taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Capital Expenditures Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We spent approximately $212.5 million, $255.4 million and $343.3 million on capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively, including approximately $25.4 million during the 2008 period related to discontinued operations including LPS prior to the spin off. We expect to spend approximately 5% 6% of 2010 revenue on capital expenditures. Financing On January 18, 2007, we entered into a five year syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the FIS Credit Agreement). The FIS Credit Agreement provides total committed capital of $3,000.0 million comprised of $2,100.0 million of term notes (the Term Loan A) and $900.0 million of revolving capacity (the Revolving Loan). The Revolving Loan is bifurcated into two tranches; a $165.0 million tranche that allows borrowings in U.S. Dollars only and a $735.0 million multicurrency tranche that allows borrowings in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds Sterling, and Australian Dollars. The multicurrency tranche of the Revolving Loan includes a sublimit of $250.0 million for swing line loans and a $250.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. In addition, the FIS Credit Agreement originally provided for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $600.0 million. To facilitate our acquisition of eFunds, on July 30, 2007, we executed an amendment to the FIS Credit Agreement to increase the permitted maximum principal of uncommitted incremental loans from $600.0 million to $2,100.0 million and converted the facility from unsecured to secured. On September 12, 2007, the amendment became effective, and we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain $1,600.0 million of term loans (the Term Loan B). On July 2, 2008, in conjunction with the spin off of Lender Processing Services, Inc., $1,585.0 million, the then outstanding principal balance of Term Loan B was retired. On November 1, 2007, Metavante entered into a credit agreement (the MV Credit Agreement) for an aggregate principal amount of $2,000.0 million comprised of $1,750.0 million of seven year term loans (the MV Term Loan) and a six year revolving capacity of $250.0 million (the MV Revolving Loan). Immediately preceding the merger of FIS and Metavante, the outstanding balances of the MV Term Loan and MV Revolving Loan were $1,723.8 million and $0, respectively. On October 1, 2009, contemporaneous with the closing of the Metavante merger, FIS obtained $500.0 million of term loans (the Term Loan C), utilizing the $500.0 million of remaining uncommitted incremental loans under the September 12, 2007 amendment of the FIS Credit Agreement. FIS exchanged the $500.0 million of Term Loan C for $500.0 million of the MV Term Loan (which portion was subsequently cancelled). In addition, on October 1, 2009, FIS purchased $423.8 million of the remaining MV Term Loan, which loans were deemed to be contemporaneously cancelled. After giving effect to the exchange, purchase and cancellation, the aggregate principal amount of the MV Term Loan outstanding as of October 1, 2009 was $800.0 million. Also on October 1, 2009, FIS entered into an agreement to sell certain of its accounts receivable (the AR Facility) to a wholly owned special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the SPV), which is exclusively engaged in purchasing receivables from FIS. The SPV funds its purchases, in part, by selling interests in the accounts receivables to a syndicate of financial institution purchasers in exchange for up to $145.0 million in capital funding (provided, however, that if FIS obtains additional commitments from new or existing purchasers, the aggregate amount may be increased by up to an additional $55.0 million, to an overall aggregate capital amount of $200.0 million). The sales to the purchasers do not qualify for sale treatment as we maintain effective control over the receivables that are sold. Thus, the SPV is included in our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2009, there was no outstanding capital under the accounts receivable facility. 33 Table of Contents We may borrow, repay and re borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the Revolving Loan. We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A of $52.5 million per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of $1.522.5 million payable on January 18, 2012. As of December 31, 2009, there are no longer any mandatory quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan C as these requirements have been fulfilled in full due to principal prepayments made during the quarter ended December 31, 2009. The remaining principal balance of the Term Loan C is payable on January 18, 2012. We must make quarterly principal payments on the MV Term Loan in the amount of $2.0 million on the first business day of each February, May, August, and November with the balance of $759.4 million payable on November 1, 2014. The following table summarizes the mandatory annual principal payments on the FIS Credit Agreement and MV Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): Term A Term C MV Term Loan Loan Loan Total 2010 $ 210.0 $ $ 8.1 $ 218.1 2011 157.5 8.1 165.6 2012 1,522.5 200.0 8.1 1,730.6 2013 8.1 8.1 2014 765.6 765.6 Total $ 1,890.0 $ 200.0 $ 798.0 $ 2,888.0 The FIS Credit Agreement, MV Credit Agreement, and AR Facility are subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the credit facilities at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, one financial institution that was a lender under one of our credit facilities had failed, thereby reducing the amount of revolving capacity available to us under our Revolving Loan by an immaterial amount. No other financial institutions that are lenders under any of our credit facilities have failed to date. We continue to monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan and AR Facility are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions both domestic and international. The combined commitments of our top 10 lenders comprise about 67% of our Revolving Loan and AR Facility. The failure of any single lender to perform their obligations under the Revolving Loan and or the AR Facility would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations. If the single largest lender were to simultaneously default under the terms of both the FIS Credit Agreement (impacting the capacity of the Revolving Loan) and the AR Facility, the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn portion of these agreements would be about $117.6 million. As of December 31, 2009, the combined undrawn capacity of the Revolving Loan and the AR Facility was $703.4 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (see Item 7A). Private Placement Investment On October 1, 2009, pursuant to an investment agreement with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL) and FNF dated as of March 31, 2009, FIS issued and sold (a) to THL in a private placement 12.9 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200.0 million and (b) to FNF in a private placement 3.2 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.0 million. FIS paid each of THL and FNF a transaction fee equal to 3% of their respective investments. The investment agreement provides that neither THL nor FNF may transfer the shares purchased in the investments, subject to limited exceptions, for 180 days after the closing. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations FIS long term contractual obligations generally include its long term debt and operating lease payments on certain of its property and equipment. The following table summarizes FIS significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 236.7 $ 179.7 $ 2,066.6 $ 8.1 $ 765.7 $ $ 3,256.8 (1) Operating leases 73.2 56.3 39.1 28.0 19.3 71.1 287.0 Data processing and maintenance and purchase commitments 125.6 54.3 43.1 33.4 33.4 85.7 375.5 Total $ 435.5 $ 290.3 $ 2,148.8 $ 69.5 $ 818.4 $ 156.8 $ 3,919.3 (1) Does not take into account $3.5 million fair value discount recorded for Metavante Term Loan. FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS expected short term liquidity needs and its long term needs for the operations of its business, expected capital spending for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements FIS does not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance requiring an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related restructuring costs are to be recognized separately. When the fair value of assets acquired exceeds the fair value of consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. All business combinations will be accounted for prospectively by applying the acquisition method, including combinations among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. In April 2009, the FASB amended and clarified the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and related disclosures arising from contingencies in a business combination. Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period. If fair value cannot be determined, the existing guidance for contingencies and other authoritative literature should be followed. This new guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and applies to business combinations occurring after the effective date. The Company has applied the provisions to the Metavante combination, and will apply the provisions prospectively for any future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance relative to noncontrolling interests (sometimes called minority interests), requiring: (1) that noncontrolling interests be presented as a component of equity on the balance sheet; (2) that the amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings; and (3) expanded disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interests of the non controlling owners of subsidiaries. The Company adopted the presentation and disclosure requirements as of January 1, 2009, with retrospective application for all periods presented. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for transfers and servicing of financial assets. The primary changes include: (1) the elimination of the qualified special purpose entity concept, and the exception that allowed many transferors to deconsolidate such entities; (2) a new participating interest definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting; (3) clarification and amendments 35 Table of Contents to the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale; (4) a change to the amount of recognized gain/loss on a transfer accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor; and (5) enhanced disclosure requirements. This new guidance will be applied prospectively to new transfers of financial assets occurring in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. In June 2009, the FASB issued new consolidation guidance for variable interest entities (VIEs). It requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary (or consolidator) of a VIE based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The new guidance changes the consideration of kick out rights in determining if an entity is a VIE which may cause certain additional entities to be considered VIEs. It also requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary, and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2010 for calendar year end companies. There is no grandfathering of previous consolidation conclusions. As a result, any existing VIEs at date of adoption must be re evaluated. The Company currently has no unconsolidated VIEs; thus, this new guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In August 2009, the FASB issued guidance to amend Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. The update addresses practice difficulties caused by the tension between fair value measurements based on the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such transfers from taking place. The guidance prescribes using the quoted price in an active market for an identical liability when traded as an asset to assign a fair value to debt. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after August 27, 2009, and applies to all required fair value measurements of liabilities. No new fair value measurements are required by the standard. The Companys methodology for assessing and reporting the fair value of outstanding debt is consistent with that prescribed by this guidance. In September 2009, the FASB amended ASC Subtopic 605 25, Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (VSOE) or Third Party Evidence (TPE) of standalone selling price before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that have been delivered. In the absence of VSOE or TPE of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement, entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements. The overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element (both delivered and undelivered items) based on their relative selling prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or TPE or are based on the entitys estimated selling price. Application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of this new guidance. Additional disclosure will be required about multiple element revenue arrangements, as well as qualitative and quantitative disclosure about the effect of the change. The amendment is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted at the beginning of a fiscal year or applied retrospectively to the beginning of a fiscal year. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2010. The effect of the change for FIS will be a function of the new contracts entered into or materially modified after adoption, and relates primarily to arrangements that include software licenses with other service elements. Management expects this guidance to result in a modest increase in revenue in the year of adoption related to revenue that would have been deferred under the existing authoritative literature. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks Market Risk We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity. 36 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk At the present time, our only material market risk sensitive instruments are our debt and related interest rate swaps. We have issued debt that bears interest at floating rates. We use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense on the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. We manage interest rate sensitivity by measuring potential increases in interest expense that would result from a probable change in interest rates. When the potential increase in interest expense exceeds an acceptable amount, we reduce risk through the purchase of derivatives. As of December 31, 2009, we are paying interest on our Term Loan A at LIBOR plus 0.88%, on our Metavante Term Loan at LIBOR plus 3.25%, on our Term Loan C at LIBOR plus 4.25%, and on our Revolving Loan at LIBOR plus 0.70%. An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service under the FIS Credit Agreement, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $7.0 million (based on principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009). We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of December 31, 2009, less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt. This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of December 31, 2009 and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts on the Revolving Loan and Term Loan A outstanding as of December 31, 2008, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $3.9 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (in millions): Bank Pays FIS pays Effective Date Termination Date Notional Amount Variable Rate of Fixed Rate of April 11, 2007 April 11, 2010 $ 850.0 1 Month Libor(4) 4.92%(5) April 11, 2010 April 11, 2011 200.0 1 Month Libor(4) 0.76%(5) October 20, 2009 April 20, 2011 400.0 1 Month Libor(4) 0.99%(5) October 20, 2009 April 20, 2011 300.0 1 Month Libor(4) 0.99%(5) February 1, 2010 May 1, 2011 250.0 1 Month Libor(4) 0.75%(5) February 1, 2010 May 1, 2011 150.0 1 Month Libor(4) 0.74%(5) December 11, 2009 June 13, 2011 200.0 1 Month Libor(4) 0.91%(5) February 1, 2008 February 1, 2012 600.0 (1) 3 Month Libor(2) 3.87%(3) February 1, 2008 February 1, 2012 200.0 3 Month Libor(2) 3.44%(3) $ 3,150.0 (1) Notional value amortizes to $400.0 million on February 1, 2010 and $200.0 million on February 1, 2011. (2) 0.25% in effect at December 31, 2009. (3) In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we currently pay an applicable margin of 3.25%. These swaps were acquired in the Metavante merger. While the payments are fixed, interest expense associated with these swaps is recorded based on the floating rate curve established as of the acquisition date. (4) 0.23% in effect at December 31, 2009. (5) In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we currently pay an applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Term Loan A of 0.88%, Term Loan C of 4.25% and the Revolving Loan of 0.70% (plus a facility fee of 0.18%) as of December 31, 2009. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value 37 Table of Contents measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2 type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps. Foreign Currency Risk Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks arises from our non U.S. operations generally, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our international operations generated approximately $782.7 million in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009, of which approximately $605.1 million was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies that we are exposed to are the Brazilian Real, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have had the following effects on our reported revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): Currency 2009 2008 Real $ 28.2 $ 26.0 Euro 19.1 19.6 Pound Sterling 6.4 8.4 Total Impact $ 53.7 $ 54.0 The impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10% change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant. Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes. 38
