Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following section discusses managements view of the financial condition and results of operations of FIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes of FIS included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section. Overview FIS is one of the worlds largest global providers dedicated to banking and payments technologies. We offer financial institution core proce ssing, card issuer and transaction processing services, including the NYCE Network. FIS is a member of Standard and Poors (S&P) 500&reg; Index and consistently holds a leading ranking in the annual FinTech 100 rankings. As of December 31, 2010, FIS has more than 300 solutions serving over 14,000 financial institutions and business customers in over 100 countries spanning all segments of the financial services industry. We have four reporting segments: FSG, PSG, ISG and Corporate and Other. A description of these segments is included above in Item 1. Revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations. Business Trends and Conditions Approximately 85% of our revenue historically is considered recurring, which provides relative stability to our revenue stream. However, the condition of the overall economy can affect our revenue growth in a number of areas. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees. As a result, lower deposit and card transactions associated with reduced consumer and commercial activity will adversely impact revenue. In addition, sales of soft ware licenses and professional services, which have represented approximately 15% of our revenue, can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers and may contract when their capital budgets tighten. In light of the challenging revenue environment, we have been seeking to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently. We completed the Metavante Technologies, Inc. acquisition (the "Metavante Acquisition") on October 1, 2009. The combined Company is positioned to provide a comprehensive range of integrated solutions to its customers, and has greater geographic reach than any other provider in the industry, which will enhance service to the combined Companys customers. Management expects to continue to realize incremental cost and revenue syner gies through 2011 as a result of the Metavante Acquisition. However, the impact of these synergies on year over year trends for 2011 vs. 2010 will be less. We acquired Capco in December 2010 to broaden our capabilities to provide strategic consulting. While this will generate increased revenues, the lower profit margins realized for professional services as compared to our other solutions will result in some level of profit margin compression. The addition of Capco will also reduce the relative proportion of our recurring revenue stream in 2011. As the payment market continues to evolve from paper based to electronic, we continue to add new services responsive to this trend. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card related services. In recent years, we have added a variety of stored value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. The evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud, increasing the demand for our risk management so lutions. At the same time, the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and item processing businesses. We compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process in house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of year to year economic changes on our results of operations. One of the current trends we expect to benefit from in the financial services industry is the migration to an outsourced model to improve profitabili ty.24Table of Contents Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses. When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. While we are cautious regarding broader economic improvement, we expect banks to continue investing in new technology and believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the over all market continues to recover. We expect bank failures to continue in the next few years, and have recently seen increased bank consolidation activity and expect this to continue in 2011. To date, bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred have not been significant to our revenues; however, continuing or escalating bank failures and forced government actions could negatively impact our business. This exposure may be mitigated by incremental revenues we may generate from license fees or services associated with assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial failures. For an update on our Brazilian outsourced card processing venture (the "Brazilian Venture"), see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual a mounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing, credit and debit card processing services, other payment processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services and products. Reven ues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. We are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However, the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or cla sses of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and c ollection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $33.1 million and $41.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Reserves for Check Guarantee Losses In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writers bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the checks face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis 25Table of Contentsof our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates. Historically, such estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our customers, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $69.4 million and $83.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. A ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2010 would have impacted 2010 net earnings by less than $2.0 million after tax. Computer Software Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, computer software, net of accumulated amortization , was $909.0 million and $932.7 million, respectively. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life. In determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate. Useful lives for all computer software range from 3 to 10 years. Amortization expense for computer software was $195.1 million, $149.8 million and $149.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was amortization expense on computer software of $3.3 million, $0.7 million and $15.3 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. While we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. We generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the assets useful life is n o longer indefinite. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The authoritative guidance requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach utilizes earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies . If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumpti ons regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 26Table of Contentsand other assumptions. Du ring the year ended December 31, 2010, the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the Brazilian Venture that was attributable to Banco Santander was deemed impaired due to the exit of Banco Santander. Accordingly, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $140.3 million in the third quarter of 2010. In addition, we recorded a $5.2 million impairment of intangible assets related to the discontinued operations of Participacoes, as discussed in Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets indicated an impairment of certain trademarks which were discontinued as a result of the Companys rebranding campaign initiated on October 1, 2009, following the acquisition of Metavante. Accordingly, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $124.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $52.0 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated fair value and included approximately $26.0 million of this charge in discontinued operations. Given the significance of our goodwil l and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items f or income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual pre tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies . We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However, final determination of prior year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made. Related Party Transactions We are a party to certain historical related party agreements with FNF, LPS and other related parties (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report). Factors Affecting Comparability Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions: &bull; In August 2010, we completed a leveraged recapitalization. Through a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, we repurchased 86.2 million shares of our common stock, including 6.4 million shares underlying previously unexercised stock options. The repurchased shares were added to treasury stock. The recapitalization was funded by incremental debt, as outlined under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing". &bull; On October 1, 2009, we acquired Metavante in a tax free reorganization. Each outstanding share of Metavante common stock was converted into 1.35 shares, or approximately 163.6 million total shares, of FIS common stock. Outstanding Metavante stock options and other stock based awards were converted into FIS stock options and stock based awards using the same exchange ratio. The result s of operations and financial position of Metavante are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition.&bull; On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin off. The results of operations of the Lender Processing Services segment through the July 2, 2008, spin off date are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all periods presented. As a result of the above transactions, the results of operations and earnings per share in the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be directly comparable.27Table of Contents 28Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations(in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008Processing and services revenues$5,269.5 $3,711.1 $3,359.5 Cost of revenues3,637.7 2,741.5 2,616.1 Gross profit1,631.8 969.6 743.4 Selling, general, an d administrative expenses675.8 547.1 381.0 Impairment charges154.9 136.9 26.0 Operating income801.1 285.6 336.4 Other income (expense): Interest income6.4 3.4 6.3 Interest expense(179.7) (134.0) (163.4)Other income (expense), net(11.5) 8.7 1.5 Total other income (expense)(184.8) (121.9) (155.6)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities616.3 163.7 180.8 Provision for income taxes215.3 54.7 57.6 Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities&mdash; &mdash; (0.2)Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax401.0 109.0 123.0 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(43.1) (0.5) 96.5 Net earnings357.9 108.5 219.5 Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest46.6 (2.6) (4.7)Net earnings attributable to FIS$404.5 $105.9 $214.8 Net earnings per share &mdash; basic from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.30 $0.45 $0.62 Net earnings (loss) per share &mdash; basic from discontinued operations attributable to FIS common stockholders(0.12) (0.00) 0.50 Net earnings per share &mdash; basic attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.17 $0.45 $1.12 Weighted average shares outstanding &mdash; basic345.1 236.4 191.6 Net earnings per share &mdash; diluted from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.27 $0.44 $0.61 Net earnings (loss) per share &mdash; diluted from discontinued operations attributable to FIS common stockholders(0.12) (0.00) 0.50 Net earnings per share &mdash; diluted attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.15 $0.44 $1.11 Weighted average shares outstanding &mdash; diluted352.0 239.4 193.5 Amounts attributable to FIS common stockholders: Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax$447.6 $106.4 $118.9 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(43.1) (0.5) 95.9 Net earnings attributable to FIS$404.5 $105.9 $214.8 Processing and Services Revenues Processing and services revenues totaled $5,269.5 million, $3,711.1 million and $3,359.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in revenue during 2010 of $1,558.4 million, or 42.0%, as compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the Metavante Acquisition and to a lesser extent the recognition of an $83.3 million termination fee in connection with Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture, revenue derived from 2010 acquisit ions of $23.4 million, and a favorable foreign currency impact of $26.4 million resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar. These increases were partially offset by declines in our paper based retail check businesses. The increase in revenue during 2009 of $351.6 million, or 10.5%, as compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to the impact of the Metavante Acquisition, which contributed fourth quarter revenues of $404.1&nb sp;million, partially offset by $53.7 million in unfavorable foreign currency impact resulting from a 29Table of Contentsstrengthening of the U.S. Dollar and other items referred to in the segment discussion below. Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Cost of revenues totaled $3,637.7 million, $2,741.5 million and $2,616.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $1,631.8 million, $969.6 million and $743.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 31.0%, 26.1% and 22.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues of $896.2 million in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above. The increase in gross margin of 490 basis points for 2010 over 2009 was driven by the termination fee received in connection with Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture, as well as the continuing results from the cost synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante Acquisition. The increase in cost of revenues of $125.4 million in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above. The increase in gross margin of 400 basis points for 2009 over 2008 was driven by the Companys continued effort to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency, coupled with the initial results from the cost synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante Acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative Exp enses Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $675.8 million, $547.1 million and $381.0 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase of $128.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to incremental costs associated with the Metavante operations, partially offset by a $10.1 million recovery in the 2010 third quarter of previously incurred legal costs as the result of a favorable court ruling a nd by lower integration and merger related charges and stock based compensation. The increase of $166.1 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to: (a) restructuring, integration and merger related charges, including professional and advisory fees, severance, incentive bonuses and lease adjustments contributing $108.5 million of the year over year increase and (b) incremental costs associated with the Metavante Acquisition. Stock based compensation increased from $51.6 million in 2008 to $71.0 million in 2009. Stock based compensation in the 2009 period included vesting acceleration charges of $29.2 million due to change in control provisions triggered by the Metavante Acquisition and $4.5 million for new merger related grants. By comparison, the 2008 period included charges of $14.1 million for the accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds employees assumed in the eFunds Acquisition and $2.6 million relating to the acceleration, upon termination, of certain unvested executive stock awards. Impairment Charges Impairment charges totaled $154.9 million, $136.9 million and $26.0 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 charges relate to impairments resulting from the exit of Banco Santander from the Brazilian Venture, including $140.3 million representing the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the Brazilian Venture that was attributable to Banco Santander, and the net unamortized balance of $14.6 million for certain capitalized software development costs incurred exclusively for use in processing Banco Santander card activity. The 2009 charges relate primarily to the introduction of a new brand identity in conjunction with the Metavante merger, giving rise to the impairment of a number of previously acquired trademarks. The 2009 period also included charges related to impairment of certain capitalized software assets totaling approximately $12.9 million. The 2008 period included charges of $26.0 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to our retail check business to its estimated f air value. Operating Income Operating income totaled $801.1 million, $285.6 million and $336.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) was 15.2%, 7.7% and 10.0% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in operating margin for 2010 as compared to the 2009 period was driven by termination fees received in connection with Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture, synergies, cost containment initiatives, gross margin improvements and lower stock compensation charges, partially offset by higher integration and merger related charges incurred during the 2010 period. The decrease in operating margin for 2009 as compared to 2008 was driven by the impairment charges noted above and increased restructuring, integration and merger related charges associated with the Metavante Acquisition. To tal Other Income (Expense) Total other income (expense) totaled $(184.8) million, $(121.9) million and $(155.6) million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The two primary components of total other income (expense) are interest expense and, for the 2010 period, costs relating to the leveraged recapitalization. The increase of $45.7 million in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 results from higher overall debt levels as a result of our recapitalization during 2010 and higher interest rates on our debt. The 2010 30Table of Contentsperiod includes $13.7 million of debt extinguishment expenses, the write off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and fees and other expenses relating to our leveraged recapitalization. The 2010 period also includes the forgiveness of $19.4 million of notes payable representing additional consideration which was to be paid to the ba nks in the Brazilian Venture upon migration of their card portfolios and an extinguishment gain of $5.7 million from the restructuring of the remaining Banco Bradesco notes in conjunction with other revisions to the Brazilian Venture agreements (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease of $29.4 million in interest expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted from: (a) lower interest rates on our debt; (b) a $9.3 million make whole premium in 2008 on the redemption of certain eFunds Notes; and (c) the $12.4 million write off of debt issuance costs in 2008 associated with the term loans retired in conjunction with the LPS spin off. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $215.3 million, $54.7 million and $57.6 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This resulted in an effective ta x rate on continuing operations of 34.9%, 33.4% and 31.9% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The net change in the 2010 period overall effective tax rate is primarily related to a larger proportion of domestic pre tax income versus foreign source income due primarily to the Metavante Acquisition, partially offset by the utilization of foreign tax credits. The increase in the 2009 period overall effective tax rate as compared to the 2008 period is primarily related to the impact of the LPS spin off in the 2008 period. Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations During the 2010, 2009 and 2008 periods, certain operations are classified as discontinued. Reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the third quarter of 2010, we determined that we will pursue strategic alternatives for Participacoes. In January 2010, we closed on the sale of ClearPar. In October 2008, we sold Certegy Australia, Ltd. In July 2008, we spun off LPS. The table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for the 2010, 2009 and 2008 periods, net of tax. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2010 2009 2008 Impairment charges Participacoes$(16.6) $&mdash; $&mdash; Impairment charges Certegy Australia&mdash; (18.2) &mdash; Participacoes operations(25.2) (5.1)&nbs p;(8.4)LPS operations&mdash;  &mdash; 112.4 Certegy Australia operations&mdash; 23.9 (12.3)Other(1.3) (1.1) 4.8 Total discontinued operations$(43.1) $(0.5) $96.5 Net (Earnings) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest totaled $46.6 million, $(2.6) million and $(4.7) million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 year included after tax charges totaling $50.1 million relating to the minority partners proportionate share of the write off of capitalized software development costs and of the impairment to the unamortized contract intangible asset resulting from the exit of Banco Santander from the Brazilian Venture. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Stateme nts. Earnings from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax, Attributable to FIS Common Stockholders Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled $447.6 million, $106.4 million and $118.9 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, or $1.27, $0.44 and $0.61 per diluted share, respectively, due to the factors described above. Segment Results of Operations Financial Solutions Group31Table of Contents 2010 2009 2008 (In millions)Processing and services revenues$1,890.8 $1,260.0 $1,135.8 Operating income$670.1 $417.7 $355.7 Operating margin35.4% 33.2% 31.3% Revenues for FSG totaled $1,890.8 million, $1,260.0 million and $1,135.8 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The overall segment increase of $630.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted primarily from incremental Metavante revenues and to a lesser extent increased demand for professional services and software licenses. The overall segment increase of $124.2 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted primarily from incremental fourth quarter Metavante revenues of $154.2 million, partially offset by lower software license and professional services revenue. Operating income for FSG totaled $670.1 million, $417.7&nbs p;million and $355.7 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 35.4%, 33.2% and 31.3% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily resulted from inc remental Metavante 2010 operating income and the increase in operating margin is due to continuing results from the synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante Acquisition. The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily resulted from the fourth quarter impact of the Metavante Acquisition and improved operating margins due to targeted cost reductions. Payment Solutions Group 2010 2009 2008 (In millions)Processing and services revenues$2,478.1 $1,741.9 $1,526.3 Operating income$835.0 $475.6 $353.8 Operating margin33.7% 27.3% 23.2% Revenues for PSG totaled $2,478.1 million, $1,741.9 million and $1,526.3 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The overall segment increase of $736.2 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted primarily from incremental Metavante 2010 revenues. Additionally, growth in electronic payment solutions was offset by lower item processing and retail check activity. The overall segment increase of $215.6 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted primarily from incremental fourth quarter Metavante revenues of $258.1 million, partially offset by reduced termination fees and lower item processing, prepaid card and retail check activity. Operating income for PSG totaled $835.0 million, $475.6 million and $353.8 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 33.7%, 27.3% and 23.2% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in operating income and operating margin in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period primarily resulted from incremental Metavante 2010 operating income and realized cost savings. T he increase in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period primarily resulted from increased operating efficiencies and targeted cost reductions. International Solutions Group 2010 2009 2008 (In millions)Processing and services revenues$917.0  $724.3 $699.9 Operating income$71.1 $121.9 $79.3 Operating margin7.8% 16.8% 11.3% Revenues for ISG totaled $917.0 million, $724.3 million and $699.9 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The overall segment increase of $192.7 million in 2010 as compared to 200 9 resulted from growth driven by increased payment volumes in Brazil, growth in professional services, higher license revenue and incremental revenues from the Metavante Acquisition. The 2010 period also included an $83.3 million termination fee received as a result of Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture and a $26.4 million favorable foreign currency impact resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar during 2010. The overall segment increase of $24.4 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily resulted from an increase in core processing revenue driven by strong services revenue and volumes in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions and payments revenue driven by organic growth across all regions, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of $53.7 million. 32Table of Contents Operating income for ISG totaled $71.1 million, $121.9 million and $79.3 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating margin was 7.8%, 16.8% and 11.3% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in operating income and margin in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from the impairment charges of $154.9 million attributable to Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture previously addressed above under total Company Impairment Charges, partially offset by the $83.3 million termination fee received as a result of Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture. The increase in operating income and margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily results from improved scale and efficiencies within operations. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were $775.1 million, $729.6 million and $452.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $45.5 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily due to the incremental costs associated with the Metavante operations and merger related charges, partially offset by the recovery o f previously incurred legal costs as the result of a favorable court ruling, as addressed above under total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expense. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $277.2 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to the restructuring, integration and merger related charges, impairment charges to trademarks and certain capitalized software assets and incremental costs associated wit h the Metavante Acquisition as addressed above under total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Impairment Charges. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures, stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $338.0 million and debt of $5,192.1 million, including the current portion. Of the $338.0 million cash and cash equivalents, approximately $176.1 million is held by our foreign entities. We expect that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt. We currently pay a $0.05 per common share dividend on a quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share is payable March 31, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 17, 2011. Cash Flows from Operations Cash flows from operations were $1,071.3 million, $714.1 million and $596.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively. Cash flows from operations increased $357.2 million in 2010 primarily due to higher earnings from operations. Cash flows from operations in 2008 include cash flows from LPS of $136.7 million. Excluding the 2008 impact of LPS, cash flows from operations increased in 2009 by $254.4 million due to higher earnings before consideration of the impairment charges, better working capital management during the 2009 period and the collection of $73.5 million of receivables retained after the sale of Certegy Australia Ltd. Capital Expenditures Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We spent approximately $314.0 million, $212.5 million and $255.4 million on capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including approximately $25.4 million during 2008 related to discontinued operations including LPS prior to the spin off. We expect to spend approximately 6% of 2011 revenue on capital expenditures, including integration capital for acquisitions.33Table of Contents Financing On January 18, 2007, FIS entered into a syndicated credit agreement, which was amended on July 30, 2007, and amended and restated on June 29, 2010 (the FIS Credit Agreement). The FIS Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2010, provides total committed capital of $4,781.9 million comprised of: (1) revolving credit facilities in an aggregate maximum principal amount of $1,033.7 million (together, the Revolving Loan), consisting of $112.3 million in revolving credit capacity maturing on January 18, 2012, and $921.4 million in revolving credit capacity maturing on July 18, 2014; (2) an aggregate of $3,748.2 million of term notes consisting of $350.0 million maturing on January 18, 2012 (Term Loan A 1), $1,900.0 million maturing on July 18, 2014 (Term Loan A 2), (3) $1,496.3 million maturing on July 18, 2016 ("Term Loan B") and (4) an aggregate of $1.9 million of term notes (the LCPI Loans) maturing on July 18, 2014. As of December 31, 2010, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan was $305.0 million, with $713.7 million of borrowing capacity remaining thereunder (net of $15.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Loan). See Item 7A for information regarding the interest rates of the loans. On November 1, 2007, Metavante entered into a credit agreement, which was amended on October 1, 2009 (as amended, the MV Credit Agreement). On July 16, 2010, FIS repaid in full the outstanding term loans under the MV Credit Agreement and terminated that credit facility. On October 1, 2009, contemporaneous with the closing of the Metavante merger, FIS obtained $500.0 m illion of term loans (the Term Loan C), which have subsequently been paid in full. Also on October 1, 2009, FIS entered into an agreement to sell certain of its accounts receivable (the AR Facility) to a wholly owned special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the SPV), which was exclusively engaged in purchasing receivables from FIS. FIS maintained effective control over the receivables sold to the SPV. Thus, the SPV is included in our consolidated financial statements. FIS terminated the AR Facility, effective on December 17, 2010, with no further receivables being sold to the SPV as of that date. On July 16, 2010, FIS entered into a Joinder Agreement (the "Joinder Agreement") under which FIS issued a new tranche of term loans under the FIS Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (the "Term Loan B"). The Term Loan B is subject in all material respects to the provisions applicable to other term loans under the FIS Credit Agreement. Interest on the Term Loan B will be generally payable at LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum (with LIBOR subject to a floor of 1.50%). FIS may borrow, repay and re borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until the applicable maturity of the tranches included in the Revolv ing Loan. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A 1 of $11.3 million per quarter from March 31, 2011 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance payable on January 18, 2012. As of December 31, 2010, FIS had made principal prepayments under the Term Loan A 1 of $12.7 million which fully satisfied the required payment obligation of $11.3 million scheduled for March 31, 2011 and reduced the obligation payable on June 30, 2011 by $1.4 million. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A 2 of $50.1 million per quarter from March 31, 2011 through December 31, 2012, and $75.1 million per quarter from March 31, 2013 through March 31, 2014, with the remaining principal balance payable on July 18, 2014. As of December 31, 2010, FIS had made principal prepayments under the Term Loan A 2 of $3.4 million, reducing the payment obligation scheduled for March 31, 2011 by the same amount. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan B of $3.8 million per quarter from March 31, 2011 through June 30, 2016, with the remaining principal balance payable on July 18, 2016. The FIS Credit Agreement is subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the FIS Credit Agreement at December 31, 2010. On July 16, 2010, FIS completed offerings of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"). FIS issued the Notes in two separate series under an indenture dated as of July 16, 2010 among FIS, FIS domestic subsidiaries that guaranteed the FIS Credit Agreement (the "Guarantors") and The Bank of New Yor k Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Notes were offered and sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States to non U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. We have since completed an exchange offer under which we exchanged identical notes that were SEC registered for the Notes.34Table of Contents The following table summarizes the mandatory annual principal payments pursuant to the FIS Credit Agreement and the Notes as of December 31, 2010 (in millions). There are no mandatory principal payments on the Revolving Loan; any balance outstanding on the Revolving Loan will be due and payable at the applicable scheduled maturity date of the respective tranches thereof: TermLoan A 1 TermLoan A 2 TermLoan B 2017Notes 2020Notes Total2011$21.3 $197.0 $15.0 $&mdash; $&mdash; $233.3 2012328.7 200.4 15.0 &mdash; &mdash; 544.1 2013&mdash; 300.4 15.0 &mdash; &mdash; 315.4 2014&mdash; 1,202.2 15.0 &mdash; &mdash; 1,217.2 2015&mdash; &mdash; 15.0 &mdash; &mdash; 15.0 Thereafter&mdash; &mdash; 1,421.3 600.0 500.0 2,521.3 Total$350.0 $1,900.0 $1,496.3 $600.0 $500.0 $4,846.3 We monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions, both domestic and international. The combined commitments of our top 10 lenders comprise about 69% of our Revolving Loan. The failure of any single lender to perform its obligations under the Revolving Loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations. If the single largest lender were to default under the terms of the FIS Credit Agre ement (impacting the capacity of the Revolving Loan), the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Loan, as of December 31, 2010, would be about $105.6 million. As of December 31, 2010, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our term loans from variable to fixed (see Item 7A). Private Placement Investment On October 1, 2009, pursuant to an investment agreement with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL) and FNF dated as of March 31, 2009, FIS issued and sold (a) to THL in a private placement 12.9 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200.0 million and (b) to FNF in a private placement 3.2 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.0 million. FIS paid each of THL and FNF a transaction fee equal to 3% of their respecti ve investments. Contractual Obligations FIS long term contractual obligations generally include its long term debt and operating lease payments on certain of its property and equipment. The following table summarizes FIS significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in millions): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter TotalLong term debt$256.9 $578.7 $315.4 $1,504.8 $15.0 $2,521.3 $5,192.1 Operating leases65.1 47.6 35.7 27.8 24.3 78.1 278.6 Data processing and maintenance and purchase commitments145.5 126.7 117.0 62.9 36.0 66.2 554.3 Total$467.5 $753.0 $468.1 $1,595.5 $75.3 $2,665.6 $6,025.0 FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS expected short term liquidity needs and its long term needs for the operations of its business, expected capital spending for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 35Table of ContentsFIS does not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009 13). This new standard revised the guidance for determining whether multiple deliverables in an arrangement can be separated for revenue recognition and how the consideration should be allocated. It eliminated the use of the residual method of revenue recognition and requires the allocation of consideration to each deliverable using the relative selling price method. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE or TPE is available . FIS early adopted the provisions of ASU 2009 13 prospectively for all new and materially modified arrangements entered into on or after January 1, 2010. See also Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks Market Risk We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity.Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps. The Notes represent substantially all of our fixed rate long term debt obligations. The carrying value of the Notes was $1,100.0 million at December 31, 2010. The fair value of the Notes was approximately $1,172.3 million at December 31, 2010. The potential reduction in fair value of the Notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase the Notes before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our floating rate long term debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the FIS Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2010, we are paying interest on our Term Loan A 1 of LIBOR plus 1.00%, on our Term Loan A 2 of LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 2.50% based upon the Companys leverage ratio as defined in the FIS Credit Agreement, and on our Term Loan B at generally LIBOR plus 3.75% (with LIBOR subject to a 1.50% floor). Prior to the June 29, 2010 amendment and extension, interest on the Revolving Loan was payable at LIBOR plus up to 1.00% (Eurocurrency Borrowings), Fed funds plus up to 1.00% (Swingline Bor rowings) or Prime plus 0.00% (Base Rate Borrowings) plus a facility fee of up to 0.25%. The pre amendment pricing continues to apply for the portion of the Revolving Loan that matures in January 2012, consisting of approximately $112.3 million of commitments. Interest on the portion of the Revolving Loan that matures in July 2014 is generally payable at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 2.50%, based upon the Companys leverage ratio, and is subject to an unused commitment fee of 0.50%. An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service under these credit agreements, after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $3.4 million (based on principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2010). We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our float ing rate debt as of December 31, 2010, less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt. This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of December 31, 2010, and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts on the Revolving Loan and Term Loan A outstanding as of December 31, 2009, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $7.0 million. We use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2010, we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (in millions): 36Table of ContentsEffective DateTermination Date Notional Amount Bank Pays Variable Rate of FIS pays Fixed Rate ofApril 12, 2010April 11, 2011 $200.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.76% (4)October 20, 2009April 20, 2011 700.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.99% (4)February 1, 2010May 1, 2011 250.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.75% (4)February 1, 2010May 1, 2011 150.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.74% (4)December 11, 2009June 13, 2011 200.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.91% (4)February 1, 2008February 1, 2012 400.0 (1) 3 Month Libor (3) 3.87% (4)February 1, 2008February 1, 2012 200.0 3 Month Libor (3) 3.44% (4)November 1, 2010November 1, 2012 150.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.50% (4)February 1, 2011February 1, 2013 200.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.62% (4)May 3, 2011May 1, 2013 400.0 1 Month Libor (2) 0.73% (4) $2,850.0 (1) Notional value amortizes from $400.0 million to $200.0 million on February 1, 2011.(2) 0.26% in effect at December 31, 2010.(3) 0.30% in effect at December 31, 2010.(4) Does not include the applicable margin and facility fees paid to bank lenders on Term Loan A and Revolving Loan as described above.We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2 type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps. Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans wi th foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our international operations generated approximately $833.7 million in reven ues, excluding the termination fee of $83.3 million paid by Banco Santander to exit the Brazilian Venture, during the year ended December 31, 2010, of which approximately $709.2 million were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies to which we are exposed are the Brazilian Real, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): Currency2010 2009Real$32.5 $28.2 Euro18.6 19.1 Pound Sterling9.0 6.4 Total impact$60.1 $53.7 The impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10% change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant. Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and 37Table of Contentsoptions, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes. During 2010, we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans. At December 31, 2010, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $56.5 million and the fair value was nominal. Th ese derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 38Table of Contents
