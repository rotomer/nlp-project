Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following section discusses managements view of the financial condition and results of operations of FIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes of FIS included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section.OverviewFIS is a leading global provider dedicated to banking and payments technologies. With a long history deeply rooted in the financial services sector, FIS serves more than 14,000 institutions in over 100 countries. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs approximately 33,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions, providing software, services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions. FIS tops the 2011 annual FinTech 100 list, is a member of the Fortune 500 U.S. and of Standard and Poors (S&P) 500 Index. We have four reporting segments: FSG, PSG, ISG and Corporate and Other. A description of these segments is included above in Item 1. Revenues by segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations.Business Trends and Conditions Our revenue is derived from a combination of recurring services, professional services and software license fees. Recurring services, which have historically represented more than 80% of our revenue, are provided under multi year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream. However, a significant portion of these recurring revenues are derived from transaction processing fees and fluctuate with the level of deposit and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity. Sales of software licenses and professional services are less predictable and can be regarded as discretionary spending by our customers. We continually seek opportunities to enhance revenues and to manage our costs and capital expenditures prudently in light of any shifting revenue trends in response to broader economic conditions. We acquired Capco in December 2010 to broaden our capabilities to provide strategic and business transformation consulting. While this will generate increased revenues, the lower profit margin realized for professional services as compared to our other solutions has resulted in profit margin compression. The addition of Capco has also reduced the relative proportion of our recurring revenue stream. As the payment market continues to evolve from paper based to electronic, we continue to add new services responsive to this trend. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point of sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card related services. In recent years, we have added a variety of stored value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as well as a number of card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common goal of these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution. The evolution to electronic transactions also intensifies the vulnerability to fraud, increasing the demand for our risk management solutions. At the same time, the use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and item processing businesses.We compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process in house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of year to year economic changes on our results of operations. One of the current trends from which we are benefiting in the financial services industry is the migration by our clients to an outsourced model to improve their profitability.While we are cautious regarding broader economic improvement, we expect banks to continue investing in new technology and believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the overall market continues to recover. We anticipate consolidation within the banking industry to continue, including additional bank failures and increased merger and acquisition activity. As a whole, consolidation activity is detrimental to our business. Consolidation at the transaction level may be beneficial or detrimental to our business. When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments 26Table of Contentssystems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market share if we are providing services to both entities, or we are not the merging parties provider of core or payment processing, or if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company. The Dodd Frank Act and associated Durbin Amendment were passed and signed into law in 2010. The Dodd Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the new federal Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and will require this and other federal agencies to implement many new regulations. The Durbin Amendment, released by the Federal Reserve in June 2011, mandates a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for card issuers with assets greater than $10.0 billion. This legislated interchange fee cap has the potential to alter the type and or volume of card based transactions that we process on behalf of our customers. We believe we are competitively positioned to offset or take advantage of any potential shifts in payment transaction volume as we offer multiple payment solutions and options to our clients. We also believe that compliance with the network exclusivity provisions of the Durbin Amendment, which require all debit card issuers to have at least two unaffiliated networks for purposes of processing signature debit and PIN debit transactions, could positively or negatively impact transaction volumes in our NYCE PIN debit network. These new regulations could result in the need for us to make capital investments to modify our products and services to facilitate our existing customers and potential customers compliance. Further, the requirements of the new regulations and the timing of their effective dates could result in changes in our customers business practices that may alter their delivery of services to consumers and the timing of their investment decisions, which could change the demand for our software and services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our customers.Notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions, our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions during the year ended December 31, 2011, including Europe. The majority of our European revenue is generated by clients in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Those countries encountering the most significant economic challenges, including Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, account for less than 1% of our international revenue base. Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing, credit and debit card processing services, other payment processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services and products. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. We are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination, we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Due to the large number, broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to, the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position. However, the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for 27Table of Contentsdoubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $33.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Reserves for Check Guarantee LossesIn our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writers bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the checks face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our estimates.Historically, such estimation processes have proved to be materially accurate; however, our projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our customers, and other factors could impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $68.0 million and $69.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. A ten percent difference in our estimated check guarantee loss reserve net of estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2011 would have impacted 2011 net earnings by less than $2.0 million, after tax.Computer SoftwareComputer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized software development costs. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, computer software, net of accumulated amortization, was $881.5 million and $909.0 million, respectively. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over its estimated useful life. The capitalization of software development costs is governed by FASB ASC Subtopic 985 20 if the software is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, or by FASB ASC Subtopic 350 40 if the software is for internal use. After the technological feasibility of the software has been established (for software to be marketed), or at the beginning of application development (for internal use software), software development costs, which include salaries and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility (for software to be marketed), or prior to application development (for internal use software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date of general release of the products (for software to be marketed) or the date placed in service (for internal use software). Software development costs for software to be marketed are amortized using the greater of (1) the straight line method over its estimated useful life, which ranges from three to ten years, or (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life.In determining useful lives, management considers historical results and technological trends which may influence the estimate. Useful lives for all computer software range from three to 10 years. Amortization expense for computer software was $209.4 million, $195.1 million and $149.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was amortization expense on computer software of $0.0 million, $3.3 million and $0.7 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also assess the recorded value of computer software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset. There are inherent uncertainties in determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. While we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to such changes in the future.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsWe are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the 28Table of Contentstransaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a significant amount of management judgment. We generally engage independent valuation specialists to assist us in making fair value determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any change in circumstances that may indicate the assets useful life is no longer indefinite.We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Prior to 2011, the authoritative guidance required us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach utilizes earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting units net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we would perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and any impairment charge. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 08 ("ASU 2011 08"), Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The revised standard allows an entity first to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the step one quantitative test ("step zero"). An entity is required to perform step one only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent). ASU 2011 08 provided examples of events and circumstances that should be considered in performing the step zero qualitative assessment, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events affecting a reporting unit or the entity as a whole and a sustained decrease in share price. There was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units in the 2010 step one analysis. In performing the 2011 step zero qualitative analysis, examining those factors most likely to affect our valuations, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to exceed their carrying amounts. Consequently, we did not perform a step one analysis in 2011. We also estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value annually. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.1 million related to the Capco trademark in North America. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the Brazilian Venture that was attributable to Banco Santander was deemed impaired due to the exit of Banco Santander. Accordingly, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $140.3 million in the third quarter of 2010. Additionally, in 2010 we recorded a $5.2 million impairment of intangible assets related to the discontinued operations of Participacoes, as discussed in Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets indicated an impairment of certain trademarks which were discontinued as a result of the Companys rebranding campaign initiated on October 1, 2009, following the acquisition of Metavante. Accordingly, we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of $124.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other assumptions.Accounting for Income TaxesAs part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues or in the estimated level of annual 29Table of Contentspre tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However, final determination of prior year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period that determination is made.Related Party TransactionsWe are a party to certain historical related party agreements with FNF and other related parties (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report).Factors Affecting ComparabilityOur Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions:In December 2010, we acquired Capco and have included the results of operations and financial position of Capco in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. In August 2010, we completed a leveraged recapitalization. Through a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, we repurchased 86.2 million shares of our common stock, including 6.4 million shares underlying previously unexercised stock options. The repurchased shares were added to treasury stock. The recapitalization was funded by incremental debt, as outlined under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing."On October 1, 2009, we acquired Metavante in a tax free reorganization. Each outstanding share of Metavante common stock was converted into 1.35 shares, or approximately 163.6 million total shares, of FIS common stock. Outstanding Metavante stock options and other stock based awards were converted into FIS stock options and stock based awards using the same exchange ratio. The results of operations and financial position of Metavante are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition.As a result of the above transactions, the results of operations and earnings per share in the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be directly comparable.30Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations(in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009Processing and services revenues$5,745.7 $5,269.5 $3,711.1Cost of revenues3,998.0 3,637.7 2,741.5Gross profit1,747.7 1,631.8 969.6Selling, general, and administrative expenses671.8 675.8 547.1Impairment charges9.1 154.9 136.9Operating income1,066.8 801.1 285.6Other income (expense): Interest income6.0 6.4 3.4Interest expense(264.8) (179.7) (134.0)Other income (expense), net(63.7) (11.5) 8.7Total other income (expense)(322.5) (184.8) (121.9)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes744.3 616.3 163.7Provision for income taxes239.0 215.3 54.7Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax505.3 401.0 109.0Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(24.2) (43.1) (0.5)Net earnings481.1 357.9 108.5Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(11.5) 46.6 (2.6)Net earnings attributable to FIS$469.6 $404.5 $105.9Net earnings per share basic from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.64 $1.30 $0.45Net earnings (loss) per share basic from discontinued operations attributable to FIS common stockholders(0.08) (0.12) Net earnings per share basic attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.56 $1.17 $0.45Weighted average shares outstanding basic300.6 345.1 236.4Net earnings per share diluted from continuing operations attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.61 $1.27 $0.44Net earnings (loss) per share diluted from discontinued operations attributable to FIS common stockholders(0.08) (0.12) Net earnings per share diluted attributable to FIS common stockholders$1.53 $1.15 $0.44Weighted average shares outstanding diluted307.0 352.0 239.4Amounts attributable to FIS common stockholders: Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax$493.8 $447.6 $106.4Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(24.2) (43.1) (0.5)Net earnings attributable to FIS$469.6 $404.5 $105.9Processing and Services RevenuesProcessing and services revenues totaled $5,745.7 million, $5,269.5 million and $3,711.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in revenue during 2011 of $476.2 million, or 9.0%, as compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to incremental revenues of $304.7 million from 2010 acquisitions, increased demand for professional services and increased processing revenues. Total revenue growth in these areas was tempered by lower item processing and retail check activity and the change in reporting certain merchant interchange fees from gross to net revenue recognition, as discussed in greater detail under Segment Results of Operations. The 2011 period also included $47.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar during the 2011 period. The 2010 period was also favorably impacted by the recognition of an $83.3 million termination fee in connection with Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture. The increase in revenue during 2010 of $1,558.4 million, or 42.0%, as compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the Metavante Acquisition and to a lesser extent the recognition of the $83.3 million termination fee mentioned above, revenue 31Table of Contentsfrom 2010 acquisitions of $23.4 million and a favorable foreign currency impact of $26.4 million resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar. Cost of Revenues and Gross ProfitCost of revenues totaled $3,998.0 million, $3,637.7 million and $2,741.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $1,747.7 million, $1,631.8 million and $969.6 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (gross margin) was 30.4%, 31.0% and 26.1% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues of $360.3 million in the 2011 period as compared to the 2010 period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above. The termination fee received in connection with Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture favorably augmented gross margins for the 2010 periods, contributing to a decrease in gross margin of 60 basis points during the 2011 period by comparison. Further, while Capco has provided revenue growth in 2011, the lower margin contribution has unfavorably impacted gross margin. The increase in cost of revenues of $896.2 million in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period is directly attributable to the revenue variances addressed above. The increase in gross margin of 490 basis points for 2010 over 2009 was driven by the cost synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante Acquisition as well as by the termination fee received in connection with Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled $671.8 million, $675.8 million and $547.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease of $4.0 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher expenses included in the 2010 period in connection with our leveraged recapitalization, partially offset by incremental operating costs in 2011 resulting from 2010 acquisitions, as well as the $22.3 million reduction in contingent consideration liability for Capco addressed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Conversely, the 2010 period expenses were reduced by a $10.1 million recovery in September 2010 of legal costs previously incurred as the result of a favorable court ruling. Additionally, the 2011 period included a $13.0 million loss related to unauthorized activities on the Sunrise prepaid card platform (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase of $128.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to incremental costs associated with the Metavante operations and our leveraged recapitalization, partially offset by the $10.1 million recovery in the 2010 third quarter of previously incurred legal costs mentioned above and by lower integration and merger related charges and stock based compensation. Impairment ChargesImpairment charges totaled $9.1 million, $154.9 million and $136.9 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 charges relate to a reduction in the carrying value of the Capco trademark in North America. The 2010 charges relate to impairments resulting from the exit of Banco Santander from the Brazilian Venture, including $140.3 million representing the portion of the unamortized contract intangible asset recorded at the initiation of the Brazilian Venture that was attributable to Banco Santander, and the net unamortized balance of $14.6 million for certain capitalized software development costs incurred exclusively for use in processing Banco Santander card activity. The 2009 charges relate primarily to the introduction of a new brand identity in conjunction with the Metavante merger, giving rise to the impairment of a number of previously acquired trademarks. The 2009 period also included charges related to impairment of certain capitalized software assets totaling approximately $12.9 million. Operating IncomeOperating income totaled $1,066.8 million, $801.1 million and $285.6 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (operating margin) was 18.6%, 15.2% and 7.7% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating income and margins for the 2011 period as compared to the 2010 period was driven by the revenue and cost variances addressed above. The increase in operating margin for 2010 as compared to the 2009 period was driven by synergies, cost containment initiatives, gross margin improvements and lower stock compensation charges, partially offset by higher integration and merger related charges incurred during the 2010 period. Total Other Income (Expense)Total other income (expense) totaled $(322.5) million, $(184.8) million and $(121.9) million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The primary component of total other income (expense) is interest expense. The increases of $85.1 million in interest expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 and of $45.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from higher overall debt levels as a result of our recapitalization in mid 2010 and higher interest rates on our debt. Apart from interest expense, 32Table of Contentsthe 2011 period includes $14.1 million of debt refinancing expenses, $24.7 million in write off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and $34.0 million of other than temporary impairment of available for sale securities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Metavante. The 2010 period includes $13.7 million of debt extinguishment expenses, the write off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and fees and other expenses relating to our leveraged recapitalization. The 2010 period also includes the forgiveness of $19.4 million of notes payable representing additional consideration which was to be paid to the banks in the Brazilian Venture upon migration of their card portfolios and an extinguishment gain of $5.7 million from the restructuring of the remaining Banco Bradesco notes in conjunction with other revisions to the Brazilian Venture agreements (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Provision for Income TaxesIncome tax expense from continuing operations totaled $239.0 million, $215.3 million and $54.7 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on continuing operations of 32.1%, 34.9% and 33.4% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The net decrease in the overall effective tax rate for the 2011 period is primarily related to a larger proportion of foreign source pre tax income versus domestic income during the 2011 period and state income tax planning. Additionally, the 2011 period included a one time benefit for the favorable resolution of tax contingencies in international jurisdictions, implementation of federal tax planning strategies and a non recurring benefit related to our United Kingdom operations. The increase in the 2010 period overall effective tax rate as compared to the 2009 period is primarily related to a larger proportion of domestic pre tax income versus foreign source income due primarily to the Metavante Acquisition, partially offset by the utilization of foreign tax credits. Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued OperationsDuring the 2011, 2010 and 2009 periods, certain operations are classified as discontinued. Reporting for discontinued operations classifies revenues and expenses as one line item, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the third quarter of 2010, we determined that we would pursue strategic alternatives for Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda. ("Participacoes"). In January 2010, we closed on the sale of ClearPar. In October 2008, we sold Certegy Australia, Ltd. The table below outlines the components of discontinued operations for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 periods, net of tax. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2011 2010 2009 Impairment charges Participacoes$ $(16.6) $Participacoes operations(24.1) (25.2) (5.1)Certegy Australia operations 5.7Other(0.1) (1.3) (1.1) Total discontinued operations$(24.2) $(43.1) $(0.5)Participacoes had revenues of $11.7 million, $61.5 million and $58.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Participacoes had operating expenses of $48.3 million, $125.0 million and $66.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Participacoes processing volume was transitioned to other vendors or back to its customers during the second quarter of 2011. The 2011 and 2010 periods include charges of $34.6 million and $26.7 million, respectively to increase our accrual for potential labor claims related to the shut down activities. We expect to have continued exposure to labor claims, which were not transferred with other assets and liabilities in the disposal. Any changes in the estimated liability related to these labor claims will also be recorded as discontinued operations.Net (Earnings) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestNet (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest totaled $(11.5) million, $46.6 million and $(2.6) million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010 year included after tax charges totaling $50.1 million relating to the minority partners proportionate share of the write off of capitalized software development costs and of the impairment to the unamortized contract intangible asset resulting from the exit of Banco Santander from the Brazilian Venture. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Earnings from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax, Attributable to FIS Common StockholdersEarnings from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled $493.8 million, $447.6 33Table of Contentsmillion and $106.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, or $1.61, $1.27 and $0.44 per diluted share, respectively, due to the factors described above.Segment Results of OperationsFinancial Solutions Group 2011 2010 2009 (In millions)Processing and services revenues$2,076.8 $1,890.8 $1,260.0Operating income$680.3 $673.4 $421.1Operating margin32.8% 35.6% 33.4%Revenues for FSG totaled $2,076.8 million, $1,890.8 million and $1,260.0 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The overall segment increases of $186.0 million, or 9.8%, for 2011 as compared to 2010 were driven by incremental Capco revenues, as well as increased processing revenues and growth in professional services. The overall segment increase of $630.8 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted primarily from incremental Metavante revenues and to a lesser extent increased demand for professional services and software licenses. Operating income for FSG totaled $680.3 million, $673.4 million and $421.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 32.8%, 35.6% and 33.4% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating income during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily resulted from increased processing revenues and growth in professional services, partially offset by $12.4 million in merger, integration and severance costs. The decrease in operating margin during 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to a higher proportion of professional services revenue during 2011, including Capco consulting services revenue, which has a lower margin than other revenue sources, particularly in relation to the higher license revenues in 2010. The increase in operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily resulted from incremental Metavante operating income and the increase in operating margin is due to continuing results from the synergy initiatives associated with the Metavante Acquisition. Payment Solutions Group 2011 2010 2009 (In millions)Processing and services revenues$2,492.2 $2,478.1 $1,741.9Operating income$853.5 $835.0 $475.6Operating margin34.2% 33.7% 27.3%Revenues for PSG totaled $2,492.2 million, $2,478.1 million and $1,741.9 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 period included growth in print and mail and card personalization and electronic payment services, offset by lower item processing and retail check activity. Additionally, consolidation of our merchant processing platforms resulted in the utilization of the net method to account for certain merchant interchange fees, causing a $34.4 million unfavorable revenue variance during the 2011 period. The overall segment increase of $736.2 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted primarily from incremental Metavante revenues. Additionally, growth in electronic payment solutions was offset by lower item processing and retail check activity. Operating income for PSG totaled $853.5 million, $835.0 million and $475.6 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 34.2%, 33.7% and 27.3% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 period included $13.6 million of integration and severance costs, which reduced operating margins by approximately 60 basis points for 2011. Integration costs for the 2010 periods were included in the Corporate and Other Segment. The increase in operating income and operating margin in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period primarily resulted from incremental Metavante operating income and realized cost savings.34Table of ContentsInternational Solutions Group 2011 2010 2009 (In millions)Processing and services revenues$1,177.6 $917.0 $724.3Operating income$187.6 $71.1 $121.9Operating margin15.9% 7.8% 16.8%Revenues for ISG totaled $1,177.6 million, $917.0 million and $724.3 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The overall segment increases of $260.6 million for 2011 as compared to 2010 resulted primarily from incremental revenues from Capcos European business and increased credit card volumes in Brazil, growth in the India ATM management business, growth in Australia core banking revenues and license revenues from strategic customer relationships in EMEA. The 2011 period also included $47.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar during the 2011 period. The overall segment increase of $192.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from growth driven by increased payment volumes in Brazil, growth in professional services, higher license revenue and incremental revenues from the Metavante Acquisition. The 2010 period also included an $83.3 million termination fee received as a result of Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture and a $26.4 million favorable foreign currency impact resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar during 2010. Operating income for ISG totaled $187.6 million, $71.1 million and $121.9 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating margin was 15.9%, 7.8% and 16.8% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010 period included pre tax impairment charges of $154.9 million attributable to Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture. Excluding the impact of Banco Santanders exit, operating income and margin would have been $142.7 million or 15.6% for the 2010 period. The increases in operating income in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily resulted from the revenue growth noted above. While Capco has provided revenue growth, the lower margin contribution from Capco has unfavorably impacted ISGs overall margin. The decrease in operating income and margin in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from the impairment charges of $154.9 million attributable to Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture previously addressed above under total Company Impairment Charges, partially offset by the $83.3 million termination fee received as a result of Banco Santanders exit from the Brazilian Venture. Corporate and OtherThe Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were $654.6 million, $778.4 million and $733.0 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The overall Corporate and Other decrease of $123.8 million for 2011 as compared to 2010 is primarily due to restructuring and integration costs included in the 2010 period associated with merger and acquisition activity and expenses in connection with the leveraged recapitalization, partially offset by the recovery in 2010 of legal costs previously incurred as the result of a favorable court ruling, as addressed above under total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The 2011 period included the $13.0 million loss related to unauthorized activities on the Sunrise prepaid card platform noted under Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Results of Operations section above, $9.5 million in merger, integration and service costs, and a $13.2 million net benefit from adjustments from the Capco acquisition. The latter was comprised of a reduction in the contingent consideration liability of $22.3 million, partially offset by a $9.1 million impairment of the North American trademark. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $45.4 million for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily due to the incremental costs associated with the Metavante operations and merger related charges, partially offset by the recovery of previously incurred legal costs as the result of a favorable court ruling, as addressed above under total Company Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash RequirementsOur cash requirements include operating expenses, income taxes, mandatory debt service payments, capital expenditures, stockholder dividends, working capital, timing differences in settlement related assets and liabilities, and may include discretionary debt service, share repurchases, and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings. In 2012, our cash requirements also include the payment for accrued but unpaid reset payments associated with an interest rate swap assumed in connection with the Metavante Acquisition (see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) as well as the $36.5 million current liability due to the Brazilian venture partner (see Note 6 35Table of Contentsin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Also, our continuing cash requirements will include payments for labor claims related to FIS former item processing and remittance operations in Brazil (see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $415.5 million and debt of $4,809.8 million, including the current portion. Of the $415.5 million cash and cash equivalents, approximately $246.3 million is held by our foreign entities. We expect that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt.We have historically paid a $0.05 per common share dividend on a quarterly basis. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to increase the amount to $0.20 per share per quarter beginning in 2012. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share was paid on December 30, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2011. A regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per common share is payable on March 30, 2012, to shareholders of record as of the close of business March 16, 2012.Cash Flows from OperationsCash flows from operations were $1,171.5 million, $1,071.3 million and $714.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. Cash flows from operations increased $100.2 million in 2011 and $357.2 million in 2010 primarily due to higher earnings from operations. Capital ExpendituresOur principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We invested approximately $300.3 million, $314.0 million and $212.5 million on capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect to invest approximately 5 6% of 2012 revenue in capital expenditures, including incremental capital expenditures for information security initiatives. See "Business Information Security."Financing On December 19, 2011, FIS amended, restated and supplemented our syndicated credit agreement, which was originally issued on January 18, 2007, amended on July 30, 2007, amended and restated on June 29, 2010, and supplemented July 16, 2010 (as amended and supplemented through December 19, 2011, the FIS Credit Agreement). The FIS Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2011, provides total committed capital of $4,338.6 million comprised of: (1) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate maximum principal amount of $1,000.0 million maturing on July 18, 2014 ( the Revolving Loan); and (2) an aggregate of $3,338.6 million of term notes consisting of $2,088.6 million maturing on July 18, 2014 (Term Loan A 2), and $1,250.0 million maturing on July 18, 2016 ("New Term Loan B"). As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan was $175.0 million, with $824.0 million of borrowing capacity remaining thereunder (net of $1.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Loan). On January 30, 2012, FIS entered into a joinder agreement under which FIS accepted $50.0 million of additional revolving loan commitments increasing the maximum principal amount of the Revolving Loan to $1,050.0 million.FIS may borrow, repay and re borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until the applicable maturity date. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A 2 of $60.1 million per quarter from March 31, 2012 through December 31, 2012, and $90.1 million per quarter from March 31, 2013 through March 31, 2014, with the remaining principal balance payable on July 18, 2014. As of December 31, 2011, FIS had made principal prepayments under the Term Loan A 2 of $4.4 million, reducing the payment obligation scheduled for March 31, 2012 by the same amount. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under the New Term Loan B of $3.1 million per quarter from March 31, 2012 through June 30, 2016, with the remaining principal balance payable on July 18, 2016. Voluntary prepayment of the Term Loans is generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. The Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but will be due and payable in full on its applicable maturity date. Commitment reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice. In addition to scheduled principal payments, the Term Loans are (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of certain events.36Table of ContentsThe FIS Credit Agreement contains provisions permitting us to obtain additional term and or revolving loans in the future, conditioned upon our ability to obtain additional commitments from lenders to fund those loans, in a principal amount of up to $750.0 million. The FIS Credit Agreement remains subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on incurring indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default under the FIS Credit Agreement, the administrative agent can accelerate the maturity of all amounts borrowed. Events of default include the failure to pay principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants.On July 16, 2010, FIS completed offerings of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes and together with the 2017 Notes, the Notes). FIS issued the Notes in two separate series under an indenture dated as of July 16, 2010 among FIS, FIS domestic subsidiaries that guaranteed its amended credit facility (the Guarantors) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Notes were offered and sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and outside the United States to non U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. We have since completed an exchange offer under which we exchanged identical notes that were SEC registered for the Notes. On December 19, 2011, FIS entered into a supplemental indenture whereby FIS issued an additional $150.0 million of our 7.625% Senior Notes due July 16, 2017 (the "Additional 2017 Notes") that have the same terms as the existing 2017 Notes. The Additional 2017 Notes were offered and sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States to non U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Additional 2017 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold without registration unless pursuant to an exemption from, or in, a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all applicable state laws. References to the Notes and 2017 Notes hereinafter include the Additional 2017 Notes. Interest on the 2017 Notes accrues at the rate of 7.625% per annum and interest on the 2020 Notes accrues at the rate of 7.875% per annum. Interest on each series of Notes is payable semi annually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Guarantors. The following table summarizes the mandatory annual principal payments pursuant to the FIS Credit Agreement and the Notes as of December 31, 2011 (in millions). There are no mandatory principal payments on the Revolving Loan and any balance outstanding on the Revolving Loan will be due and payable at its scheduled maturity date: Term Loan A 2 Term Loan B 2017 Notes 2020 Notes Total2012$235.9 $12.5 $ $ $248.42013360.5 12.5 373.020141,492.2 12.5 1,504.72015 12.5 12.52016 1,200.0 1,200.0Thereafter 750.0 500.0 1,250.0Total$2,088.6 $1,250.0 $750.0 $500.0 $4,588.6We monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions, both domestic and international. The combined commitments of our top 10 revolving lenders comprise about 72% of our Revolving Loan. The failure of any single lender to perform their obligations under the Revolving Loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations. If the single largest lender were to default under the terms of the FIS Credit Agreement (impacting the capacity of the Revolving Loan), the maximum loss of available capacity on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Loan, as of December 31, 2011, would be approximately $105.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term Loans from variable to fixed (see Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks).During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company entered into capital lease obligations of $31.4 million for certain 37Table of Contentscomputer hardware and software. The assets are included in property and equipment and computer software and any remaining capital lease obligation is classified as long term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. Private Placement InvestmentOn October 1, 2009, pursuant to an investment agreement with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL) and FNF dated as of March 31, 2009, FIS issued and sold (a) to THL in a private placement 12.9 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200.0 million and (b) to FNF in a private placement 3.2 million shares of FIS common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.0 million. FIS paid each of THL and FNF a transaction fee equal to 3% of their respective investments. Contractual ObligationsFIS long term contractual obligations generally include its long term debt, interest on long term debt, lease payments on certain of its property and equipment and payments for data processing and maintenance. The following table summarizes FIS significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter TotalLong term debt$259.2 $408.4 $1,679.7 $12.5 $1,200.0 $1,250.0 $4,809.8Interest(1)224.9 211.4 180.9 151.6 130.5 209.7 1,109.0Operating leases69.9 55.6 42.3 31.3 22.5 63.7 285.3Data processing and maintenance116.8 95.3 34.6 17.7 17.8 17.6 299.8Other contractual obligations (2)84.7 18.7 14.1 8.6 8.7 30.9 165.7Total$755.5 $789.4 $1,951.6 $221.7 $1,379.5 $1,571.9 $6,669.6(1)These calculations assume that: (a) applicable margins remain constant; (b) all variable rate debt is priced at the three month LIBOR rate in effect as of December 31, 2011; (c) no new hedging transactions are effected; (d) only mandatory debt repayments are made; and (e) no refinancing occurs at debt maturity. (2)Amount includes the payment for accrued but unpaid reset payments associated with an interest rate swap assumed in connection with the Metavante acquisition (see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), amounts due to the Brazilian venture partner and payments for labor claims related to FIS former item processing and remittance operations in Brazil (see Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS expected short term liquidity needs and its long term needs for the operations of its business, expected capital spending for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsFIS does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity. Interest Rate RiskIn addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps. 38Table of ContentsThe Notes represent substantially all of our fixed rate long term debt obligations. The carrying value of the Notes was $1,250.0 million as of December 31, 2011. The fair value of the Notes was approximately $1,362.5 million as of December 31, 2011. The potential reduction in fair value of the Notes from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase the Notes before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition.Our floating rate long term debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the FIS Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2011, we are paying interest on our Term Loan A 2 of LIBOR plus 2.25%, and on our Term Loan B at LIBOR plus 3.25% (with LIBOR subject to a 1.00% floor). Interest on the Revolving Loan is generally payable at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 2.50% and is subject to an unused commitment fee of up to 0.50%, each based upon the Companys leverage ratio. An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service under the FIS Credit Agreement, after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $12.9 million (based on principal amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2011). We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of December 31, 2011, less the principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt. This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of December 31, 2011, and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts on the Revolving Loan and Term Loans A 1 and A 2 and Old Term Loan B outstanding as of December 31, 2010, and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by $3.4 million. We use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps decreased by $1,100.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loan from variable to fixed (in millions):Effective date Termination date Notional amount Bank pays variable rate of FIS pays fixed rate of February 1, 2008 February 1, 2012 200.0 Three Month LIBOR (1) 3.87%(3)February 1, 2008 February 1, 2012 200.0 Three Month LIBOR (1) 3.44%(3)November 1, 2010 November 1, 2012 150.0 One Month LIBOR (2) 0.50%(3)February 1, 2011 February 1, 2013 200.0 One Month LIBOR (2) 0.62%(3)May 3, 2011 May 1, 2013 400.0 One Month LIBOR (2) 0.73%(3)September 1, 2011 September 1, 2014 150.0 One Month LIBOR (2) 0.74%(3)September 1, 2011 September 1, 2014 150.0 One Month LIBOR (2) 0.74%(3)September 1, 2011 September 1, 2014 300.0 One Month LIBOR (2) 0.72%(3) $1,750.0 (1)0.58% in effect as of December 31, 2011.(2)0.30% in effect as of December 31, 2011.(3)Does not include the applicable margin and facility fees paid to bank lenders on Term Loan A 2 and Revolving Loan as described above. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2 type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps.Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign 39Table of Contentssubsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our international operations generated approximately $1,177.6 million in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 of which approximately $1,005.8 million was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies to which we are exposed are the Brazilian Real, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have resulted in the following increase or decrease in our reported revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions):Currency 2011 2010 2009Real $42.4 $32.5 $28.2Euro 26.4 18.6 19.1Pound Sterling 17.6 9.0 6.4Total impact $86.4 $60.1 $53.7The impact on earnings of the foregoing assumed 10% change in each of the periods presented would not have been significant. Revenue included $47.4 million and operating income included $8.2 million of favorable foreign currency impact during the year ended December 31, 2011 resulting from a weaker U.S. Dollar during the 2011 period compared to 2010. Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes. We entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans. As of December 31, 2011, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $59.4 million and the fair value was nominal. These derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 40Table of Contents
