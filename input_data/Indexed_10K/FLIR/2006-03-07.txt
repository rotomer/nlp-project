ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview FLIR was founded in 1978, originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits of neighborhoods by helping to determine whether there was any abnormal leakage of heat coming from the doors, windows, walls and roofs of each house. As demand for that application declined, we began to focus on other applications and markets for our technology, in particular, designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement. Since then, we have continued to develop thermal imaging products for a growing number of applications and have now become one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial, industrial and government markets, internationally as well as domestically. Our business is now organized around two principal business segments, Thermography and Imaging. Our Thermography market primarily consists of the use of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences, which is useful for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications. Uses for our Thermography products include predictive and preventative maintenance, process control, condition monitoring, moisture detection, commercial and residential building inspection and scientific analysis. Our Thermography products are produced at our facilities in Stockholm, Boston and Santa Barbara. A growing distribution network has enabled us to penetrate existing and emerging markets and applications worldwide. Our Imaging business offers a wide array of products, all of which allow the user to see in total darkness, and through many types of obscurants, such as smoke, haze and most types of fog. Product offerings include hand held and fixed mounted products for ground, airborne and maritime applications. Applications for our Imaging products include force protection, counter terrorism, search and rescue, perimeter security, navigation safety, law enforcement, narcotics detection, maritime and border patrol, electronic news gathering, anti piracy and firefighting. Our Imaging products are primarily produced at our Portland, Boston, Santa Barbara and Stockholm facilities. A substantial portion of our revenue in the Imaging business is derived from sales to government agencies and we are continuing to expand our military program business, both in the United States and internationally. Our 2004 acquisition of Indigo Systems Corporation (Indigo), a leading producer of infrared detectors, infrared cameras, and camera subsystems which is located in Santa Barbara, California, provides us with the ability to design and produce infrared detectors for both our Imaging and Thermography business. Indigo has also allowed us to expand our presence in certain markets, including high end scientific cameras, OEMs and certain military program markets. International revenue accounted for approximately 44%, 42% and 43% of our revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue. We have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies. Factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in Stockholm, significant sales denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the US dollar, Euro and Swedish Kroner. During 2005, there were significant fluctuations in the values of the major currencies in which we conduct business, in particular, a strengthening of the US dollar against the Swedish Kroner. The impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements, but in aggregate, did not have a material impact on our results of operations. We typically experience longer payment cycles on our international sales, which can have an adverse impact upon our liquidity. In addition, substantial portions of our operations are conducted outside the United States, 26 Table of Contents including manufacturing in Stockholm and sales operations worldwide. International sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls, export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, political and economic instability, trade restrictions, labor union activities, changes in tariffs and taxes, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, and general economic conditions. We experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles, such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the US and certain foreign governments, the frequent requirement by certain customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of December due to funding considerations, and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. Such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future. As a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, goodwill impairment, warranty obligations, contingencies and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. The majority of our revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations, pursuant to guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104), issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2003. We typically design, market and sell our products as commercial, off the shelf products. Many of our Imaging customers, particularly those who use our airborne systems, request different system configurations, based on standard options or accessories that we offer. In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria. In those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate the system meets those specifications prior to shipment. For any contracts with multiple elements (i.e., training, installation, additional parts) undelivered at the end of a reporting period, we recognize revenue on the delivered elements only after we have determined that the delivered elements have stand alone value and any undelivered elements have objective and reliable evidence of fair value. The recognition of revenue on contracts with multiple elements is consistent with guidance provided by EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal. We also have a limited number of design and development contracts, principally with governmental customers, that are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of 27 Table of Contents Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1). Under SOP 81 1, revenues and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method. Allowance for doubtful accounts. Our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits. We regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customers account balance becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. Actual write offs during the past three years have been insignificant. We also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2005, our accounts receivable balance of $142.8 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1.3 million. We believe our reported allowances at December 31, 2005, are adequate. If the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate, however, resulting in their inability to make payments, we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made. Inventory write downs. As a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems, we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures in products and prices, and the availability of key components from our suppliers. Our policy is to establish inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. When recorded, our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis. As of December 31, 2005, our inventories of $103.8 million are stated net of inventory write downs of $12.5 million. If actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project, additional inventory write downs may be required. Cost basis investments. We have invested in three third party entities. The investments are accounted for on a cost basis since we do not have controlling interests in these entities nor do we have the ability to exercise significant influence on them. As of December 31, 2005, we have carrying values of these investments of approximately $2.4 million. We periodically review the investments for impairment to determine if events or changes in the business conditions of those entities indicate the carrying value of our investments may not be recoverable. These reviews may be based upon factors that include, but are not limited to, hypothetical liquidations of the investees at book value and current or recent financings received by the investees. If future changes in business results or market conditions indicate that any impairment, other than temporary, exists on these investments, we may need to record reserves against those investments. Goodwill impairment. We have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions. We review goodwill in June of each year, or on an interim basis if required, for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such 28 Table of Contents reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundary of the overall market capitalization of the Company. Our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets, which have a carrying value of $158.1 million as of December 31, 2005. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future which could result in an impairment of goodwill. Product warranties. Our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time, generally twelve months, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized. We believe that our recorded liability of $5.1 million at December 31, 2005, is adequate to cover our future cost of materials, labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date. If actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly. Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. Income taxes. We record our deferred tax assets at an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future. In making that determination, we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon, but not limited to, general economic conditions, competitive pressures, and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2005, we have determined that no valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $27.1 million is required. If we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made. Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 45.6 48.4 46.9 Gross profit 54.4 51.6 53.1 Operating expenses: Research and development 10.1 9.5 9.8 Selling, general and administrative 19.5 19.5 20.9 Total operating expenses 29.6 29.0 30.7 Earnings from operations 24.8 22.6 22.4 Interest expense 1.6 1.7 1.6 Interest income (0.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.8 ) Other (income) expense, net (0.3 ) 0.3 1.2 Earnings before income taxes 24.0 20.7 20.4 Income tax provision 6.2 5.9 6.1 Net earnings 17.8 % 14.8 % 14.3 % 29 Table of Contents Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 Revenue. Revenue for 2005 totaled $508.6 million, an increase of 5.4% over the $482.7 million in revenue in 2004. Revenue from the Imaging business segment increased 1.7% from $319.5 million in 2004 to $325.0 million in 2005. Revenue from the Thermography business segment increased 12.5% from $163.1 million in 2004 to $183.6 million in 2005. The slight increase in Imaging revenue was primarily due to increases in the sales of airborne products, offset by a decrease in the sales of land products. The increase in Thermography revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes, particularly of E Series and OEM products due to new markets and applications being identified and addressed. Revenue for 2004 totaled $482.7 million, an increase of 54.7% over the $312.0 million in revenue in 2003. Revenue from the Imaging business segment increased 65.4% from $193.1 million in 2003 to $319.5 million in 2004. Revenue from the Thermography business segment increased 37.3% from $118.8 million in 2003 to $163.1 million in 2004. The increase in Imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes arising from strong demand in virtually all markets, and to the revenue provided through our acquisition of Indigo in January. The increase in Thermography revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes, particularly of E Series, P Series and A Series products, due to new and emerging markets and the increased penetration by our expanding distribution network. International revenue in 2005 totaled $221.7 million, representing 43.6% of revenue. This compares to international revenue in 2004 which totaled $201.5 million, representing 41.8% of revenue, and $134.9 million, or 43.2% of revenue in 2003. While the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly from year to year, we anticipate the mix to be approximately 55% to 60% domestic and 40% to 45% international on a long term basis. Gross profit. Gross profit in 2005 was 54.4% of revenue, compared to 51.6% in 2004. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the product mix within both our Imaging and Thermography segments, our ability to lower component costs, including successfully integrating Indigo sensors into our products, production efficiencies at our Imaging facilities, the product mix between the Thermography and Imaging segments and $1.3 million of expense in 2004 related to the recognition of the one time stepped up values of the acquired inventories of Indigo. We historically experience higher gross margins in our Thermography business than in our Imaging business. Thermography represented 36.1% of total revenue in 2005 compared to 33.8% in 2004. Gross profit in 2004 was 51.6% of revenue, compared to 53.1% in 2003. The gross profit for 2004 included $2.8 million of amortization expense attributable to developed technology intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition of Indigo and $1.3 million of expense related to the recognition of the one time stepped up values of the acquired inventories of Indigo. The remaining decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits for our Indigo products and a change in the mix of revenue between the Imaging and Thermography businesses, as Thermography revenue represented 33.8% of total revenue in 2004 compared to 38.1% in 2003. Offsetting a portion of these factors were manufacturing improvements and efficiencies implemented within the Imaging operations. Research and development. Research and development expenses were $51.5 million, or 10.1% of revenue, in 2005 compared to $45.8 million, or 9.5% of revenue, in 2004. The increase in spending in 2005 was due to the continued investment in new products and engineering to enable future growth. We believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business. We expect research and development expenses to represent 8% to 10% of our revenue on a long term basis. Research and development expenses were $45.8 million, or 9.5% of revenue, in 2004 compared to $30.7 million, or 9.8% of revenue, in 2003. The significant increase in spending in 2004 was due to the research and development expenses of Indigo and the continued growth in spending related to our existing Imaging and Thermography businesses. 30 Table of Contents We have also incurred expenses associated with customer funded design and development contracts. Such expenses were $10.6 million in 2005, $12.4 million in 2004 and $4.0 million in 2003. These expenses are reported as cost of goods sold since the related funding is reported as revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.2 million, or 19.5% of revenue in 2005 compared to $94.2 million, or 19.5% of revenue in 2004. Included in selling, general and administrative expense are charges related to legal and professional fees associated with our indemnification and cost advancement payments on behalf of former officers who are the subject of criminal and civil enforcement actions. Such indemnification and cost advancement expenses totaled $4.6 million and $2.1 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. We anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94.2 million, or 19.5% of revenue in 2004 compared to $65.0 million, or 20.9% of revenue in 2003. The significant increase in spending in 2004 is due to the Indigo acquisition, including amortization expense of $2.7 million for certain customer and trademark intangible assets acquired, and due to the growth in the Companys business during the year. The decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue was a result of the revenue increase during the year and the ability to manage spending growth at a lower level than the revenue growth. Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $7.9 million, $8.1 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in interest from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the interest on the convertible notes that were issued in June 2003. Interest income. Interest income was $2.6 million, $0.5 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in interest income in 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in invested cash as a result of the Indigo acquisition at the beginning of 2004. Other income/expense. We reported other income of $1.5 million for 2005, and other expenses of $1.6 million and $3.6 million for 2004 and 2003. The other income/expense is primarily currency gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our European operations. Other income in 2005 was primarily due to the US dollar strengthening against European currencies during the year while other expense in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to the European currencies strengthening against the US dollar during those years. Income taxes. Our income tax provision was $31.5 million, $28.4 million and $19.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 25.7%, 28.4% and 30.0%, respectively. The mix in taxable income between our US and foreign operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years. Our effective tax rate is lower than the US Federal tax rate of 35 percent because of lower foreign tax rates, the effect of our current foreign tax structure which we established in the third quarter of 2004 and estimated tax credits. During the fourth quarter of calendar year 2005, we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Based upon this evaluation, we made the decision to repatriate $37.5 million under the Jobs Act. This repatriation caused the recognition of $1.0 million, net of foreign tax credits, of tax expense. This tax expense is reflected in current income tax expense for 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had US tax net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) totaling approximately $23.9 million and state tax NOLs totaling approximately $64.4 million which expire in the years 2019 through 2024. Additionally, we have various federal tax credits available aggregating $14.5 million and various state tax credits available aggregating $2.5 million (net of federal benefit), which expire in the years 2007 through 2025. We have generated deductions for US tax purposes related to the exercise of stock options that have served to offset the reductions in our NOLs. The utilization of these stock option exercise deductions is accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in our income tax provision. 31 Table of Contents Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets to the extent that we assess the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not; otherwise, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. Based on this guidance, we believe that the net deferred tax assets of $27.1 million reflected on the December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet, is realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and we have not recorded a valuation allowance. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions, including but not limited to continued growth of the Thermography and Imaging markets, competitive pressures on sales and gross margins, successful implementation of tax planning strategies, and other factors beyond our control. Absolute assurance can not be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if our future forecasts of taxable income are not achieved. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, we had $107.1 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $120.7 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily from $48.5 million used to repurchase approximately 2 million shares of our common stock, capital expenditures of $34.0 million, including the purchase of a building and associated property in Wilsonville, Oregon for $10.2 million, and the acquisition of Brysen Optical Corporation for $4.2 million and Scientific Materials Corporation for $13.5 million, partially offset by the cash provided from operations of $73.1 million and proceeds of $27.3 million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan. Cash provided by operating activities in 2005 totaled $73.1 million compared to $75.1 million in 2004. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivables and the decrease in the income tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. At December 31, 2005, we had accounts receivable in the amount of $142.8 million compared to $116.9 million at December 31, 2004. The increase of $25.9 million in the receivable balance was primarily due to the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had inventories of $103.8 million compared to $98.3 million at December 31, 2004. The 5.7 % increase in inventories was consistent with the revenue growth during 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had prepaid expenses and other current assets of $33.2 million compared to $21.8 million at December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to overpayments of tax deposits in Europe in 2005 and increases in advances to vendors. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $52.9 million, primarily arising from the purchase of the Wilsonville, Oregon property, and other capital expenditures, and the acquisition of Brysen Optical Corporation and Scientific Materials Corporation. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $175.2 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Indigo for $160.0 million, net of cash acquired. Accounts payable increased from $32.3 million at December 31, 2004 to $34.5 million at December 31, 2005. The increase relates to the increase in inventories. Accrued payroll and related liabilities decreased from $22.4 million at December 31, 2004 to $20.4 million at December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of payroll payments and lower bonus accruals. On April 28, 2004, we signed an amended and restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A., and U.S. Bank National Association. The agreement provides 32 Table of Contents for a $50 million, five year revolving line of credit, with an option for an additional $50 million until April 28, 2008. Under the Credit Agreement, borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the Bank of America or Eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread under/over such rates based upon our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2005, the interest rate ranged from 5.70% to 6.75%. The Credit Agreement contains four financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, in addition to minimum levels of EBITDA and consolidated net worth and a maximum level of capital expenditures, and is collateralized by substantially all our assets. At December 31, 2005, we had no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and were in compliance with these four financial covenants. We had $3.4 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2005, which reduces the total available credit. Through two of our subsidiaries, we have a 30 million Swedish Kroner (approximately $3.8 million) line of credit at 2.20% and a $2 million line of credit at 6.00% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had no amounts outstanding on these lines. The 30 million Swedish Kroner line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of our Sweden subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis. The $2 million line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of our United Kingdom subsidiary and is subject to renegotiation annually. In June 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0% senior convertible notes due 2023 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The issuance was made through an initial offering of $175 million on June 11, 2003, and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional $35 million on June 17, 2003. The net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $203.9 million. Issuance costs are being amortized over a period of seven years. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 45.0612 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes prior to the maturity date in certain circumstances. We may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after June 8, 2010. The proceeds were used primarily for general corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of Indigo and other working capital and capital expenditure needs. During the quarter ended September 30, 2004, one of the terms that allow for conversion of our convertible notes, as described in the prospectus, was met. As of December 31, 2005, no note holders have elected to convert their notes into our stock. We do not anticipate any conversions before 2010. We believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities, and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2005, we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements. We also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements. Except for these operating lease agreements, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 33 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2005, our contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5Years More than 5 Years Long term debt $ 210,081 $ 56 $ 14 $ 11 $ 210,000 Interest on long term debt 109,725 6,300 12,600 12,600 78,225 Operating leases 33,515 6,532 12,004 10,174 4,805 Licensing rights 5,650 250 725 1,100 3,575 Post retirement obligations 9,851 325 1,369 1,979 6,178 $ 368,822 $ 13,463 $ 26,712 $ 25,864 $ 302,783 Interest obligations on our long term debt are based upon the assumption that all convertible notes are held to maturity. Post retirement obligations are based upon actuarial assumptions. Actual payments may differ in terms of both timing and amounts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. The credit agreements are at variable rates. A change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. At December 31, 2005, no amounts were outstanding on any of our credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. Our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0%. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. The fair value of the notes at December 31, 2005, was approximately $246.8 million compared to a carrying value of $206.2 million. We have assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the United States that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies. Assets and liabilities located outside the United States are primarily located in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are considered long term. We do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. Because we market, sell and license our products throughout the world, we could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products. Our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into US dollars using the period end exchange rates at December 31, 2005, was approximately $131.8 million. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $13.2 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries. The Company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings. 34 Table of Contents
