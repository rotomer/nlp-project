ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview FLIR was founded in 1978, originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits of neighborhoods by helping to determine whether there was any abnormal leakage of heat coming from the doors, windows, walls and roofs of each house. As demand for that application declined, we began to focus on other applications and markets for our technology, in particular, designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement. Since then, we have continued to develop thermal imaging products for a growing number of applications and have now become one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial, industrial and government markets, internationally as well as domestically. During 2006, we separated the Imaging business segment into the Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems segments. Our business is now organized around three principal business segments, Thermography, Commercial Vision Systems and Government Systems. Accordingly, we have restated previously reported periods in a comparable basis. Our Thermography business primarily consists of the use of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences, which is useful for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications. Uses for our Thermography products include high end predictive and preventative maintenance, research and development, test and measurement, leak detection and scientific analysis. Our Thermography products are primarily produced at our facilities in Stockholm. A growing distribution network has enabled us to penetrate existing and emerging markets and applications worldwide. Our Commercial Vision Systems business is focused on the development, manufacture and sale of generally lower cost uncooled products to emerging commercial markets where the primary requirement is to see at night or in adverse conditions. These markets are developing rapidly, and include such uses as automotive night vision, recreational marine, firefighting, airborne law enforcement and commercial security. CVS also sell camera cores, readout integrated circuits and other sub components to Original Equipment Manufacturers in certain markets. Our infrared sensor business, which supplies both internal and external customers, is also a part of CVS. Vertical integration into infrared sensors, which was accomplished through our 2004 acquisition of Indigo Systems Corporation (Indigo), provides us with the ability to design and produce infrared detectors, which in turn allowed us to reduce our costs and open new markets. Our Government Systems business offers a wide array of products, all of which allow the user to see in total darkness, and through many types of obscurants, such as smoke, haze and most types of fog. The primary market for these products are government customers, who use our hand held and fixed mounted products for such applications as force protection, counter terrorism, search and rescue, perimeter security, navigation safety, law enforcement, narcotics detection, maritime and border patrol, and anti piracy. Our Government Systems products are primarily produced at our Portland, Boston and Stockholm facilities. A substantial portion of our revenue in the Government Systems business is derived from sales to government agencies and we are continuing to expand our military program business, both in the United States and internationally. International revenue accounted for approximately 45%, 44% and 42% of our revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue. We have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies. Factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in Stockholm, significant sales denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the US dollar, Euro and Swedish Kroner. During 2006, there were significant fluctuations in the values of the major currencies in which 31 Table of Contents we conduct business, in particular, a weakening of the US dollar against the Swedish Kroner. The impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements, but in aggregate, did not have a material impact on our results of operations. We typically experience longer payment cycles on our international sales, which can have an adverse impact upon our liquidity. In addition, substantial portions of our operations are conducted outside the United States, including manufacturing in Stockholm and sales operations worldwide. International sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls, export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, political and economic instability, trade restrictions, labor union activities, changes in tariffs and taxes, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, and general economic conditions. We experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles, such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the US and certain foreign governments, the frequent requirement by certain customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of December due to funding considerations, and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. Such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future. As a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Option Practices During 2006, we undertook a voluntary review of our historical stock option practices and related accounting treatment as a result of the apparent issuance of options on favorable dates prior to 2000. Based upon the preliminary results of this review, our Board of Directors (the Board) formed a Special Committee, comprised of two outside directors, to investigate stock option grants, practices and procedures from 1995 to 2006. The Special Committee conducted its investigation with the assistance of independent legal counsel from Perkins Coie, LLP and outside forensic accountants from Deloitte Financial Advisory Services, LLP which was retained by independent counsel. In the course of its investigation, the Special Committee and its legal and accounting advisors reviewed approximately 135,000 paper and electronic documents, conducted interviews with relevant management personnel and current and former members of the Compensation Committee, and evaluated the accounting for and documentation surrounding 26.3 million options, representing approximately 91% of options issued during the period from 1995 through 2006. The Special Committee has completed its investigation and has provided its findings and recommendations to the full Board. With respect to stock options granted during the period from early 1995 through the middle of 2000, the Special Committee found inaccuracies in the determination of measurement dates for certain stock option grants affecting our accounting and disclosures in those years. The Special Committee also found strong circumstantial evidence of the improper selection of grant dates given the lack of supporting documentation and the fact that the exercise price for certain grants were at the lowest stock price for the first quarter in each of the years from 1995 to 1999. With respect to stock options granted during the period from the middle of 2000 through 2006, the Special Committee identified certain procedural and corporate governance issues that resulted in the use of incorrect measurement dates, but did not find any evidence that grant dates were selected based upon an attempt to seek a favorable price. The Special Committee also reported that it investigated certain other option practices for the period from 1995 to 2006 and identified no evidence of improper dating of option exercises and limited exceptions related to accelerated vesting and leaves of absences. In addition to the Special Committees investigation on stock option practices, we reviewed restricted stock grants from 1996 through 2006. Our review of restricted stock grants from 1996 through 1999 also found strong 32 Table of Contents circumstantial evidence of the improper selection of measurement dates used to recognize compensation expense during those years. Based on the findings of the Special Committees investigation and our subsequent internal analysis, including our findings on restricted stock, we have concluded, and the Audit Committee of our Board has agreed, that a restatement of certain of our annual historical consolidated financial statements is appropriate. Therefore, we are recording additional non cash compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock based compensation programs, and we are restating previously filed financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The aggregate non cash compensation expense that is being recognized from 1995 through 2004 is $14.3 million, before related tax effects. The adjustments to record the non cash compensation expense also resulted in the recognition of additional payroll tax obligations of $1.8 million during that period, resulting in a cumulative reduction in earnings before taxes of $16.1 million through 2004. Since a portion of the compensation expense for financial statement purposes is not yet recognizable as a deduction for tax purposes, the aggregate benefit to our income tax provision during this period that is being recognized through the recording of deferred tax assets is $3.9 million, thereby resulting in a cumulative net income effect of $12.2 million for all adjustments being made from 1995 through 2004. The net income effect recorded was $0.9 million in 2004 and $11.4 million, cumulatively, prior to 2004. According to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related authoritative accounting literature in place prior to 2006, the measurement date for accounting purposes is the first date on which both the number of shares that an individual is entitled to receive and the option or purchase price, if any, are known. For each option or share granted, APB 25 requires the recognition of compensation expense equal to the market price of the stock at the measurement date minus the amount, if any, that an individual is required to pay for the option or share. The measurement date does not change the effective date of a grant but does determine the compensation expense, if any, required to be recognized for accounting purposes in connection with the grant. As a result of our review of stock option and restricted stock grants between 1995 and 2006, we have, in certain cases, established new measurement dates based upon the date we believe that the APB 25 criteria were satisfied. In cases where we established a new measurement date, we considered information that included, but was not limited to: dates that option grants were communicated to individuals; dates that option grant details were provided to third party service providers or used internally to enter the grants into the stock option system; contemporaneous emails; minutes of meetings of the Board and the Compensation Committee; information obtained in interviews with current and former Compensation Committee members and our management and employees; payroll records; personnel files; and various records maintained by our Legal, Finance and Human Resources Departments. For grants for which there was not sufficient evidence and documentation to support the original measurement date or determine the precise date when the number of options and exercise price were finalized, we used all available relevant information to form a reasonable conclusion as to the most likely measurement date for such grants. The following summarizes the results of the investigation of the Special Committee and our review and the impact of the primary stock option and restricted stock accounting errors, in terms of the non cash compensation expense before related tax effects, underlying this restatement. All references to the number of options or restricted shares and share prices in this discussion have been adjusted for all stock splits since 1995. Inaccurate measurement dates for certain stock options and restricted shares granted between January 5, 1995 and June 30, 2000. During the period from January 5, 1995 through June 30, 2000 we issued a total of 10.6 million stock options, with 7.0 million issued as part of annual bonus programs, 1.3 million issued in connection with acquisitions, 0.5 million issued to non employee directors and 1.8 million issued for other purposes, primarily in connection with hiring and promoting employees. We have determined that inaccurate measurement dates were used in connection with all six of the annual stock option bonus grants during this period. We also had a restricted stock program for officers from 1996 through 1999 and have determined that inaccurate measurement dates were used to originally recognize compensation expenses for all awards made under the restricted stock 33 Table of Contents programs which totaled 0.6 million shares. The amount of additional compensation expense being recorded during this period for both stock option grants and restricted stock awards is $3.6 million. The discussion following each of the italicized headings below provides further details of the types of errors identified and accounts for the entire $3.6 million of additional compensation expense arising from awards between 1995 and the middle of 2000. Our determination of the appropriate measurement date to be used for stock option grants between January 5, 1995 and June 30, 2000 was based upon the best available information or corroborative evidence for each respective grant as described below. Although our determined measurement date may be subsequent to the actual measurement date for some of these grants, based upon a sensitivity analysis of the potential price variance between the original grant date and our determined measurement date, the impact of any alternative revised measurement dates would not exceed $1.3 million of incremental compensation expense to the $14.3 million recognized in this restatement. Errors arising from likely grant dates selected in hindsight and incomplete lists of awards on option grant dates $2.6 million. The Special Committee identified strong circumstantial evidence that option grant dates used for annual awards from 1995 through 1999, totaling 5.4 million options, were selected based upon stock price considerations, likely using hindsight. Additionally, there was inadequate documentation to validate that complete lists of recipients of awards were available on the grant dates used. Option awards on January 6, 1995, January 19, 1996, January 2, 1997, February 3, 1998 and March 5, 1999 were dated prior to the dates on which complete lists of stock option recipients appear to have been available. The option grants in each of those years were dated as of the dates that had the lowest stock price in the first quarter of each respective year. These options were awarded in conjunction with an annual performance review program that occurred during the first quarter of each year. We have determined that the appropriate measurement date for these grants to be the date on which complete lists of stock option recipients or other corroborative evidence, including third party billing statements and option agreements, were available. The aggregate additional compensation expense related to these errors is $2.6 million. Errors relating to valuing compensation expense related to restricted stock awards with some measurement dates likely selected in hindsight $0.7 million. Beginning in 1996, we had a restricted stock program for officers. Under this program, officers were eligible to receive a maximum number of shares based upon attainment of defined annual financial performance criteria with the size of each award based upon the level of attainment of the performance criteria. Between 1996 and 1999, a total of 0.6 million shares were awarded to officers. Compensation expense was recognized in each respective year based upon the market price on the originally determined measurement date, with the measurement dates used in 1998 (October 7) at the lowest price in the fourth quarter and second lowest price in the year, and in 1999 (October 21) on the lowest price of the year. Actual results against the performance criteria could not be determined until after the end of each respective year and after the Compensation Committee had been given the opportunity to make any discretionary adjustments that were provided under the program. Accordingly, we have determined the measurement date for the awards for the 1996 and 1997 programs should have been the date of the first Board meetings after the completion of the audits for those years. For the 1998 and 1999 program years, however, shares were awarded before the end of each year apparently in anticipation of annual results. For 1998 and 1999, we have determined that the measurement date should have been the date that a list of the awards was provided to our transfer agent for the issuance of shares which occurred in December 1998 and 1999, respectively. The aggregate compensation expense related to these errors on restricted stock is $0.7 million. Errors related to incomplete list of awards on options grant date $0.3 million. On April 17, 2000, we awarded to most US based employees options to purchase an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of common stock, primarily based upon length of service criteria. Due to the financial difficulties we were 34 Table of Contents experiencing at that time, the broad issuance of options was in lieu of cash bonuses normally paid at that time of the year. The option grant date coincided with the public release of audited financial statements for the 1999 calendar year. Although the majority of awards were based on length of service criteria for each individual, there were sufficient exceptions made to that criteria in establishing the final list of awards that we have determined the appropriate measurement date for these awards should have been the date when such lists were final and provided to the third party who was responsible for generating individual option agreements. The compensation expense related to this error was $0.3 million. Because of the existence of ambiguous documentation and information, we are providing the following sensitivity analysis related to the April 17, 2000 option grants. The determination by the Special Committee and our management of the appropriate measurement date for the stock option grants on April 17, 2000 was based upon the best available information as described above. There is, however, some circumstantial evidence that could suggest that a communication to the recipients on February 18, 2000 was sufficient to result in a grant on that date and that the subsequent award on April 17, 2000 was essentially a re pricing of a February 18, 2000 grant, resulting in the options needing to be treated as variable awards until January 1, 2006, the date we adopted SFAS 123(R). The cumulative impact of such interpretation through December 31, 2005 would be $7.2 million of incremental compensation expense before any related tax effects. Inaccurate measurement dates for certain stock options and restricted shares granted between July 1, 2000 and February 4, 2005. During the period from July 1, 2000 through December 31, 2006 we issued a total of 18.9 million stock options, with 7.2 million issued to officers for either retention or bonus purposes, 7.3 million issued to employees other than officers for either retention or bonus purposes, 1.4 million issued in connection with acquisitions, 1.2 million related to the 2000 hiring of Earl Lewis, our President and Chief Executive Officer, 0.9 million issued to non employee directors and 0.9 million shares issued for other purposes, primarily related to hiring of employees. We have determined that inaccurate measurement dates were used during the period from July 1, 2000 through February 4, 2005 related to 7.0 million options issued for retention and bonuses purposes, with 4.1 million and 2.9 million for officers and employees, respectively. We have also determined that extensions of time given to two former employees to exercise options should have been accounted for differently. The discussion following each of the italicized headings below provides further details of the types of errors identified and accounts for the $10.7 million of additional compensation expense arising from awards between July 1, 2000 and December 31, 2006. Errors related to incomplete list of awards on options grant date $6.5 million. We have identified three instances where lists of stock option recipients approved by the Compensation Committee were either incomplete or subsequently modified, as follows: On December 27, 2001, the Compensation Committee awarded options to purchase 2.8 million shares of common stock to officers for bonus purposes at an exercise price of $9.25. The Compensation Committee award was made with an understanding that there were 3.0 million shares available under our 1992 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1992 Plan). Shortly thereafter, we determined that the number of shares available under the 1992 Plan was actually 2.5 million shares. In order to remain in compliance with the 1992 Plan, the officers voluntarily agreed to forfeit certain of the options awarded to them. The final award of 2.4 million options was determined at the time of the next meeting of the Compensation Committee, which was February 12, 2002. The market price of our common stock on that day was $11.73. We have determined that the measurement date for these option grants should have been February 12, 2002 when the list of awards was final. The compensation expense related to these grants is $5.9 million. 35 Table of Contents On January 8, 2004, the Compensation Committee approved the issuance of 1.8 million stock options to a pool of employees. The market price on that day was $19.58. The complete list of option recipients and the number of options awarded to each recipient was not final until February 17, 2004 when the market price was $19.94. We have determined the measurement date for these option grants should have been February 17, 2004 and are thus recognizing compensation expense for these grants of $0.6 million. On February 4, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the award of 1.1 million stock options to a list of employees at an exercise price of $31.40. Because there were modifications made to the list subsequent to the Compensation Committees meeting, we have determined the measurement date for these grants should have been February 28, 2005 when the list was final and all employees were notified of their individual awards. However, since the market price on that day was $31.25, no compensation expense is required to be recognized. Error related to failure to recognize performance criteria on stock options $3.0 million. On January 1, 2001, we awarded shares of restricted stock to our officers that had vesting provisions based upon the attainment of certain financial results for that year. On September 7, 2001, our Chief Executive Officer submitted a proposal to the Compensation Committee to convert the shares of restricted stock to stock options. On September 12, 2001, the Compensation Committee approved the proposal and awarded 0.7 million stock options to our US officers. The market price on that day was $7.22. However, the Special Committee determined that the Compensation Committee intended to apply the performance criteria in place for the restricted stock grants to the stock options. Since one of the restrictions deemed intended by the Compensation Committee related to the completion of the audit for fiscal 2001, we have determined that the measurement date for these grants should have been February 12, 2002 when the Board met and accepted the audited 2001 financial statements. Accordingly, and based on the market price of $11.73 on that day, we are recognizing compensation expense of $3.0 million. Error related to extension of time to exercise stock options $1.0 million. During 2001, we allowed two individuals an extension of time to exercise vested stock options past the time provided for in their option agreements. We have determined that the extension of time resulted in a new award for those individuals and we should have recognized compensation expense for the fair value of such new awards on the dates when the respective shares would have been cancelled. The compensation expense recognized for these new awards is $1.0 million. Error related to stock options granted subject to shareholder approval of option plan $0.1 million. On February 12, 2002, the Compensation Committee awarded options to purchase 1.0 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $11.73 to officers contingent upon shareholder approval of a new stock option plan at our Annual Meeting to be held on April 24, 2002. The plan was approved and the options issued. However, since the options were subject to the shareholders approval of the plan, the measurement date should have been the day of the approval when the market price was $11.81. Consequently, we are recognizing compensation expense of $0.1 million for these grants. Other Adjustments and Reclassifications We have also adjusted previously recognized deferred tax assets that were originally recorded as a credit through additional paid in capital (shareholders equity) in previous periods as a result of certain stock options that did not qualify as deductible performance based compensation in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 162(m). The adjustments primarily impact previously reported net operating loss carryforwards and the amount of deferred tax assets and accrued income taxes reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since the 36 Table of Contents original tax benefit of these items was recorded through shareholders equity, there is no impact to the previously reported Consolidated Statements of Income related to the resulting section 162(m) limitations. The section 162(m) limitations resulted in a cumulative reduction in net operating losses of $33.5 million and a cumulative increase in income taxes payable, net of tax credit utilization, of $8.9 million as of December 31, 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, goodwill impairment, warranty obligations, contingencies, income taxes and stock based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition. The majority of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations, pursuant to guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2003. We typically design, market and sell our products primarily as commercial, off the shelf products. Many of our Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems customers, particularly those who use our airborne systems, request different system configurations, based on standard options or accessories that we offer. In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria. In those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate the system meets those specifications prior to shipment. For any contracts with multiple elements (i.e., training, installation, additional parts) undelivered at the end of a reporting period, we recognize revenue on the delivered elements only after we have determined that the delivered elements have stand alone value and any undelivered elements have objective and reliable evidence of fair value. The recognition of revenue on contracts with multiple elements is consistent with guidance provided by EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectibility is reasonably assured. We also have a limited number of design and development contracts, principally with governmental customers, that are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1). Under SOP 81 1, revenues and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method. Allowance for doubtful accounts. Our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits. We regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customers account balance becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is 37 Table of Contents determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. Actual write offs during the past three years have been insignificant. We also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2006, our accounts receivable balance of $167.5 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1.6 million. We believe our reported allowances at December 31, 2006, are adequate. If the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate, however, resulting in their inability to make payments, we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made. Inventory write downs. As a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems, we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures in products and prices, and the availability of key components from our suppliers. Our policy is to record inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. When recorded, our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis. As of December 31, 2006, our inventories of $135.9 million are stated net of inventory write downs of $16.2 million. If actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future. Goodwill impairment. We have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions. We review goodwill in June of each year, or on an interim basis if required, for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundaries of the market capitalization of the applicable business divisions of the Company. Our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets, which have a carrying value of $159.8 million as of December 31, 2006. Product warranties. Our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time, generally twelve months, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized. We believe that our recorded liability of $5.2 million at December 31, 2006, is adequate to cover our future cost of materials, labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date. If actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly. Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. 38 Table of Contents Income taxes. We record our deferred tax assets when the benefits are probable of being recognized, at an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future. In making that determination, on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon, but not limited to, general economic conditions, competitive pressures, and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2006, we have determined that no valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $18.9 million is required. If we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made. Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004(As Restated) Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 45.2 45.6 48.4 Gross profit 54.8 54.4 51.6 Operating expenses: Research and development 10.5 10.1 9.5 Selling, general and administrative 20.5 19.5 19.8 Total operating expenses 31.0 29.6 29.3 Earnings from operations 23.8 24.8 22.3 Interest expense 1.6 1.6 1.7 Interest income (0.6 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Other (income) expense, net (0.3 ) (0.3 ) 0.3 Earnings before income taxes 23.1 24.0 20.4 Income tax provision 5.6 6.2 5.8 Net earnings 17.5 % 17.8 % 14.6 % Years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Revenue. Revenue for 2006 totaled $575.0 million, an increase of 13.1 percent over the $508.6 million of revenue in 2005. Revenue from the Thermography business segment increased 19.4 percent from $183.6 million in 2005 to $219.2 million in 2006. The increase in Thermography revenue was primarily due to sales of the InfraCAM product which was launched in 2006 and increased unit sales in most of our other product lines. Revenue from the Government Systems business segment increased 7.1 percent from $241.4 million in 2005 to $258.4 million in 2006. The increase in Government Systems revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales of gimbaled products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of hand held and fixed mounted products. Revenue from the Commercial Vision Systems business segment increased 16.4 percent from $83.6 million in 2005 to $97.3 million in 2006. The increase in Commercial Vision Systems revenue was due to increased unit sales across all product lines. Revenue for 2005 totaled $508.6 million, an increase of 5.4 percent over the $482.7 million in revenue in 2004. Revenue from the Thermography business segment increased 17.7 percent from $156.0 million in 2004 to $183.6 million in 2005. The increase in Thermography revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes, particularly of E Series and OEM products due to new markets and applications being identified and addressed. 39 Table of Contents Revenue from the Government Systems business segment decreased 3.6 percent from $250.3 in 2004 to $241.4 million in 2005. The decrease in Government Systems revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales of land based products, partially offset by an increase in airborne products. Revenue from the Commercial Vision Systems business segment increased 9.4 percent from $76.4 million in 2004 to $83.6 million in 2005. The increase in Commercial Vision Systems revenue was primarily due to increased unit sales across all product lines. International revenue in 2006 totaled $259.9 million, representing 45.2 percent of revenue. This compares to international revenue in 2005 which totaled $221.7 million, representing 43.6 percent of revenue, and $201.5 million, or 41.8 percent of revenue in 2004. While the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly from year to year, we anticipate the mix to be approximately 55 percent to 60 percent domestic and 40 percent to 45 percent international on a long term basis. Gross profit. Gross profit in 2006 was 54.8 percent of revenue, compared to 54.4 percent of revenue in 2005. The slight increase in gross profit was primarily due to the product mix within our three business segments and cost efficiencies in our Santa Barbara operations, offset by stock based compensation expense of $1.2 million included in our 2006 cost of goods sold. Gross profit in 2005 was 54.4 percent of revenue, compared to 51.6 percent in 2004. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the product mix within our three business segments, our ability to lower component costs, including successfully integrating Indigo sensors into our products, production efficiencies at our facilities, and $1.3 million of expense in 2004 related to the recognition of the one time stepped up values of the acquired inventories of Indigo. We historically experience higher gross margins in our Thermography business than in our Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems businesses. Thermography represented 36.1 percent of total revenue in 2005 compared to 32.3 percent in 2004. Research and development. Research and development expenses were $60.6 million, or 10.5 percent of revenue, in 2006 compared to $51.5 million, or 10.1 percent of revenue, in 2005. The increase in research and development expenses was due to the continued investment in new product development in all business segments to enable future growth and the impact of stock based compensation expense of $3.1 million in 2006. We believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 10 percent of revenue on a long term basis. Research and development expenses were $51.5 million, or 10.1 percent of revenue, in 2005 compared to $45.8 million, or 9.5 percent of revenue, in 2004. The increase in spending in 2005 was due to the continued investment in new products and engineering to enable future growth. We have also incurred expenses associated with customer funded design and development contracts. Such expenses were $11.6 million in 2006, $10.6 million in 2005 and $12.4 million in 2004. These expenses are reported as cost of goods sold since the related funding is reported as revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $117.4 million, or 20.5 percent of revenue, in 2006 compared to $99.2 million, or 19.5 percent of revenue in 2005. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to the continued growth in the business, including costs associated with new product launches, and stock based compensation expense of $6.6 million in 2006. We anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.2 million, or 19.5 percent of revenue in 2005 compared to $95.6 million, or 19.8 percent of revenue in 2004. 40 Table of Contents Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $9.0 million, $7.9 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the accrual of interest on the convertible notes that were issued in June 2003 and the amortization of costs related to the issuance of the notes. The small increase in interest expense in 2006 relates to credit line borrowings in the third quarter of 2006 to fund repurchases of our common shares. Interest income. Interest income was $3.4 million, $2.6 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in interest income since 2004 was primarily due to an increase in invested cash. Other income/expense. We reported other income of $1.3 million for 2006, $1.5 million for 2005, and other expenses of $1.6 million for 2004. The other income/expense is primarily currency gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our European operations. Income taxes. Our income tax provision was $31.7 million, $31.5 million, and $27.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 23.9%, 25.7%, and 28.3%, respectively. The mix in taxable income between our US and foreign operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years. Our effective tax rate is lower than the US Federal tax rate of 35 percent because of lower foreign tax rates, the effect of foreign tax credits and other federal and state tax credits. The 2006 effective tax rate was reduced by 2.7% as a result of the recognition of foreign tax credits. At December 31, 2006, we had US tax net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) totaling approximately $3.3 million and state tax NOLs totaling approximately $28.8 million which expire in the years 2019 through 2025. Additionally, we have various state tax credits available aggregating $1.3 million (net of federal benefit), which expire in the years 2008 through 2026. We have generated deductions for US tax purposes related to the exercise of stock options that have served to offset the reductions in our NOLs. The utilization of these stock option exercise deductions is accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in our income tax provision. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets when the benefits are probable of being recognized. To the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. Based on this guidance, we believe that the net deferred tax assets of $18.9 million reflected on the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, are realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and therefore, we have not recorded a valuation allowance. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions, including but not limited to continued growth of all of our business markets, competitive pressures on sales and gross margins, successful implementation of tax planning strategies, and other factors beyond our control. Absolute assurance can not be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if our forecasts of taxable income are not achieved. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2006, we had $138.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $107.1 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash provided from operations, proceeds from our credit agreement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the repurchase of approximately 4.7 million shares of our common stock and capital expenditures. Cash provided by operating activities in 2006 totaled $115.2 million compared to $73.1 million in 2005. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net earnings, increased collections of accounts receivables and a decrease in current assets, partially offset by an increase in inventories. 41 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, we had accounts receivable in the amount of $167.5 million compared to $142.8 million at December 31, 2005. The increase of $24.7 million in the receivable balance was primarily due to the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had inventories of $135.9 million compared to $103.8 million at December 31, 2005. The 30.9 percent increase in inventories was primarily due to the increase of product offerings in each of our segments and the general growth in those segments, including anticipated growth in 2007. At December 31, 2006, we had prepaid expenses and other current assets of $29.2 million compared to $33.2 million at December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income taxes receivable, partially offset by an increase in sales demonstration units. Our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $43.4 million, primarily consisting of capital expenditures, including the purchase of a facility in Orlando, Florida and expansions and improvements in most of our manufacturing facilities. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $52.9 million, primarily arising from the purchase of the Wilsonville, Oregon property, and other capital expenditures, and the acquisition of Brysen Optical Corporation and Scientific Materials Corporation. Accounts payable increased from $34.5 million at December 31, 2005 to $40.6 million at December 31, 2006. The increase primarily relates to the increase in inventories. Accrued payroll and related liabilities increased from $22.2 million at December 31, 2005 to $25.8 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the timing of payroll payments. On October 6, 2006, we signed a Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association and other Lenders. This Credit Agreement replaces our previous credit agreement dated April 28, 2004. The Credit Agreement provides for a $300 million, five year revolving line of credit. We have the right, subject to certain conditions including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the line of credit by an additional $150 million until October 6, 2011. The Credit Agreement includes a $100 million sublimit multicurrency option, permitting us and certain of our designated subsidiaries to borrow in Euro, Kroner, Sterling and other agreed upon currencies. Under the Credit Agreement, borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the Bank of America or Eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread under/over Eurodollar rates based upon the Companys leverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate ranged from 6.10 percent to 8.25 percent. The Credit Agreement contains five financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, in addition to minimum levels of EBITDA and consolidated net worth, a maximum level of capital expenditures and commencing December 31, 2009 a minimum liquidity of cash and availability under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. At December 31, 2006, we had $45.5 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement and were in compliance with all the financial covenants. We had $5.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2006, which reduces the total available credit. Our Sweden subsidiary has a 30 million Swedish Kroner (approximately $4.4 million) line of credit at 3.70 percent at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding on this line of credit. The 30 million Swedish Kroner line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of the Sweden subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis. In June 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0 percent senior convertible notes due 2023 in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The issuance was made through an initial offering of $175 million on June 11, 2003, and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional $35 million on June 17, 2003. The net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $203.9 million. Issuance costs are being amortized over a period of seven years. Interest is payable semiannually 42 Table of Contents on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 45.0612 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes prior to the maturity date in certain circumstances. We may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after June 8, 2010. The proceeds were used primarily for general corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of Indigo and other working capital and capital expenditure needs. During the quarter ended September 30, 2004, one of the terms that allow for conversion of our convertible notes, as described in the prospectus, was met. As of December 31, 2006, no note holders have elected to convert their notes into our stock. We do not anticipate any conversions before 2010. We believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities, and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements. We also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements. Except for these operating lease agreements, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2006, our contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than 5 Years Long term debt $ 210,024 $ 7 $ 15 $ 2 $ 210,000 Interest on long term debt 103,425 6,300 12,600 12,600 71,925 Credit agreement 45,500 45,500 Interest on credit agreement 977 977 Operating leases 34,578 7,043 11,879 8,919 6,737 Licensing rights 5,400 250 1,025 1,100 3,025 Post retirement obligations 10,442 429 1,535 2,045 6,433 $ 410,346 $ 60,506 $ 27,054 $ 24,666 $ 298,120 Principal and interest obligations on our long term debt are based upon the assumption that all convertible notes are held to their maturity in 2023. Post retirement obligations are based upon actuarial assumptions. Actual payments may differ in terms of both timing and amounts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. The credit agreements are at variable rates. A change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest 43 Table of Contents incurred and cash flows. At December 31, 2006, we had $45.5 million outstanding on our credit agreement. It is our intent to repay the $45.5 million outstanding in full by the end of the third quarter of 2007. We have determined that any change in interest rates during the first six months of 2007 will not materially impact our financial statements. Our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0 percent. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. The fair value of the notes at December 31, 2006, was approximately $322.0 million compared to a carrying value of $207.0 million. We have assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the United States that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are denominated in foreign currencies. Assets and liabilities located outside the United States are primarily located in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are considered long term. We do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. Because we market, sell and license our products throughout the world, we could be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products. Our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into US dollars using the period end exchange rates at December 31, 2006, was approximately $211.6 million. The potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $21.2 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries. The Company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings.
