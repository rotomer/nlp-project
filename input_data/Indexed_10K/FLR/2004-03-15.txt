In November 2000, a spin off distribution to shareholders was effected which separated then existing Fluor Corporation into two publicly traded companies new Fluor (Fluor or the company) and Massey Energy Company (Massey). Masseys results of operations for all periods prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations. In September 2001, the company adopted a plan to dispose of certain non core construction equipment and temporary staffing businesses. The assets and liabilities (including debt) and results of operations of Massey and the non core businesses for all periods presented have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations. In addition, the company changed to a calendar year basis of reporting financial results in connection with the spin off. See Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 14 to 28 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F 6 to F 34 for information relating to significant items affecting the results of operations. 13 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non operating income and expense items; earnings or loss from discontinued operations; and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The company reports financial results on a calendar year basis for all periods subsequent to December 31, 2000. Accounting Pronouncements Following is a discussion of the impact of recent accounting and financial reporting pronouncements that have been applied in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. This information is provided to assist in an understanding of the impact such changes have had on the companys financial reporting. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Under SFAS 144, a component of a business that is held for sale is reported in discontinued operations if (i) the operations and cash flows will be, or have been, eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and, (ii) the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in such operations. In the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2001. In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was completed in 2003 with the disposition of the last remaining operation in the construction equipment business. The operating results for discontinued operations are discussed later in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These statements were effective for the companys calendar year 2002. Under the new rules, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. During 2003, the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and has determined that none of the goodwill is impaired. Application of the non amortization provisions resulted in an increase in earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 million ($0.04 per diluted share) in 2002 and 2003 compared with 2001. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The Statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Application of this statement did not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in 2003. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 expands on the accounting and disclosure requirements under existing accounting standards. It clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation. Disclosures required by the Interpretation are provided below in the Financial Position and Liquidity section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. The accounting requirements of the Interpretation are applicable to transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2003. Application of this Interpretation did not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in 2003. 14 Table of Contents In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R). FIN 46 R provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Certain of the companys engineering office facilities are leased through arrangements involving variable interest entities. Beginning in 2003, the company now consolidates these entities in its financial statements as prescribed by FIN 46 R. At December 31, 2003, the effect of this consolidation resulted in an increase of $100 million and $27 million in reported short term and long term debt, respectively, and an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment of $107 million. None of the terms of the leasing arrangements or the companys obligations as a lessee were impacted by this change in accounting. The cumulative impact of the difference in earnings, amounting to a charge of $10.4 million net of tax, relating to prior years was reported in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The company may also use variable interest entities from time to time to facilitate financing of various projects. There are no such financing entities in use at the present time. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards. In April 2003 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 149, Amendments of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 149). SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 149 did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. On May 15, 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150). SFAS 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. SFAS 150 did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts. Engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total 15 Table of Contents estimated contract costs. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor costs and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, or achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract costs and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 60 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while approximately 40 percent was for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues realized from the project. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made certain claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and costs, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures. Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues, costs and operating profits in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet. The most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the Power segment. This segment includes Duke/ Fluor Daniel and ICA Fluor Daniel. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles. Foreign Currency. The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in 16 Table of Contents exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the company did not have any significant forward exchange contracts. The company does not engage in currency speculation. In connection with the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project located in Jose, Venezuela, the company has incurred foreign currency exposures and related translation losses due to weakness in the Venezuelan Bolivar compared with the U.S. dollar. See additional discussion concerning the Hamaca project below under Results of Operations Oil & Gas. Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2003 the company had deferred tax assets of $288.8 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $63.7 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $40.5 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards, net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain project performance reserves. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Retirement Benefits. The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Recent decreases in long term interest rates have the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund approximately $30 to $50 million for the calendar year 2004. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $25 million. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Revenue declined 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to declines in the Power and Oil & Gas segments. Earnings from continuing operations increased 4.7 percent to $2.23 per share in 2003 compared with $2.13 per share in 2002. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to reduced corporate administrative and general expense and a lower tax rate on earnings from continuing operations. Lower segment operating profit, primarily in the Power segment, and lower net interest income partially offset these improvements. The company has experienced a significant decline in Power segment revenue and earnings as most projects in the segment were completed and not replaced by new awards. The decline in new awards in the Power segment over the last two years reflects a cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction. Partially offsetting this trend in Power is an increasing trend for new awards in the Oil & Gas and Government segments. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in the early stages of a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next three to five years. In addition, the trend for new awards in the Government segment have increased due to awards for work in Iraq as well as the completion of two niche acquisitions that improves the companys service offering to both the Department of Defense and Department of State. Revenue increased 11 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to an increase in the Oil & Gas segment. Earnings from continuing operations increased 32 percent to $2.13 per share in 2002 compared with 17 Table of Contents $1.61 per share in 2001. This increase is partially due to a net $15.2 million ($0.19 per share) charge for stock price driven compensation plan expense in 2001 due to the increase in stock price primarily in the first quarter of the year. Excluding the stock price charge, the increase in earnings from continuing operations in 2002 compared with 2001 was 18.9 percent. This increase is primarily due to significantly improved operating profit performance in the Power segment as earnings were recognized on completed projects that were awarded in prior years. The company had net earnings of $1.95 per share in 2003 compared with $2.05 in 2002 and $0.25 in 2001. Results in 2003 were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of $0.15 per share and a loss of $0.13 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results in 2002 and 2001 include losses from discontinued operations of $0.08 per share and $1.36 per share, respectively. The results of discontinued operations is further discussed below. The loss from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is discussed above under Accounting Pronouncements. Following is a discussion of the operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items. The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance. During the first quarter of 2003, the company realigned certain operations to increase focus on the chemicals market. Projects in this market were formerly in the Energy & Chemicals segment and will now be executed and reported in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment. The Energy & Chemicals segment was renamed Oil & Gas and all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. The company is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil & Gas segment provides engineering and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides engineering and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities, commercial and institutional buildings, mining, chemicals, telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities. The Government segment provides project management engineering, construction, and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, construction equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services. The Power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities. Services provided by the Power segment are conducted through two joint ventures; Duke/ Fluor Daniel, a 50 percent owned partnership with Duke Energy, and ICA Fluor Daniel, a 49 percent owned joint venture with Grupo ICA, a Mexican company. The results of segment operations as reported herein have been conformed to the organizational alignment discussed above for all periods presented. Oil & Gas. Revenue in the Oil & Gas segment amounted to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 representing a decrease of 24 percent over revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenue for the 2002 period increased 54 percent compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in revenue during 2003 reflects the completion of several projects during the year and revenue recognition from projects awarded in 2003 did not fully replace the revenue on the completed projects. The revenue increase in 2002 compared with 2001 reflects the increase in work performed on projects in the full execution stage compared with revenue primarily from front end studies and preliminary engineering in the 2001 period. Operating profit margin in the Oil & Gas segment increased in 2003 to 4.6 percent compared with 3.7 percent in 2002 due to the higher content of project completions combined with improved execution performance. Operating profit margin in 2002 was lower than the 4.5 percent that was achieved in 2001 due to the impact of projects moving to full execution from the higher margin front end studies and preliminary engineering work performed in 2001. A major ongoing project in the Oil & Gas segment in 2003 is the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project (Hamaca) located in Jose, Venezuela. Hamaca is a $1.1 billion lump sum project (including $92 million of approved change orders) of Grupo Alvica (GA), a joint venture including Fluor Daniel (80 percent) and Inelectra C.A. (20 percent), to design and build a petroleum upgrader for a consortium of owners called Petrolera Ameriven (PA) including Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips. 18 Table of Contents The joint venture is actively pursuing two cost and schedule relief issues that were referred to arbitration in December 2001: the first is responsibility for costs arising from the site labor agreement for 2000 called Acta Convenio and the second relates to modifications and extra work arising from differing site soil conditions. The hearings on the fundamental cost differences between the earlier 1998 labor agreement and the 2000 Acta Convenio were held in April 2003. The site soil conditions issue was the subject of hearings in November 2002. There are no monetary cross claims by PA in the arbitration. Events in Venezuela including a national strike in early 2003 have had a significant impact on the progress of the project. In accordance with the contract, the joint venture is entitled to cost and schedule relief for the impact of the national strike. A change order relating to the national strike in the approximate amount of $340 million was submitted by GA. This action was followed by the filing of an arbitration claim relating to this issue in January 2004. A time schedule for the resolution of the claim will be established by the arbitration panel in the near future. Force majeure incidents occurring prior to the national strike also were the subject of arbitration hearings in October 2003. The arbitration panel, by procedural order dated January 8, 2004, has ordered PA to refrain from taking any action to seek liquidated delay damages, making claim against or drawing down on a Letter of Credit, terminating the contract with GA, or making any demands pursuant to any guarantee provisions in the contract, pending completion of the site soil conditions issues. The award on the site soils conditions matter is anticipated in the near future. The client has conditionally accepted responsibility relating to the soil conditions and $28 million of incurred costs has been paid. The amount of the claim for site soil conditions is $159 million including the $28 million conditional payment. The company is accounting for the additional costs incurred for the soil conditions matter as additional revenue as payments are received. The amount of the claim for Acta Convenio is $210 million and no payments have been made by the client relating to this matter. Incurred costs associated with Acta Convenio, soil conditions, the recent national strike and other claims are probable of being recovered and thus are being deferred. These costs will be recognized in revenue when a change order is approved or payment is received. As of December 31, 2003, incurred costs amounting to $179.6 million have been deferred. Substantial additional costs are expected to be incurred as the project progresses and resolution of outstanding issues concerning the total amount to be awarded and schedule extensions are yet to be determined. If costs relating to Acta Convenio, soil conditions, the recent national strike or other claims are determined to be not recoverable, the company could face reduced profits or losses on this project, along with lower levels of cash and additional borrowings. The project remains subject to future disruptions that could result in additional costs and claims. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $3.7 billion in 2003 compared to $1.9 billion in 2002. New project awards in 2003 include the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project, a major oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. The TCO project was expected to be awarded in 2002 but was temporarily suspended due to funding considerations, which were resolved early in 2003. Also included in new awards in 2003 is the Sakhalin I program and construction management project led by ExxonMobil and a project for Lukoil, a major Russian oil company. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $1.9 billion in 2002, a decline of 13 percent over 2001. The 2002 decline was primarily due to the previously mentioned temporary suspension of the TCO project. The large size and uncertain timing of complex, international projects can create variability in the segments award pattern; consequently, future award trends are difficult to predict with certainty. Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment increased to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002. This increase is due to the higher level of new awards in 2003 and the lower level of work performed on these new awards as they are in the early stages of project execution where activity is focused on engineering and project planning. Backlog declined to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $3.7 billion at December 31, 2001. The 2002 decline in backlog primarily is the result of the temporary suspension in 2002 of the TCO project that was awarded in early 2003 as discussed above. Industrial & Infrastructure. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment had revenues of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an 8 percent increase compared with the previous year. This increase primarily reflects the higher volume of work performed on life sciences projects awarded in 2002 partially offset by lower volume of work performed on mining projects as a number of projects were completed in 2002 19 Table of Contents and not replaced with new awards. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment had revenues of $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 essentially flat with the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001. Operating profit for the segment was impacted in both 2003 and 2002 by provisions relating to projects awarded in previous years. In 2003 operating profit was negatively impacted by a pre tax provision of $7.4 million relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in Australia. The investment was committed in previous years as part of a consulting arrangement with the client where the company agreed to be compensated for its services in shares of the clients capital stock. Due to funding considerations, continued development of the project was suspended resulting in the client seeking bankruptcy protection. Because the company was not the execution contractor there was no impact on backlog or operating results from project execution. A pre tax $26 million dispute resolution provision in 2002 primarily relates to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on the Verde Gold project in Chile, a gold ore processing facility completed in 1996. During the second quarter of 2002, the company recognized a loss provision of $20 million representing the arbitration award plus applicable interest, less a $3 million reserve provided in prior years. The company anticipates recovering a portion of the award from available insurance and has recorded $6 million in expected insurance recoveries. The net impact on results of operations for 2002 was a charge of $14 million. The 2003 operating profit margin in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment was essentially flat with 2002. These results are substantially below results achieved in 2001 primarily due to the provisions discussed above. In 2003 margins were also lower due to the increased volume of construction management work and lack of project margin on projects that were removed from backlog which are discussed below. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $2.6 billion compared with $3.5 billion in 2002. New awards in 2002 included a substantial award for the SH 130 toll road project in Texas. In addition, new awards in 2003 were lower than 2002 and 2001 due to continuing economic weakness in the mining, telecommunications and manufacturing markets reflecting overcapacity and poor commodity pricing in these industries. Backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment declined to $3.3 billion compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2002. Contributing to this decline was the removal of $750 million for three projects that had been booked during the previous two years. One of these was a mining project that was removed due to considerations relating to ongoing financing. The other two were commercial projects that the company decided to not execute due to evolving changes in industry liability. The increase in backlog to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2001 reflects the strong increase particularly in life sciences and transportation awards in 2002. Government. The Government segment had revenues of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with revenue of $1.0 billion in 2002. This 78 percent increase is primarily due to the substantial increase in work performed for the Department of Defense on the Midcourse Missile Defense test bed facilities in Alaska, the Department of State for an embassy project in Brazil and new awards for task orders in Iraq. Also contributing to the increase was revenue from Del Jen which was acquired early in 2003. Government segment revenue in 2002 increased 17 percent over revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001. The revenue increase in 2002 primarily reflects higher activity levels on projects being executed for the Department of Energy (DOE). Revenue in all periods includes work for ongoing environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project in Ohio and the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. Operating profit margin for the Government segment declined to 2.8 percent in 2003 compared with 3.1 percent in 2002. Contributing to this decline was the impact of a particularly high level of proposal activity during the year as the segment pursued a number of new opportunities. The operating profit margin of 3.1 percent in 2002 compares with 2.7 percent in 2001. This improvement is attributable to improved project execution and realization of performance incentives on the DOE contracts, activity on the Midcourse Missile Defense test bed facilities in Alaska and increased logistical support activities internationally. In addition, good performance on the Fernald contract led to a re baselining of the project, which favorably impacted operating profit in 2003 and the last half of 2002. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government 20 Table of Contents clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months. In January 2003, the company acquired Del Jen, Inc. (Del Jen), a leading provider of services to the Departments of Defense and Labor. The acquisition will expand the companys ability to provide services in the government outsourcing market. Del Jen was acquired for $33.3 million in cash of which $24 million was recognized as goodwill and $3.2 million was recognized as intangible assets. In November 2003, the company acquired the International Division of J.A. Jones Construction Company (J.A. Jones), which provides design build and construction services to the U.S. Government. This acquisition will further expand the companys portfolio of government business. The acquisition did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. Total assets in the Government segment increased to $475 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $128 million at December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Del Jen with total assets of $60.4 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the segment has unbilled fees totaling $39.3 million related to the Fernald project. The project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in 2007. Deferred fees recognized in revenue in 2003 and 2002 were $21.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in segment assets was a significant increase in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to work performed in the Middle East. Global Services. The Global Services segment had revenues of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, up 15 percent compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenue for 2002 was 6 percent lower than revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in revenue in 2003 is partially due to the acquisition of Plant Performance Services (P2S) at the end of the first quarter. The revenue decline in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflects the impact of increased selectivity to improve margins and depressed economic conditions resulting in lower operations and maintenance activity in the manufacturing sector. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 8.7 percent compared with 9.7 percent in 2002 and 4.9 percent in 2001. The reduced margin in 2003 is partially attributable to lower contribution from P2S and construction related services reflecting the lower volume in Power and Oil & Gas activities. The improvement in 2002 compared with the prior period is primarily attributable to the procurement services business which incurred substantial amounts of development and start up expenses in 2001. In March 2003, the company acquired five specialty operations and maintenance (O&M) business groups from Philip Services Corporation. The acquired businesses, which were named Plant Performance Services (P2S), will expand and strengthen the O&M services business component of the Global Services segment and complement the companys core engineering, procurement and construction business. The business groups were acquired for $21.2 million in cash which excluded working capital. During the period from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2003, approximately $44 million of working capital has been provided to the business to fund operations. As of December 31, 2003, the allocation of the purchase price has not been finalized pending valuation of assets acquired through independent appraisals. New awards in the Global Services segment for operations and maintenance projects were $1.3 billion, an increase of 23 percent over 2002. This increase is primarily due to the contribution from P2S. The 17 percent decline in new awards in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily attributable to increased selectivity and the depressed economic conditions in the manufacturing sector. Backlog for the Global Services segment has been fairly stable at $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This relative stability is due in part to the multi year nature of operations and maintenance contracts where consistent and efficient performance results in long term client relationships. The equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. 21 Table of Contents Power. The Power segment experienced a significant decline in revenue to $759 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $2.2 billion in 2002 and $2.5 billion in 2001. This decline is due to the substantial work off of nearly all projects in backlog that were awarded in prior years. As mentioned previously, the segment has experienced a substantial reduction in new awards over the last two years as demand for new power generation has diminished following a strong cycle of power plant construction activity. Operating profit margin in the Power segment was a very strong 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with 4.9 percent in 2002 and 3.0 percent in 2001. The strong performance in 2003 is attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of projects. Projects in the Power segment are primarily bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. On July 9, 2003, the company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation the decision to terminate the Duke/ Fluor Daniel partnership (D/ FD) as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. A joint plan among the partners is being developed to dissolve the business over the next two years. The dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position of the company. The company will continue to identify power generation opportunities and any prospective projects will be performed 100 percent by Fluor. New awards in the Power segment were down substantially to $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $1.1 billion and $3.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The majority of new awards in 2003 will be executed by Fluor or ICA/ Fluor Daniel. Backlog for the Power segment decreased to $605 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $841 million and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Most of the projects awarded in prior years have now been completed or will be completed in 2004. New award activity for the near term future is expected to be modest as existing capacity is expected to meet anticipated demand. Corporate. Corporate administrative and general expenses totaled $141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This compares with $160.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $167.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The improvement in 2003 compared with 2002 is primarily due to the absence of charges relating to the reevaluation of the companys enterprise resource management (ERM) system, recognition of a provision for a guarantee obligation and a provision to recognize impairment related to an investment in The Beacon Group Energy Investment Fund, L.P. that were recognized in 2002. Partially offsetting these charges in 2002 was recognition of a gain relating to the demutualization of an insurance company in which the company had an investment. During 2002 significant cost reductions were realized as a result of the companys reevaluation of the scope of implementation and deployment of its ERM system (formerly known as Knowledge@Work). As part of this reevaluation effort the company altered the original ERM implementation plan and recognized a charge of $13.0 million in 2002 for abandonment of certain system functionality and to adjust depreciation expense. This charge partially offset the impact of the cost reductions realized upon changing the implementation and deployment plan. Stock based compensation expense in 2002 was $25.3 million lower compared with 2001 primarily as a result of a significant increase in the trading price of the companys common stock during the first half of 2001. The impact of changes in the stock price in 2003 and 2002 did not have a significant impact on stock based compensation expense as exercises, retirements and conversions have reduced the number of stock price sensitive units outstanding. During 2002 overhead cost reductions were realized as a result of the early retirement of two former senior executives at the end of 2001 and the elimination of the Business Services and Other segment. This segment included the companys shared services operations. Shared services are grouped in corporate administrative and general expense for all periods presented. Net interest income was $3.2 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, compared with net interest expense of $0.9 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The reduction in net interest income in 2003 is the result of lower cash balances and increased short term borrowings 22 Table of Contents compared with 2002. The increase in net interest income in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily due to the elimination of short term borrowings. The effective tax rates on the companys continuing operations were 33.0 percent, 34.8 percent and 31.1 percent, for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the tax rate in 2003 compared with 2002 is primarily due to the utilization of certain capital loss carryforwards coupled with reduced foreign losses without tax benefit. In addition, during 2003 the company had favorable tax return adjustments and settlements which were partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance to adjust net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The tax rate in 2001 compared with 2002 was lower due to the tax benefits from tax settlements and the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Matters in Dispute Resolution. During 2003, several matters on certain completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of these matters: Murrin Murrin Disputes between Fluor Australia (Fluor) and its client, Anaconda Nickel (Anaconda), over the Murrin Murrin Nickel Cobalt project located in Western Australia were partially resolved through arbitration during the third quarter of 2002. The first phase of the arbitration hearing was completed in May 2002 and a decision was rendered in September 2002 resulting in an award to Anaconda of A$147 million (subsequently amended to A$150 million [US$84.0 million]) and an award to Fluor of A$107 million [US$59.9 million] for amounts owing from Anaconda under the contract. The company has recovered the first phase award plus substantially all defense costs incurred from available insurance. On July 28, 2003, the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia granted Anacondas appeal of an issue that had been decided in favor of Fluor by the arbitration panel in the first phase. This decision sends the arbitration panels denial of Anacondas claim for the cost of a fifth autoclave train back to the panel for further reconsideration. Fluor has appealed the Supreme Courts decision to the State of Victoria Court of Appeal. The second phase of the arbitration was heard in September 2003. A decision is expected in the third quarter of 2004. The company anticipates that any liability arising from proceedings under either the first or the second phase of arbitration, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, will be covered by available insurance. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. V. General Electric Company, et al U.S.D.C., Southern District Court, New York In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2004. Dearborn Industrial Project Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan. The initial Turnkey Agreement, dated November 24, 1998, consisted of three phases. Commencing shortly after Notice to Proceed, the owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. The Project has been severely delayed with completion of Phase II. DIG has unilaterally taken over completion and operation of Phase II and is commissioning that portion of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit which D/ FD expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute. D/ FD 23 Table of Contents retains lien rights (in fee) against the project. In October 2001, suit was commenced in Michigan State Court to foreclose on the lien interest. In December 2001, DIG filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to D/ FD claiming, among other things, that D/ FD is liable to DIG for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the Dearborn plant. The court has ordered the matter to arbitration. The lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of D/ FDs claims against DIG and DIGs claims against D/ FD. An arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration will likely proceed in early 2005. Butinge Nafta Oil Terminal On March 10, 2000, Butinge Nafta (Nafta) commenced arbitration proceedings against Fluor Daniel Intercontinental (FDI) concerning a bulk oil storage terminal (the Facility) located in Lithuania alleging, among other issues, that FDI represented costs in excess of actual estimates. FDI engineered, procured and managed the construction of the Facility on a lump sum basis. On June 21, 2000, Fluor filed a separate arbitration against Nafta to recover delay/disruption damages caused by Nafta, as well as compensation for out of scope services. The first hearing on the merits of the case was conducted in late May 2001 with an additional hearing in June 2002. Final legal submissions and arguments were completed in September 2002. In June 2003, FDI was issued a favorable award on its claims and Naftas major claims against FDI were dismissed with prejudice resulting in a net award to Fluor of $4.6 million. The resolution of this matter did not have a material effect on results of operations. Hamaca Crude Upgrader See discussion regarding the Hamaca project above under Oil & Gas. Strategic Reorganization Costs. In March 1999, the company reorganized its engineering and construction operations and recorded a special provision to cover direct and other reorganization related costs primarily for personnel, facilities and asset impairment adjustments. The plan was successfully implemented and carried out. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining unexpended reserve is $1.5 million and relates to non U.S. personnel costs that will be paid as follows: 2004 $0.8 million; 2005 $0.3 million; 2006 $0.2 million; 2007 $0.1 million; thereafter $0.1 million. Discontinued Operations. In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and non EPC components of its temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and is complete as of the end of 2003. Operating results for these non core businesses have been reclassified and are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During 2003 the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of $31.9 million. In 2002, the sale of one dealership subsidiary resulted in cash proceeds of $45.9 million. Other dealership asset disposals during 2002 produced proceeds of $51 million. In December 2001, the company sold one dealership entity for cash equal to its carrying value generating proceeds of $25.7 million. During the second quarter of 2002, the Australian operations of the temporary staffing operations of TRS were sold, resulting in cash proceeds of $5.1 million. The temporary staffing industry experienced severe competition in 2002 due to depressed economic conditions, which resulted in significant erosion in the fair value of the TRS businesses that were sold. As a result, the company recognized adjustments to the carrying value of TRSs U.S. and U.K. based disposal groups. The sales of the U.S. and U.K. operations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 resulting in proceeds of $2 million. Disposal of AMECO operations in Argentina and Peru were finalized in 2002 resulting in proceeds of $5.1 million primarily from collection of accounts receivable and sales of inventory and equipment. Interest expense was not reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with the non core businesses because disposal of these operations did not include any debt to be assumed by the buyers. 24 Table of Contents Revenue and the results of operations, including loss on disposal, for all discontinued operations are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Revenue Dealership operations $ 30,097 $ 155,909 $ 279,099 Other equipment operations 7,880 10,153 Temporary staffing operations 34 67,661 138,102 Total Revenue $ 30,131 $ 231,450 $ 427,354 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations: Dealership operations $ 2,575 $ 4,214 $ 13,569 Other equipment operations 117 213 (1,787 ) Temporary staffing operations (404 ) (4,036 ) (9,898 ) Earnings from discontinued operations before tax 2,288 391 1,884 Provision for taxes 800 891 1,632 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,488 $ (500 ) $ 252 Loss on disposal before tax $ (7,386 ) $ (8,770 ) $ (139,423 ) Provision for taxes (tax benefit) 5,718 (2,909 ) (30,815 ) Loss on disposal $ (13,104 ) $ (5,861 ) $ (108,608 ) The loss on disposal in all periods presented above is for impairment provisions to adjust the carrying value of the assets held for sale of the various individual non core businesses to fair value. Impairment provisions for the equipment operations included adjustments to the carrying value of equipment inventories, fixed assets and goodwill. Impairment provisions for the temporary staffing operations primarily included adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill. Financial Position and Liquidity Cash used in operating activities in 2003 was primarily due to the significant use of cash to fund project operations. This compares to substantial cash provided by operating activities in 2002 and 2001. Significant cash was used in 2003 and 2002 to fund projects in the Power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of $212.8 million and $282.1 million, respectively. These advances represent the companys proportional share of excess cash from Duke/ Fluor Daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in 2001 and prior years upon award of projects. The joint venture partners manage excess cash of Duke/ Fluor Daniel through these proportional advances. Client advances on Duke/ Fluor Daniel projects is a normal condition of contracts in the power industry where most of the projects are negotiated on a fixed price basis. As these projects progress, the expenditures for labor and materials is partially funded from these advance payments. A substantial number of projects were completed in 2003 and 2002 and the advances used to fund these completed projects were not replaced with new advances due to the significant reduction in new awards in the Power segment. The work off of projects in progress and the significant reduction in new power industry awards experienced in 2003 and 2002 is expected to continue in the near term future and will further reduce total advances available to the company. The company also used significant cash in 2003 to fund on going work and the change orders that are in the dispute resolution process relating to the Hamaca project in Venezuela. The company is incurring substantial costs relating to the change orders for which it is not currently being paid pending resolution through arbitration. As of December 31, 2003, the company has $179.6 million in deferred costs on this project, of which $124.6 million was funded during 2003. On going work on Hamaca not associated with change orders used approximately $80 million of cash from advances received in prior years. Excluding the impact of the repayment of advances relating to power projects and the funding for the Hamaca project, cash 25 Table of Contents was used to fund other changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily associated with engineering and construction activities. Approximately $44 million of working capital was provided to P2S which was acquired early in 2003. There was also a significant increase in operating assets and liabilities totaling approximately $126 million relating to work in the Government segment primarily in connection with start up activities on the CETAC and AFCAP projects in the Middle East as well as the Missile Defense work in Alaska. The projects in the Middle East required rapid deployment late in the fourth quarter of 2003 which resulted in substantial initial investment of working capital. In addition, early start up activities and on going progress on major Oil & Gas projects have also required investments in operating working capital. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. Cash used by operating activities is also impacted by contributions to the companys defined benefit retirement plans. Contributions in 2003 amounted to $52 million compared with $110 million and $68 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The large contributions in 2002 and 2001 were due in part to lower than expected investment results on plan assets experienced in those and the two prior years coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain full funding of accumulated benefits in most of its plans. One plan is not fully funded and in 2003 the minimum pension liability amounts to $28 million for this plan. The company recognized a minimum liability plus elimination of $12 million of prepaid pension assets in 2002 resulting in an after tax charge of $29 million in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of Shareholders Equity. During 2003 and 2002, the receipt of funds from insurance claims relating to the Murrin Murrin project amounted to $84.1 million and $35.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, amounts due from the insurance companies for claims submitted have been collected except for minor amounts of arbitration defense costs that are still in the payment process. Activities in 2002 associated with the disposal of certain discontinued equipment and temporary staffing businesses generated $24 million of cash from liquidation of operating assets and liabilities, primarily from accounts receivable and inventories. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2003 included capital expenditures of $79.2 million for continuing operations and $54.5 million for the acquisition of Del Jen, P2S and J.A. Jones International which were partially offset by $31.9 million in proceeds from the sale of the last discontinued equipment dealership operation. Cash provided by investing activities in 2002 was benefited by the sale and liquidation activities associated with discontinued operations. Sales of discontinued businesses generated $101 million in proceeds from the liquidation of property, plant and equipment and sales of dealership and temporary staffing businesses. Partially offsetting these proceeds was capital expenditures of $16 million primarily for the one remaining equipment dealership that was sold in 2003. Capital expenditures for continuing operations primarily relate to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. Capital expenditures were substantially lower in 2002 than in 2001 primarily as the result of substantial completion in 2001 of the SAP system component of the companys Enterprise Resource Management system. Capital expenditures in 2001 include expenditures for capital investments in construction equipment of $60 million for continuing operations and $52 million for discontinued operations. The decision to divest certain equipment operations substantially reduces the companys capital investment requirements. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, facility renewal and refurbishment, and computer infrastructure in support of the companys substantial investment in automated systems. As of December 31, 2003, primarily in response to a significant increase in funds required for project operations, the company borrowed $121.5 million in the commercial paper market. The company can borrow up to $300 million under unsecured committed revolving short and long term lines of credit with banks. These credit lines provide support for borrowings in the commercial paper market as needed for short term liquidity to meet funding requirements for project operations. Liquidity is further provided by substantial customer advances on contracts in progress including the companys proportional share of excess cash that has been advanced to the company by Duke/ Fluor Daniel as well as the commercial paper borrowings. As customer advances and advances from Duke/ Fluor Daniel are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. Cash is also required and is being 26 Table of Contents provided to fund work performed on the Hamaca project in Venezuela. This project is incurring significant costs for work relating to change orders that are subject to arbitration proceedings. The requirements for operating liquidity could result in the need for additional short term borrowings. As of December 31, 2003, the companys outstanding debt consists of the above mentioned commercial paper and the 5.625 percent Municipal bonds totaling $17.6 million. In addition, the company has debt associated with the lease financing on its facilities in Aliso Viejo and Calgary, as discussed above. The lease financing on the Aliso Viejo facility is due in December 2004 and is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2003. In February 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes due 2024. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off all outstanding commercial paper and obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains amounting to $45.1 million and $20.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. The company has a common stock buyback program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. During 2003, the company purchased 94,000 shares for total consideration of $2.7 million. The company purchased 726,000 and 39,000 shares of its common stock for total consideration of $19.2 million and $1.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash dividends declared and paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were at the rate of $0.64 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand and short and long term lines of credit give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $731 million in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. In addition, the company has $120 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2003, the company had utilized $355 million of its letter of credit capacity. The company also posts surety bonds primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. 27 Table of Contents Contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 are summarized as follows: Payments Due By Period Total Under 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 Years $ in millions Long term Debt: 5.625% Municipal Bonds $ 18 $ $ $ $ 18 Facilities financing(1) 127 100 27 Operating leases(2) 271 31 49 32 159 Compensation related obligations 271 31 65 83 92 Pollution control bonds 10 2 5 3 Total $ 697 $ 164 $ 146 $ 118 $ 269 (1) Facilities in Aliso Viejo and Calgary are financed under capital leases and contain residual value guarantees totaling $105 million. (2) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas. Guarantees. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2003. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the amount payable under a guarantee is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2003, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $8 million. The remaining outstanding amount of a financial guarantee for $10 million of pollution control bonds related to zinc operations that were sold in 1987 has been recognized at the full amount of the underlying obligation. The obligation was recognized by a charge to earnings in 2002 due to the obligors bankruptcy filing and inability to meet the current obligation on the bonds without financial assistance from the company. Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix costs at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon on the $17.6 million in long term debt. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or 28 Table of Contents its debt instruments. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on its long term debt is not material. The company utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2003, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than eighteen months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2003 was $53 million. In 2001, the company issued a warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares, at $36.06 per share, of the companys common stock to a partner in the companys e commerce procurement venture. Any compensation realized by the holder through exercise of the warrant will offset royalties otherwise payable under a five year cooperation and services agreement. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non operating income and expense items; earnings or loss from discontinued operations; and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The company reports financial results on a calendar year basis for all periods subsequent to December 31, 2000. Accounting Pronouncements Following is a discussion of the impact of recent accounting and financial reporting pronouncements that have been applied in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. This information is provided to assist in an understanding of the impact such changes have had on the companys financial reporting. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Under SFAS 144, a component of a business that is held for sale is reported in discontinued operations if (i) the operations and cash flows will be, or have been, eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and, (ii) the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in such operations. In the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2001. In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was completed in 2003 with the disposition of the last remaining operation in the construction equipment business. The operating results for discontinued operations are discussed later in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These statements were effective for the companys calendar year 2002. Under the new rules, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. During 2003, the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and has determined that none of the goodwill is impaired. Application of the non amortization provisions resulted in an increase in earnings from continuing operations of $3.4 million ($0.04 per diluted share) in 2002 and 2003 compared with 2001. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The Statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Application of this statement did not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in 2003. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 expands on the accounting and disclosure requirements under existing accounting standards. It clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation. Disclosures required by the Interpretation are provided below in the Financial Position and Liquidity section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. The accounting requirements of the Interpretation are applicable to transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2003. Application of this Interpretation did not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in 2003. 14 Table of Contents In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R). FIN 46 R provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Certain of the companys engineering office facilities are leased through arrangements involving variable interest entities. Beginning in 2003, the company now consolidates these entities in its financial statements as prescribed by FIN 46 R. At December 31, 2003, the effect of this consolidation resulted in an increase of $100 million and $27 million in reported short term and long term debt, respectively, and an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment of $107 million. None of the terms of the leasing arrangements or the companys obligations as a lessee were impacted by this change in accounting. The cumulative impact of the difference in earnings, amounting to a charge of $10.4 million net of tax, relating to prior years was reported in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The company may also use variable interest entities from time to time to facilitate financing of various projects. There are no such financing entities in use at the present time. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards. In April 2003 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 149, Amendments of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 149). SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 149 did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. On May 15, 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150). SFAS 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. SFAS 150 did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts. Engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total 15 Table of Contents estimated contract costs. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor costs and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, or achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract costs and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 60 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while approximately 40 percent was for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues realized from the project. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made certain claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and costs, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures. Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues, costs and operating profits in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet. The most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the Power segment. This segment includes Duke/ Fluor Daniel and ICA Fluor Daniel. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles. Foreign Currency. The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in 16 Table of Contents exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the company did not have any significant forward exchange contracts. The company does not engage in currency speculation. In connection with the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project located in Jose, Venezuela, the company has incurred foreign currency exposures and related translation losses due to weakness in the Venezuelan Bolivar compared with the U.S. dollar. See additional discussion concerning the Hamaca project below under Results of Operations Oil & Gas. Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2003 the company had deferred tax assets of $288.8 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $63.7 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $40.5 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards, net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain project performance reserves. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Retirement Benefits. The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Recent decreases in long term interest rates have the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund approximately $30 to $50 million for the calendar year 2004. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $25 million. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Revenue declined 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to declines in the Power and Oil & Gas segments. Earnings from continuing operations increased 4.7 percent to $2.23 per share in 2003 compared with $2.13 per share in 2002. The increase in earnings is primarily attributable to reduced corporate administrative and general expense and a lower tax rate on earnings from continuing operations. Lower segment operating profit, primarily in the Power segment, and lower net interest income partially offset these improvements. The company has experienced a significant decline in Power segment revenue and earnings as most projects in the segment were completed and not replaced by new awards. The decline in new awards in the Power segment over the last two years reflects a cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction. Partially offsetting this trend in Power is an increasing trend for new awards in the Oil & Gas and Government segments. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in the early stages of a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next three to five years. In addition, the trend for new awards in the Government segment have increased due to awards for work in Iraq as well as the completion of two niche acquisitions that improves the companys service offering to both the Department of Defense and Department of State. Revenue increased 11 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to an increase in the Oil & Gas segment. Earnings from continuing operations increased 32 percent to $2.13 per share in 2002 compared with 17 Table of Contents $1.61 per share in 2001. This increase is partially due to a net $15.2 million ($0.19 per share) charge for stock price driven compensation plan expense in 2001 due to the increase in stock price primarily in the first quarter of the year. Excluding the stock price charge, the increase in earnings from continuing operations in 2002 compared with 2001 was 18.9 percent. This increase is primarily due to significantly improved operating profit performance in the Power segment as earnings were recognized on completed projects that were awarded in prior years. The company had net earnings of $1.95 per share in 2003 compared with $2.05 in 2002 and $0.25 in 2001. Results in 2003 were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of $0.15 per share and a loss of $0.13 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results in 2002 and 2001 include losses from discontinued operations of $0.08 per share and $1.36 per share, respectively. The results of discontinued operations is further discussed below. The loss from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is discussed above under Accounting Pronouncements. Following is a discussion of the operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items. The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance. During the first quarter of 2003, the company realigned certain operations to increase focus on the chemicals market. Projects in this market were formerly in the Energy & Chemicals segment and will now be executed and reported in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment. The Energy & Chemicals segment was renamed Oil & Gas and all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. The company is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil & Gas segment provides engineering and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides engineering and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities, commercial and institutional buildings, mining, chemicals, telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities. The Government segment provides project management engineering, construction, and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, construction equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services. The Power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities. Services provided by the Power segment are conducted through two joint ventures; Duke/ Fluor Daniel, a 50 percent owned partnership with Duke Energy, and ICA Fluor Daniel, a 49 percent owned joint venture with Grupo ICA, a Mexican company. The results of segment operations as reported herein have been conformed to the organizational alignment discussed above for all periods presented. Oil & Gas. Revenue in the Oil & Gas segment amounted to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 representing a decrease of 24 percent over revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenue for the 2002 period increased 54 percent compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in revenue during 2003 reflects the completion of several projects during the year and revenue recognition from projects awarded in 2003 did not fully replace the revenue on the completed projects. The revenue increase in 2002 compared with 2001 reflects the increase in work performed on projects in the full execution stage compared with revenue primarily from front end studies and preliminary engineering in the 2001 period. Operating profit margin in the Oil & Gas segment increased in 2003 to 4.6 percent compared with 3.7 percent in 2002 due to the higher content of project completions combined with improved execution performance. Operating profit margin in 2002 was lower than the 4.5 percent that was achieved in 2001 due to the impact of projects moving to full execution from the higher margin front end studies and preliminary engineering work performed in 2001. A major ongoing project in the Oil & Gas segment in 2003 is the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project (Hamaca) located in Jose, Venezuela. Hamaca is a $1.1 billion lump sum project (including $92 million of approved change orders) of Grupo Alvica (GA), a joint venture including Fluor Daniel (80 percent) and Inelectra C.A. (20 percent), to design and build a petroleum upgrader for a consortium of owners called Petrolera Ameriven (PA) including Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips. 18 Table of Contents The joint venture is actively pursuing two cost and schedule relief issues that were referred to arbitration in December 2001: the first is responsibility for costs arising from the site labor agreement for 2000 called Acta Convenio and the second relates to modifications and extra work arising from differing site soil conditions. The hearings on the fundamental cost differences between the earlier 1998 labor agreement and the 2000 Acta Convenio were held in April 2003. The site soil conditions issue was the subject of hearings in November 2002. There are no monetary cross claims by PA in the arbitration. Events in Venezuela including a national strike in early 2003 have had a significant impact on the progress of the project. In accordance with the contract, the joint venture is entitled to cost and schedule relief for the impact of the national strike. A change order relating to the national strike in the approximate amount of $340 million was submitted by GA. This action was followed by the filing of an arbitration claim relating to this issue in January 2004. A time schedule for the resolution of the claim will be established by the arbitration panel in the near future. Force majeure incidents occurring prior to the national strike also were the subject of arbitration hearings in October 2003. The arbitration panel, by procedural order dated January 8, 2004, has ordered PA to refrain from taking any action to seek liquidated delay damages, making claim against or drawing down on a Letter of Credit, terminating the contract with GA, or making any demands pursuant to any guarantee provisions in the contract, pending completion of the site soil conditions issues. The award on the site soils conditions matter is anticipated in the near future. The client has conditionally accepted responsibility relating to the soil conditions and $28 million of incurred costs has been paid. The amount of the claim for site soil conditions is $159 million including the $28 million conditional payment. The company is accounting for the additional costs incurred for the soil conditions matter as additional revenue as payments are received. The amount of the claim for Acta Convenio is $210 million and no payments have been made by the client relating to this matter. Incurred costs associated with Acta Convenio, soil conditions, the recent national strike and other claims are probable of being recovered and thus are being deferred. These costs will be recognized in revenue when a change order is approved or payment is received. As of December 31, 2003, incurred costs amounting to $179.6 million have been deferred. Substantial additional costs are expected to be incurred as the project progresses and resolution of outstanding issues concerning the total amount to be awarded and schedule extensions are yet to be determined. If costs relating to Acta Convenio, soil conditions, the recent national strike or other claims are determined to be not recoverable, the company could face reduced profits or losses on this project, along with lower levels of cash and additional borrowings. The project remains subject to future disruptions that could result in additional costs and claims. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $3.7 billion in 2003 compared to $1.9 billion in 2002. New project awards in 2003 include the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project, a major oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. The TCO project was expected to be awarded in 2002 but was temporarily suspended due to funding considerations, which were resolved early in 2003. Also included in new awards in 2003 is the Sakhalin I program and construction management project led by ExxonMobil and a project for Lukoil, a major Russian oil company. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $1.9 billion in 2002, a decline of 13 percent over 2001. The 2002 decline was primarily due to the previously mentioned temporary suspension of the TCO project. The large size and uncertain timing of complex, international projects can create variability in the segments award pattern; consequently, future award trends are difficult to predict with certainty. Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment increased to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002. This increase is due to the higher level of new awards in 2003 and the lower level of work performed on these new awards as they are in the early stages of project execution where activity is focused on engineering and project planning. Backlog declined to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $3.7 billion at December 31, 2001. The 2002 decline in backlog primarily is the result of the temporary suspension in 2002 of the TCO project that was awarded in early 2003 as discussed above. Industrial & Infrastructure. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment had revenues of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an 8 percent increase compared with the previous year. This increase primarily reflects the higher volume of work performed on life sciences projects awarded in 2002 partially offset by lower volume of work performed on mining projects as a number of projects were completed in 2002 19 Table of Contents and not replaced with new awards. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment had revenues of $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 essentially flat with the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001. Operating profit for the segment was impacted in both 2003 and 2002 by provisions relating to projects awarded in previous years. In 2003 operating profit was negatively impacted by a pre tax provision of $7.4 million relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in Australia. The investment was committed in previous years as part of a consulting arrangement with the client where the company agreed to be compensated for its services in shares of the clients capital stock. Due to funding considerations, continued development of the project was suspended resulting in the client seeking bankruptcy protection. Because the company was not the execution contractor there was no impact on backlog or operating results from project execution. A pre tax $26 million dispute resolution provision in 2002 primarily relates to an unfavorable arbitration ruling on the Verde Gold project in Chile, a gold ore processing facility completed in 1996. During the second quarter of 2002, the company recognized a loss provision of $20 million representing the arbitration award plus applicable interest, less a $3 million reserve provided in prior years. The company anticipates recovering a portion of the award from available insurance and has recorded $6 million in expected insurance recoveries. The net impact on results of operations for 2002 was a charge of $14 million. The 2003 operating profit margin in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment was essentially flat with 2002. These results are substantially below results achieved in 2001 primarily due to the provisions discussed above. In 2003 margins were also lower due to the increased volume of construction management work and lack of project margin on projects that were removed from backlog which are discussed below. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $2.6 billion compared with $3.5 billion in 2002. New awards in 2002 included a substantial award for the SH 130 toll road project in Texas. In addition, new awards in 2003 were lower than 2002 and 2001 due to continuing economic weakness in the mining, telecommunications and manufacturing markets reflecting overcapacity and poor commodity pricing in these industries. Backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment declined to $3.3 billion compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2002. Contributing to this decline was the removal of $750 million for three projects that had been booked during the previous two years. One of these was a mining project that was removed due to considerations relating to ongoing financing. The other two were commercial projects that the company decided to not execute due to evolving changes in industry liability. The increase in backlog to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2002 compared with $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2001 reflects the strong increase particularly in life sciences and transportation awards in 2002. Government. The Government segment had revenues of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with revenue of $1.0 billion in 2002. This 78 percent increase is primarily due to the substantial increase in work performed for the Department of Defense on the Midcourse Missile Defense test bed facilities in Alaska, the Department of State for an embassy project in Brazil and new awards for task orders in Iraq. Also contributing to the increase was revenue from Del Jen which was acquired early in 2003. Government segment revenue in 2002 increased 17 percent over revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001. The revenue increase in 2002 primarily reflects higher activity levels on projects being executed for the Department of Energy (DOE). Revenue in all periods includes work for ongoing environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project in Ohio and the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. Operating profit margin for the Government segment declined to 2.8 percent in 2003 compared with 3.1 percent in 2002. Contributing to this decline was the impact of a particularly high level of proposal activity during the year as the segment pursued a number of new opportunities. The operating profit margin of 3.1 percent in 2002 compares with 2.7 percent in 2001. This improvement is attributable to improved project execution and realization of performance incentives on the DOE contracts, activity on the Midcourse Missile Defense test bed facilities in Alaska and increased logistical support activities internationally. In addition, good performance on the Fernald contract led to a re baselining of the project, which favorably impacted operating profit in 2003 and the last half of 2002. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government 20 Table of Contents clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months. In January 2003, the company acquired Del Jen, Inc. (Del Jen), a leading provider of services to the Departments of Defense and Labor. The acquisition will expand the companys ability to provide services in the government outsourcing market. Del Jen was acquired for $33.3 million in cash of which $24 million was recognized as goodwill and $3.2 million was recognized as intangible assets. In November 2003, the company acquired the International Division of J.A. Jones Construction Company (J.A. Jones), which provides design build and construction services to the U.S. Government. This acquisition will further expand the companys portfolio of government business. The acquisition did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. Total assets in the Government segment increased to $475 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $128 million at December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Del Jen with total assets of $60.4 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the segment has unbilled fees totaling $39.3 million related to the Fernald project. The project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in 2007. Deferred fees recognized in revenue in 2003 and 2002 were $21.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in segment assets was a significant increase in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to work performed in the Middle East. Global Services. The Global Services segment had revenues of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, up 15 percent compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Revenue for 2002 was 6 percent lower than revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in revenue in 2003 is partially due to the acquisition of Plant Performance Services (P2S) at the end of the first quarter. The revenue decline in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflects the impact of increased selectivity to improve margins and depressed economic conditions resulting in lower operations and maintenance activity in the manufacturing sector. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 8.7 percent compared with 9.7 percent in 2002 and 4.9 percent in 2001. The reduced margin in 2003 is partially attributable to lower contribution from P2S and construction related services reflecting the lower volume in Power and Oil & Gas activities. The improvement in 2002 compared with the prior period is primarily attributable to the procurement services business which incurred substantial amounts of development and start up expenses in 2001. In March 2003, the company acquired five specialty operations and maintenance (O&M) business groups from Philip Services Corporation. The acquired businesses, which were named Plant Performance Services (P2S), will expand and strengthen the O&M services business component of the Global Services segment and complement the companys core engineering, procurement and construction business. The business groups were acquired for $21.2 million in cash which excluded working capital. During the period from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2003, approximately $44 million of working capital has been provided to the business to fund operations. As of December 31, 2003, the allocation of the purchase price has not been finalized pending valuation of assets acquired through independent appraisals. New awards in the Global Services segment for operations and maintenance projects were $1.3 billion, an increase of 23 percent over 2002. This increase is primarily due to the contribution from P2S. The 17 percent decline in new awards in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily attributable to increased selectivity and the depressed economic conditions in the manufacturing sector. Backlog for the Global Services segment has been fairly stable at $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This relative stability is due in part to the multi year nature of operations and maintenance contracts where consistent and efficient performance results in long term client relationships. The equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. 21 Table of Contents Power. The Power segment experienced a significant decline in revenue to $759 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $2.2 billion in 2002 and $2.5 billion in 2001. This decline is due to the substantial work off of nearly all projects in backlog that were awarded in prior years. As mentioned previously, the segment has experienced a substantial reduction in new awards over the last two years as demand for new power generation has diminished following a strong cycle of power plant construction activity. Operating profit margin in the Power segment was a very strong 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with 4.9 percent in 2002 and 3.0 percent in 2001. The strong performance in 2003 is attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of projects. Projects in the Power segment are primarily bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. On July 9, 2003, the company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation the decision to terminate the Duke/ Fluor Daniel partnership (D/ FD) as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. A joint plan among the partners is being developed to dissolve the business over the next two years. The dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position of the company. The company will continue to identify power generation opportunities and any prospective projects will be performed 100 percent by Fluor. New awards in the Power segment were down substantially to $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $1.1 billion and $3.6 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The majority of new awards in 2003 will be executed by Fluor or ICA/ Fluor Daniel. Backlog for the Power segment decreased to $605 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $841 million and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Most of the projects awarded in prior years have now been completed or will be completed in 2004. New award activity for the near term future is expected to be modest as existing capacity is expected to meet anticipated demand. Corporate. Corporate administrative and general expenses totaled $141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This compares with $160.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $167.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The improvement in 2003 compared with 2002 is primarily due to the absence of charges relating to the reevaluation of the companys enterprise resource management (ERM) system, recognition of a provision for a guarantee obligation and a provision to recognize impairment related to an investment in The Beacon Group Energy Investment Fund, L.P. that were recognized in 2002. Partially offsetting these charges in 2002 was recognition of a gain relating to the demutualization of an insurance company in which the company had an investment. During 2002 significant cost reductions were realized as a result of the companys reevaluation of the scope of implementation and deployment of its ERM system (formerly known as Knowledge@Work). As part of this reevaluation effort the company altered the original ERM implementation plan and recognized a charge of $13.0 million in 2002 for abandonment of certain system functionality and to adjust depreciation expense. This charge partially offset the impact of the cost reductions realized upon changing the implementation and deployment plan. Stock based compensation expense in 2002 was $25.3 million lower compared with 2001 primarily as a result of a significant increase in the trading price of the companys common stock during the first half of 2001. The impact of changes in the stock price in 2003 and 2002 did not have a significant impact on stock based compensation expense as exercises, retirements and conversions have reduced the number of stock price sensitive units outstanding. During 2002 overhead cost reductions were realized as a result of the early retirement of two former senior executives at the end of 2001 and the elimination of the Business Services and Other segment. This segment included the companys shared services operations. Shared services are grouped in corporate administrative and general expense for all periods presented. Net interest income was $3.2 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, compared with net interest expense of $0.9 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The reduction in net interest income in 2003 is the result of lower cash balances and increased short term borrowings 22 Table of Contents compared with 2002. The increase in net interest income in 2002 compared with 2001 is primarily due to the elimination of short term borrowings. The effective tax rates on the companys continuing operations were 33.0 percent, 34.8 percent and 31.1 percent, for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the tax rate in 2003 compared with 2002 is primarily due to the utilization of certain capital loss carryforwards coupled with reduced foreign losses without tax benefit. In addition, during 2003 the company had favorable tax return adjustments and settlements which were partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance to adjust net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The tax rate in 2001 compared with 2002 was lower due to the tax benefits from tax settlements and the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Matters in Dispute Resolution. During 2003, several matters on certain completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of these matters: Murrin Murrin Disputes between Fluor Australia (Fluor) and its client, Anaconda Nickel (Anaconda), over the Murrin Murrin Nickel Cobalt project located in Western Australia were partially resolved through arbitration during the third quarter of 2002. The first phase of the arbitration hearing was completed in May 2002 and a decision was rendered in September 2002 resulting in an award to Anaconda of A$147 million (subsequently amended to A$150 million [US$84.0 million]) and an award to Fluor of A$107 million [US$59.9 million] for amounts owing from Anaconda under the contract. The company has recovered the first phase award plus substantially all defense costs incurred from available insurance. On July 28, 2003, the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia granted Anacondas appeal of an issue that had been decided in favor of Fluor by the arbitration panel in the first phase. This decision sends the arbitration panels denial of Anacondas claim for the cost of a fifth autoclave train back to the panel for further reconsideration. Fluor has appealed the Supreme Courts decision to the State of Victoria Court of Appeal. The second phase of the arbitration was heard in September 2003. A decision is expected in the third quarter of 2004. The company anticipates that any liability arising from proceedings under either the first or the second phase of arbitration, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, will be covered by available insurance. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. V. General Electric Company, et al U.S.D.C., Southern District Court, New York In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2004. Dearborn Industrial Project Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan. The initial Turnkey Agreement, dated November 24, 1998, consisted of three phases. Commencing shortly after Notice to Proceed, the owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. The Project has been severely delayed with completion of Phase II. DIG has unilaterally taken over completion and operation of Phase II and is commissioning that portion of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit which D/ FD expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute. D/ FD 23 Table of Contents retains lien rights (in fee) against the project. In October 2001, suit was commenced in Michigan State Court to foreclose on the lien interest. In December 2001, DIG filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to D/ FD claiming, among other things, that D/ FD is liable to DIG for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the Dearborn plant. The court has ordered the matter to arbitration. The lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of D/ FDs claims against DIG and DIGs claims against D/ FD. An arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration will likely proceed in early 2005. Butinge Nafta Oil Terminal On March 10, 2000, Butinge Nafta (Nafta) commenced arbitration proceedings against Fluor Daniel Intercontinental (FDI) concerning a bulk oil storage terminal (the Facility) located in Lithuania alleging, among other issues, that FDI represented costs in excess of actual estimates. FDI engineered, procured and managed the construction of the Facility on a lump sum basis. On June 21, 2000, Fluor filed a separate arbitration against Nafta to recover delay/disruption damages caused by Nafta, as well as compensation for out of scope services. The first hearing on the merits of the case was conducted in late May 2001 with an additional hearing in June 2002. Final legal submissions and arguments were completed in September 2002. In June 2003, FDI was issued a favorable award on its claims and Naftas major claims against FDI were dismissed with prejudice resulting in a net award to Fluor of $4.6 million. The resolution of this matter did not have a material effect on results of operations. Hamaca Crude Upgrader See discussion regarding the Hamaca project above under Oil & Gas. Strategic Reorganization Costs. In March 1999, the company reorganized its engineering and construction operations and recorded a special provision to cover direct and other reorganization related costs primarily for personnel, facilities and asset impairment adjustments. The plan was successfully implemented and carried out. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining unexpended reserve is $1.5 million and relates to non U.S. personnel costs that will be paid as follows: 2004 $0.8 million; 2005 $0.3 million; 2006 $0.2 million; 2007 $0.1 million; thereafter $0.1 million. Discontinued Operations. In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and non EPC components of its temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and is complete as of the end of 2003. Operating results for these non core businesses have been reclassified and are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During 2003 the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of $31.9 million. In 2002, the sale of one dealership subsidiary resulted in cash proceeds of $45.9 million. Other dealership asset disposals during 2002 produced proceeds of $51 million. In December 2001, the company sold one dealership entity for cash equal to its carrying value generating proceeds of $25.7 million. During the second quarter of 2002, the Australian operations of the temporary staffing operations of TRS were sold, resulting in cash proceeds of $5.1 million. The temporary staffing industry experienced severe competition in 2002 due to depressed economic conditions, which resulted in significant erosion in the fair value of the TRS businesses that were sold. As a result, the company recognized adjustments to the carrying value of TRSs U.S. and U.K. based disposal groups. The sales of the U.S. and U.K. operations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 resulting in proceeds of $2 million. Disposal of AMECO operations in Argentina and Peru were finalized in 2002 resulting in proceeds of $5.1 million primarily from collection of accounts receivable and sales of inventory and equipment. Interest expense was not reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with the non core businesses because disposal of these operations did not include any debt to be assumed by the buyers. 24 Table of Contents Revenue and the results of operations, including loss on disposal, for all discontinued operations are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands) Revenue Dealership operations $ 30,097 $ 155,909 $ 279,099 Other equipment operations 7,880 10,153 Temporary staffing operations 34 67,661 138,102 Total Revenue $ 30,131 $ 231,450 $ 427,354 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations: Dealership operations $ 2,575 $ 4,214 $ 13,569 Other equipment operations 117 213 (1,787 ) Temporary staffing operations (404 ) (4,036 ) (9,898 ) Earnings from discontinued operations before tax 2,288 391 1,884 Provision for taxes 800 891 1,632 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,488 $ (500 ) $ 252 Loss on disposal before tax $ (7,386 ) $ (8,770 ) $ (139,423 ) Provision for taxes (tax benefit) 5,718 (2,909 ) (30,815 ) Loss on disposal $ (13,104 ) $ (5,861 ) $ (108,608 ) The loss on disposal in all periods presented above is for impairment provisions to adjust the carrying value of the assets held for sale of the various individual non core businesses to fair value. Impairment provisions for the equipment operations included adjustments to the carrying value of equipment inventories, fixed assets and goodwill. Impairment provisions for the temporary staffing operations primarily included adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill. Financial Position and Liquidity Cash used in operating activities in 2003 was primarily due to the significant use of cash to fund project operations. This compares to substantial cash provided by operating activities in 2002 and 2001. Significant cash was used in 2003 and 2002 to fund projects in the Power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of $212.8 million and $282.1 million, respectively. These advances represent the companys proportional share of excess cash from Duke/ Fluor Daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in 2001 and prior years upon award of projects. The joint venture partners manage excess cash of Duke/ Fluor Daniel through these proportional advances. Client advances on Duke/ Fluor Daniel projects is a normal condition of contracts in the power industry where most of the projects are negotiated on a fixed price basis. As these projects progress, the expenditures for labor and materials is partially funded from these advance payments. A substantial number of projects were completed in 2003 and 2002 and the advances used to fund these completed projects were not replaced with new advances due to the significant reduction in new awards in the Power segment. The work off of projects in progress and the significant reduction in new power industry awards experienced in 2003 and 2002 is expected to continue in the near term future and will further reduce total advances available to the company. The company also used significant cash in 2003 to fund on going work and the change orders that are in the dispute resolution process relating to the Hamaca project in Venezuela. The company is incurring substantial costs relating to the change orders for which it is not currently being paid pending resolution through arbitration. As of December 31, 2003, the company has $179.6 million in deferred costs on this project, of which $124.6 million was funded during 2003. On going work on Hamaca not associated with change orders used approximately $80 million of cash from advances received in prior years. Excluding the impact of the repayment of advances relating to power projects and the funding for the Hamaca project, cash 25 Table of Contents was used to fund other changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily associated with engineering and construction activities. Approximately $44 million of working capital was provided to P2S which was acquired early in 2003. There was also a significant increase in operating assets and liabilities totaling approximately $126 million relating to work in the Government segment primarily in connection with start up activities on the CETAC and AFCAP projects in the Middle East as well as the Missile Defense work in Alaska. The projects in the Middle East required rapid deployment late in the fourth quarter of 2003 which resulted in substantial initial investment of working capital. In addition, early start up activities and on going progress on major Oil & Gas projects have also required investments in operating working capital. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. Cash used by operating activities is also impacted by contributions to the companys defined benefit retirement plans. Contributions in 2003 amounted to $52 million compared with $110 million and $68 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The large contributions in 2002 and 2001 were due in part to lower than expected investment results on plan assets experienced in those and the two prior years coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain full funding of accumulated benefits in most of its plans. One plan is not fully funded and in 2003 the minimum pension liability amounts to $28 million for this plan. The company recognized a minimum liability plus elimination of $12 million of prepaid pension assets in 2002 resulting in an after tax charge of $29 million in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of Shareholders Equity. During 2003 and 2002, the receipt of funds from insurance claims relating to the Murrin Murrin project amounted to $84.1 million and $35.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, amounts due from the insurance companies for claims submitted have been collected except for minor amounts of arbitration defense costs that are still in the payment process. Activities in 2002 associated with the disposal of certain discontinued equipment and temporary staffing businesses generated $24 million of cash from liquidation of operating assets and liabilities, primarily from accounts receivable and inventories. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2003 included capital expenditures of $79.2 million for continuing operations and $54.5 million for the acquisition of Del Jen, P2S and J.A. Jones International which were partially offset by $31.9 million in proceeds from the sale of the last discontinued equipment dealership operation. Cash provided by investing activities in 2002 was benefited by the sale and liquidation activities associated with discontinued operations. Sales of discontinued businesses generated $101 million in proceeds from the liquidation of property, plant and equipment and sales of dealership and temporary staffing businesses. Partially offsetting these proceeds was capital expenditures of $16 million primarily for the one remaining equipment dealership that was sold in 2003. Capital expenditures for continuing operations primarily relate to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. Capital expenditures were substantially lower in 2002 than in 2001 primarily as the result of substantial completion in 2001 of the SAP system component of the companys Enterprise Resource Management system. Capital expenditures in 2001 include expenditures for capital investments in construction equipment of $60 million for continuing operations and $52 million for discontinued operations. The decision to divest certain equipment operations substantially reduces the companys capital investment requirements. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, facility renewal and refurbishment, and computer infrastructure in support of the companys substantial investment in automated systems. As of December 31, 2003, primarily in response to a significant increase in funds required for project operations, the company borrowed $121.5 million in the commercial paper market. The company can borrow up to $300 million under unsecured committed revolving short and long term lines of credit with banks. These credit lines provide support for borrowings in the commercial paper market as needed for short term liquidity to meet funding requirements for project operations. Liquidity is further provided by substantial customer advances on contracts in progress including the companys proportional share of excess cash that has been advanced to the company by Duke/ Fluor Daniel as well as the commercial paper borrowings. As customer advances and advances from Duke/ Fluor Daniel are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. Cash is also required and is being 26 Table of Contents provided to fund work performed on the Hamaca project in Venezuela. This project is incurring significant costs for work relating to change orders that are subject to arbitration proceedings. The requirements for operating liquidity could result in the need for additional short term borrowings. As of December 31, 2003, the companys outstanding debt consists of the above mentioned commercial paper and the 5.625 percent Municipal bonds totaling $17.6 million. In addition, the company has debt associated with the lease financing on its facilities in Aliso Viejo and Calgary, as discussed above. The lease financing on the Aliso Viejo facility is due in December 2004 and is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2003. In February 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes due 2024. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off all outstanding commercial paper and obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains amounting to $45.1 million and $20.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. The company has a common stock buyback program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. During 2003, the company purchased 94,000 shares for total consideration of $2.7 million. The company purchased 726,000 and 39,000 shares of its common stock for total consideration of $19.2 million and $1.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash dividends declared and paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were at the rate of $0.64 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand and short and long term lines of credit give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $731 million in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. In addition, the company has $120 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2003, the company had utilized $355 million of its letter of credit capacity. The company also posts surety bonds primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. 27 Table of Contents Contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 are summarized as follows: Payments Due By Period Total Under 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 Years $ in millions Long term Debt: 5.625% Municipal Bonds $ 18 $ $ $ $ 18 Facilities financing(1) 127 100 27 Operating leases(2) 271 31 49 32 159 Compensation related obligations 271 31 65 83 92 Pollution control bonds 10 2 5 3 Total $ 697 $ 164 $ 146 $ 118 $ 269 (1) Facilities in Aliso Viejo and Calgary are financed under capital leases and contain residual value guarantees totaling $105 million. (2) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas. Guarantees. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2003. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the amount payable under a guarantee is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract.
