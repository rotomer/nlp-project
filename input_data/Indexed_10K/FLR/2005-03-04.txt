In November 2000, a spin off distribution to shareholders was effected which separated then existing Fluor Corporation into two publicly traded companies new Fluor (Fluor or the company) and Massey Energy Company (Massey). Masseys results of operations for all periods prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations. In September 2001, the company adopted a plan to dispose of certain non core construction equipment and temporary staffing businesses. The assets and liabilities (including debt) and results of operations of Massey and the non core businesses for all periods presented have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations. In addition, the company changed to a calendar year basis of reporting financial results in connection with the spin off. See Managements Discussion and Analysis on pages 20 to 35 and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages F 9 to F 36 for information relating to significant items affecting the results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non operating income and expense items; earnings or loss from discontinued operations; and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Accounting Pronouncements Following is a discussion of the impact of accounting and financial reporting pronouncements that have been applied in the preparation of the companys Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. This information is provided to assist in an understanding of the impact such changes have had on the companys financial reporting. Unless a specific reference is made to a new pronouncement, the company has determined that the pronouncement either does not apply to its business or that the impact of applying the pronouncement is not significant. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45 or the Interpretation). FIN 45 expands on the accounting and disclosure requirements under existing accounting standards. It clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation. Disclosures required by the Interpretation are provided below in the Financial Position and Liquidity section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. The accounting requirements of the Interpretation are applicable to transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2003. Application of this Interpretation did not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in 2004 or 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R). FIN 46 R provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. The companys engineering office facilities in Aliso Viejo, California (Aliso Viejo) and Calgary, Canada (Calgary) were leased through arrangements involving variable interest entities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, the company consolidated these entities in its financial statements as prescribed by FIN 46 R. At December 31, 2003, the effect of this consolidation resulted in an increase of $100 million and $27 million in reported short term and long term debt, respectively, and an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment of $107 million. None of the terms of the leasing arrangements or the companys obligations as a lessee were impacted by this change in accounting. The cumulative impact of the difference in earnings, amounting to a charge of $10.4 million net of tax, relating to prior years was reported in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. During 2004, the company exercised options to purchase both the Aliso Viejo ($100 million) and Calgary ($29 million) engineering and office facilities. These amounts are reported as repayments of facilities financing in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards. 20 Table of Contents On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2) providing guidance on accounting for the effects of the Act and specific disclosure requirements. Based on an analysis of the Act, the company has concluded that its retiree medical plans provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The company adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2 as of July 1, 2004 and recorded the effects of the subsidy in measuring net periodic postretirement benefit cost during the quarter ended September 30, 2004. This resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits attributed to past service of $2.9 million and a pretax reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit costs of $0.3 million for the second half of the year. In September 2004, the EITF reached a final consensus on Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share (Issue 04 8), that became effective for the company on December 31, 2004. Contingently convertible debt instruments (commonly referred to as Co Cos) are financial instruments that add a contingent feature to a convertible debt instrument. The conversion feature is triggered when one or more specified contingencies occur and at least one of these contingencies is based on market price. Prior to the issuance of the final consensus on Issue No. 04 8 by the EITF, the company applied a widely held interpretation that Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, Earnings per Share, allowed the exclusion of common shares underlying contingently convertible debt instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) in instances where conversion depends on the achievement of a specified market price of the issuers shares and such price had not been attained. Issue 04 8 requires that these underlying common shares be included in the diluted EPS computations, if dilutive, regardless of whether the market price contingency or any other contingent factor has been met. However, principal amounts that must be settled entirely in cash may be excluded from the computations. Prior to the end of 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash, and therefore, there will be no dilutive impact until the average price of the companys stock exceeds the conversion price of $55.94. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the conversion price has been exceeded. If the companys stock price is in excess of the conversion price as of March 31, 2005, the company will then use the treasury stock method of accounting for the excess of the market stock price over $55.94 in calculating diluted EPS. Upon conversion, any stock appreciation amount above the conversion price of $55.94 will be satisfied by the company through the issuance of common stock which thereafter will be included in calculating both basic and diluted EPS. Because the company has irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the debt in cash, previously reported diluted EPS for the first, second, and third quarters of 2004 will not change as a result of the consensus on Issue 04 8. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Upon adoption of SFAS 123 R, pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer permitted. SFAS 123 R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The company expects to adopt SFAS 123 R on January 1, 2005, using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123 R that remain unvested on the effective date. As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to APB 25 and, as such, recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123 Rs fair value method will have an impact on results of operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123 R will not be material based on unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2004. Had SFAS 123 R been adopted in prior periods, the impact would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the Stock Plan footnote under Major Accounting Policies in the 21 Table of Contents accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123 R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This requirement will generally impact cash provided or utilized by operating activities with offsets in cash flows from financing activities in periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $14 million, $4 million, and $2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor costs and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, or achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract costs and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2004, 73 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while 27 percent was for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues realized from the projects. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made certain claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $105 million and $24 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and costs, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues, costs and operating profits in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the Power, Oil Gas and Industrial Infrastructure segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company 22 Table of Contents engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles. Foreign Currency The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. The company does not engage in currency speculation. In connection with the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project located in Jose, Venezuela, the company has incurred foreign currency exposures and related translation losses due to weakness in the Venezuelan Bolivar compared with the U.S. dollar. See additional discussion concerning the Hamaca project below under Results of Operations Oil Gas. Deferred Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2004 the company had deferred tax assets of $272.8 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $57.9 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $55.4 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards, net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain project performance reserves. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Recent decreases in long term interest rates have the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $35 million and $70 million for the calendar year 2005. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $32 million. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results During 2004, revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with 2003. Revenue of the Oil Gas segment was favorably impacted during the year by increased work performed associated with the transition to field activities on two major international projects. Additionally, a positive trend for new awards in the Government segment resulted in a significant increase in work performed in Iraq on projects for the U.S. Government in 2004. The company also benefited from increased revenues beginning in the first quarter of 2004 from business acquisitions completed in 2003 and early 2004. Offsetting these improvements has been a continued trend away from power projects. Revenues and earnings from continuing operations were also negatively impacted by the lower level of new project awards in the economically sensitive mining, chemicals and manufacturing markets experienced in 2003. In addition, the companys 2003 decision to suspend performance on a mining project and withdraw from certain commercial projects had a negative impact on 2003 backlog and the volume of work performed in 2004. Revenue declined 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to declines in the Power and Oil Gas segments. Earnings from continuing operations increased 6 percent primarily due to the improved performance of the Government, Industrial Infrastructure and Global Services Segments. Also contributing to the improvement was lower reported corporate administrative and general expense due to the absence of several non operating charges that were included in 2002, and a lower tax rate on earnings from continuing operations. The company experienced a significant decline in Power segment revenue and earnings over the last two years as projects in the segment were completed and the contribution from new awards declined due to the cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction. Partially offsetting this trend in Power is an increasing trend for new awards in the Industrial Infrastructure and Government segments. Following a low level in 2002, new awards in the Oil Gas segment have rebounded in 2003 and 2004. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in the early stages of a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next three to five years. New awards in the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased significantly in 2004 and were distributed primarily across the mining, chemicals and life sciences markets, reflecting improved economics supporting capital spending commitments. In addition, the trend for new awards in the Government segment has increased due to awards for work in Iraq as well as the completion of the acquisitions of the International Division of J.A. Jones Construction Company (J.A. Jones) and Trend Western Technical Corporation (Trend Western). These acquisitions improve the companys service offering to both the Department of State and Department of Defense. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes for the three years ended December 31, 2004 were $281 million, $268 million and $261 million, respectively. Because of the decline in Power segment earnings, which related largely to projects located in the United States, domestic operating profit declined significantly during 2004, offset by increases in foreign operating profits. The company had net earnings of $2.25 per share in 2004 compared with $1.95 per share in 2003 and $2.05 in 2002. Results in 2003 were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of $0.15 per share and a loss of $0.13 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results in 2002 include a loss from discontinued operations of $0.08 per share. The results of discontinued operations are further discussed below. The loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is discussed above under Accounting Pronouncements. Following is a discussion of the operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items. The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance (EPCM) and is organized into five business segments: Oil Gas, Industrial Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil Gas segment provides engineering and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial Infrastructure segment provides engineering and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities, commercial and institutional buildings, mining, microelectronics, chemicals, telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities. The Government segment provides project management, engineering, construction, and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, 24 Table of Contents construction equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services. The Power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities. Through the second quarter of 2004, services provided by the Power segment were conducted through two joint ventures; Duke/Fluor Daniel, a 50 percent owned partnership with Duke Energy, and ICA Fluor Daniel (ICA Fluor), a 49 percent owned joint venture with Grupo ICA, a Mexican company. As a result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor, commencing in the third quarter of 2004, its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment. Prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ICA Fluor. In July 2003, the company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation the decision to terminate the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership (D/FD) as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. The dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position of the company. The dissolution is in progress and is expected to be completed in 2005 as remaining project activities are concluded. The company has continued to identify and pursue power generation opportunities and future projects will be performed 100 percent by Fluor. Oil Gas Revenue in the Oil Gas segment amounted to $3.2 billion, $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 21 percent increase during 2004 resulted from a global increase in project activity which includes the impact of the transition to field activities on two major international projects where the volume of labor, material and subcontract work is greatest. The decrease in revenue during 2003 reflects the completion of several projects during the year and revenue recognition from projects awarded in 2003 that did not fully replace the revenue on the completed projects. Operating profit margin in the Oil Gas segment increased slightly, to 4.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The operating profit margin in 2003 increased to 4.6 percent compared with 3.7 percent in 2002 due to the higher content of project completions combined with improved execution performance. A major project that has reached mechanical completion in the Oil Gas segment is the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project (Hamaca) located in Jose, Venezuela. Hamaca is a $1.1 billion lump sum project (including $92 million of approved change orders) of Grupo Alvica (GA), a joint venture including Fluor Daniel (80 percent) and Inelectra C.A. (20 percent), to design and build a petroleum upgrader for a consortium of owners called Petrolera Ameriven (PA) including Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips. The GA joint venture is pursuing cost and schedule relief through arbitration proceedings for the following three issues: modifications and extra work arising from differing site soil conditions, costs arising from the site labor agreement for 2000 called Acta Convenio and events in Venezuela in early 2003, including a national strike and other force majeure incidents. Arbitration proceedings were commenced by GA in late 2001. The site soil conditions issue was the subject of arbitration hearings in November 2002. There are no monetary cross claims by PA in the arbitration. The amount of the claim for site soil conditions of $159 million includes the direct costs as well as significant delay related and indirect costs. In April 2004, the arbitration panel awarded GA $36 million for direct cost of the site soil conditions remediation work, virtually all of the amounts sought by GA for this issue. The client had previously conditionally accepted responsibility relating to the soil conditions matter and $28 million had been paid. The balance of the award amount was received in April 2004. The award confirmed GAs methodology for computing the amount of all change orders arising under the contract. In addition, the award also granted GA approximately 14 weeks of schedule relief. The delay and indirect costs were the subject of hearings in June 2004 and a decision is expected shortly. The hearings on the fundamental cost differences between the earlier 1998 labor agreement and the 2000 Acta Convenio were held in April 2003 and a decision on this issue is also expected shortly. The amount of the claim for Acta Convenio is $210 million and no payments have been made by the client relating to this matter. In accordance with the contract, the joint venture is entitled to cost and schedule relief for the impact of the national strike in Venezuela. A change order relating to the national strike in the approximate amount of $340 million was submitted by GA. This action was followed by the filing of an arbitration claim relating to this issue in January 2004. Hearings on this issue are now scheduled for March and April 2005. Other force majeure incidents occurring prior to the national strike also were the subject of arbitration hearings in October 2003. 25 Table of Contents Incurred costs associated with delay and indirect costs related to the soil conditions, Acta Convenio, the national strike and other claims are probable of being recovered and thus are being deferred. These costs will be recognized in revenue when a change order is approved or payment is received. As of December 31, 2004, incurred costs amounting to $249.7 million have been deferred. Subcontractor close outs will result in additional costs as contracts are settled. The company believes that schedule relief awarded in connection with the direct costs of the site soil conditions, along with other delay days requested on the other issues, will be sufficient to avoid the imposition of liquidated damages. If costs relating to Acta Convenio, soil conditions, the national strike or other claims are determined to be not recoverable or liquidated damages are assessed, the company could face materially reduced profits or losses on this project, along with lower levels of cash and additional borrowings. New awards in the Oil Gas segment were $3.6 billion in 2004, roughly equal to the $3.7 billion in 2003. New awards in 2003 increased 89 percent compared with $1.9 billion in 2002. New project awards in 2004 included a $570 million oil sands project and a $244 million clean fuels project, which are both in Canada, a $346 million refinery complex modernization project in Mexico and a $176 million refinery upgrade project in South Africa. New project awards in 2003 include the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project, a major oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. The increase in 2003 new awards is partly attributable to the TCO project which was expected to be awarded in 2002 but was temporarily suspended due to funding considerations that were resolved early in 2003. Also included in new awards in 2003 is the Sakhalin I program and construction management project led by ExxonMobil and a project for Lukoil, a major Russian oil company. The lower level of new awards in 2002 was primarily due to the previously mentioned temporary suspension of the TCO project. The large size and uncertain timing of complex, international projects can create variability in the segments award pattern; consequently, future award trends are difficult to predict with certainty. Backlog for the Oil Gas segment was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of 40 percent compared with $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003. The 2004 backlog growth included the impacts of new awards and the reclassification of ICA Fluor during the year. The $3.4 billion backlog at December 31, 2003 compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002. This increase was due to the higher level of new awards in 2003 and the lower level of work performed on these new awards that were in the early stages of project execution where activity is focused on engineering and project planning. Total assets in the Oil Gas segment increased to $665 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $508 million at December 31, 2003. The increase includes the impact of the growth in segment revenues, as well as increased deferred costs on the Hamaca project of $70 million. Industrial Infrastructure The Industrial Infrastructure segment had revenues of $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 12 percent decline in revenues during 2004 resulted from slow start up progress on recently awarded projects and a lower level of new awards in the latter half of 2003. In addition, as discussed below, certain projects that were removed from backlog in the third quarter of 2003 also had a negative impact on the volume of work performed in 2004. The 8 percent increase in revenues during 2003 primarily reflects the higher volume of work performed on life sciences projects awarded in 2002 partially offset by lower volume of work performed on mining projects as a number of projects were completed in 2002. Operating profit margin for the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased to 3.0 percent in 2004 compared with 2.4 percent in 2003. Operating profit for the segment has been impacted in all three years by provisions relating to specific projects. During 2004, a $28 million provision due to estimated cost overruns resulting in a loss on a transportation infrastructure project was partially offset by a $7.2 million positive impact from recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the Verde Gold project, which is further discussed below. In 2003 operating profit was negatively impacted by a $7.4 million charge relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in Australia. The investment was committed in previous years as part of a consulting arrangement with the client wherein the company agreed to be compensated for its services in shares of the clients capital stock. Due to funding considerations, continued development of the project was suspended, resulting in the client seeking bankruptcy protection. Because the company was not the execution contractor there was no impact on backlog or operating results from project execution. The 2003 operating profit margin in the Industrial Infrastructure segment was essentially flat with 2002. In 2003 margins were reduced by the equity investment write down discussed above, a higher volume of construction management work which has reduced margins due to lower risk and lack of project margin on projects that were removed from backlog which are discussed further below. A $26 million dispute resolution provision in 2002 primarily relates to an unfavorable 26 Table of Contents arbitration ruling on the Verde Gold project in Chile, a gold ore processing facility completed in 1996. During the second quarter of 2002, the company recognized a loss provision from Verde Gold of $20 million representing the arbitration award plus applicable interest, less a $3 million reserve provided in prior years and expected insurance recoveries. The net impact on results of operations for 2002 was a charge of $14 million. New awards in the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased to $5.0 billion during 2004, compared with $2.6 billion during 2003 and $3.5 billion in 2002. New awards in 2004 include a variety of mining, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and manufacturing projects throughout the world. The decline in new awards in 2003 resulted from economic weakness in the mining, telecommunications and manufacturing markets reflecting overcapacity and poor commodity pricing in these industries. New awards in 2002 included a substantial award for the SH 130 toll road project in Texas. Backlog for the Industrial Infrastructure segment grew to $5.7 billion during 2004 following a decline to $3.3 billion at the end of 2003, compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2002. The growth during 2004 was reflective of the substantial new awards during the year. Contributing to the 2003 decline was the removal of $750 million for three projects that had been booked during the previous two years. One of these was a mining project that was removed due to considerations relating to ongoing financing. The other two were commercial projects that the company decided not to execute due to evolving changes in industry liability. Government The Government segment had revenues of $2.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 34 percent increase in revenue during 2004 resulted principally from reconstruction activity in Iraq, strong performance on environmental remediation programs for the Department of Energy (DOE), and businesses acquired over the last two years. Del Jen, Inc. (Del Jen) was acquired late in the first quarter of 2003 and J.A. Jones was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, Trend Western was acquired by Del Jen in the first quarter of 2004. In total, these acquired businesses contributed $371.1 million of revenue in 2004, compared with $153.1 million from the acquired businesses in 2003. In addition to the impact of business acquisitions, the 78 percent increase during 2003 included a substantial increase in work performed for the Department of Defense on the Midcourse Missile Defense test bed facilities in Alaska, the Department of State for an embassy project in Brazil and new awards for task orders in Iraq. Revenue in all periods includes work for ongoing environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project (Fernald) in Ohio and the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. The operating profit margin for the Government segment was 3.7 percent during 2004, up from 2.8 percent during 2003. This improvement reflects improved contract performance and a higher level of costs related to proposal activity in the prior year. Operating profit margin for the Government segment declined to 2.8 percent in 2003 compared with 3.1 percent in 2002. Contributing to this decline was the impact of a particularly high level of proposal costs during 2003 as the segment pursued a number of new opportunities. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months. Total assets in the Government segment increased to $654 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $475 million at December 31, 2003. The segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling $91.1 million related to the Fernald project. The project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in 2007. Deferred fees recognized in revenue in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $36.8 million, $21.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in segment assets was a significant increase in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to projects performed in the Middle East. Global Services The Global Services segment had revenues of $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 16 percent growth during 2004 was primarily the result of increased operations and maintenance activity. The 15 percent increase in revenue in 2003 includes $151.6 million from Plant Performance Services (P2S), which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of that year. Revenue during 2002 also reflects the impact of selectivity to improve margins and depressed economic conditions resulting in lower operations and maintenance activity in the manufacturing sector during that year. 27 Table of Contents Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 7.8 percent, 8.7 percent and 9.7 percent 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The declines during 2004 and 2003 were the combined result of lower levels of company wide construction activity, which impacted the segments construction equipment business, and reduced margins that resulted from competitive factors in the operations and maintenance business. New awards in the Global Services segment for operations and maintenance projects increased 23 percent, to $1.5 billion during 2004, compared to $1.3 billion during 2003. A significant multi year contract for a new client in the United Kingdom was awarded during the fourth quarter of 2004. New awards for 2003 of $1.3 billion represented an increase of 23 percent over 2002. This increase is primarily due to the contribution from P2S, as well as a lower level of new awards in 2002 that was attributable to increased selectivity and the depressed economic conditions in the manufacturing sector. Backlog for the Global Services segment increased by 24 percent, to $2.3 billion, at December 31, 2004, compared with $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003. This growth was principally the result of the large new award discussed in the preceding paragraph. In previous years, backlog was fairly stable at $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2002. This relative stability is due in part to the multi year nature of operations and maintenance contracts where consistent and efficient performance results in long term client relationships. The equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. Power The Power segment has experienced significant declines in revenue during recent years, to $326 million during 2004 from $759 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $2.2 billion in 2002. This decline is due to the substantial work off of projects in backlog that were awarded in prior years. The segment has experienced a substantial reduction in new awards over the last several years as demand for new power generation has diminished following a strong cycle of power plant construction activity. As a result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor, commencing in the third quarter of 2004, its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment rather than the Power segment where it was previously reported. Operating profit margin in the Power segment declined to 4.2 percent during 2004 from a very strong 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003. The current year performance was negatively impacted by the completion of a major cycle of investment in power projects and unexpected costs associated with the start up and commissioning of a waste coal power plant during the third quarter of the year. Operating profit margin during 2002 was 4.9 percent. Although operating profit declined in 2003 to $77 million compared to $107 million in 2002 due to the decline in the power market, the strong margin performance in 2003 was attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of projects. Projects in the Power segment are primarily bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. New awards in the Power segment recovered somewhat during 2004, to $612 million from $485 million for 2003. Two awards during the fourth quarter 2004 were the largest contributors to this growth. One was for the recommissioning of a power plant in South Africa and the other was for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in Nevada. New awards declined to $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $1.1 billion in 2002. Backlog for the Power segment decreased to $552 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $605 million at December 31, 2003 and $841 million at December 31, 2002. The 2004 decline includes the impact of the movement of ICA Fluor to the Oil Gas segment. Most of the projects awarded in prior years have now been completed. New award activity for the near term future is expected to be modest as existing power generation capacity is expected to meet anticipated demand. Corporate For the year ended December 31, 2004 corporate administrative and general expenses were $142.4 million, compared with $141.5 million in the prior year. Included in the 2004 amount are non operating pretax gains of $5.5 million related to the final disposal of a residual interest in a property that was sold by the company in 1985 and $7.1 million from real estate sales. Those real estate gains, in addition to savings from successful expense reduction programs and favorable pension adjustments, were offset by higher executive incentives and costs of complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Corporate administrative and general expense, excluding non operating items, increased four percent in 2003 28 Table of Contents compared with 2002 primarily due to higher management incentive compensation costs. Non operating items in 2002 included charges relating to the reevaluation of the companys enterprise resource management (ERM) system, recognition of a provision for a guarantee obligation and a provision to recognize impairment related to an investment in The Beacon Group Energy Investment Fund, L.P. that were recognized in that year. Partially offsetting these charges in 2002 was the recognition of a gain relating to the demutualization of an insurance company in which the company had an investment. During 2002 significant cost reductions were realized as a result of the companys reevaluation of the scope of implementation and deployment of its ERM system (formerly known as Knowledge@Work). As part of this reevaluation effort the company altered the original ERM implementation plan and recognized a charge of $13.0 million in 2002 for abandonment of certain system functionality and to adjust depreciation expense. This charge partially offset the impact of the cost reductions realized upon changing the implementation and deployment plan. Net interest income was $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Lower net interest income in 2004 and 2003 compared with 2002 is primarily the result of lower cash balances and increased short term borrowings. The effective tax rates on the companys continuing operations were 33.6 percent, 33.0 percent and 34.8 percent for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The slight rise in the tax rate in 2004 compared with 2003 is primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses as well as capital and foreign losses that received no tax benefits. Such increase, however, was partially offset by the decrease in state income taxes largely attributable to the utilization of prior year net operating losses in California, which losses were suspended in 2003 and 2002 due to the states deficit position. In addition, during 2004 the company disposed of certain business assets, which resulted in a favorable effective tax rate variance due to certain permanent book/tax basis differences. The tax rate in 2003 compared with 2002 was lower substantially due to the tax benefits from favorable tax return adjustments and settlements. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the Act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales that is viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the European Union. The company expects the net effect of the phase out of the ETI and the phase in of this new deduction to result in an increase in its effective tax rate for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 of approximately one to two percentage points, based on anticipated earnings levels. In the long term, the company does not expect to receive significant tax benefits from this new qualified domestic production deduction due to a shift of project mix to more international projects. Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the Act, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in FASB Statement No. 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the companys tax return. Also included in the Act is a provision that incentivizes U.S. multinationals to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing a special one time 85 percent dividend received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment and repatriation guidelines and certain limitations. The company may elect to apply this provision in 2005 and is in the process of evaluating its effect on the company, taking into account its reinvestment options and its operational working capital needs worldwide. The amount of the qualified dividend to be repatriated under this provision is yet to be determined, pending the completion of this evaluation, the passage of the Technical Corrections Bill by Congress and the issuance of additional guidance by the United States Department of the Treasury. 29 Table of Contents Matters in Dispute Resolution During 2004, several matters relating to certain significant completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of these matters: Murrin Murrin On May 5, 2004, Fluor Australia and its client, Anaconda Nickel (Anaconda) entered into a settlement agreement resolving all disputes related to the Murrin Murrin Nickel Cobalt project located in Western Australia. Fluor Australia paid the equivalent of approximately US$120 million to end all remaining claims under both the first and second phases of arbitration, including any appeals. The payment had no material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations as the amount, including defense costs, was funded by the companys insurers. In September 2002, the first phase of arbitration resulted in an amended award to Anaconda of approximately US$84.0 million and an award to Fluor Australia of approximately US$59.9 million for amounts owing from Anaconda under the contract. The company had previously recovered the first phase award plus substantially all defense costs incurred from available insurance. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. V. General Electric Company, et al U.S.D.C., Southern District Court, New York In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded and a decision on entitlement is expected shortly and a decision on damages is expected later in 2005. Dearborn Industrial Project Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan. The initial Turnkey Agreement, dated November 24, 1998, consisted of three phases. Commencing shortly after Notice to Proceed, the owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. The Project was severely delayed with completion of Phase II. DIG unilaterally took over completion and operation of Phase II and commissioned that portion of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit which Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute. D/FD retains lien rights (in fee) against the project. In October 2001, D/FD commenced an action in Michigan State Court to foreclose on the lien interest. In December 2001, DIG filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to D/FD claiming, among other things, that D/FD is liable to DIG for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the Dearborn plant. The court has ordered the matter to arbitration. The lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of D/FDs claims against DIG and DIGs claims against D/FD. An arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration is scheduled to begin in October 2005. Hamaca Crude Upgrader See discussion regarding the Hamaca project above under Oil Gas. 30 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and non EPCM components of its temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and completed as of the end of 2003. Operating results for these non core businesses have been reclassified and are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During 2003 the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of $31.9 million. In 2002, the sale of one dealership subsidiary resulted in cash proceeds of $45.9 million. Other dealership asset disposals during 2002 produced proceeds of $51 million. During the second quarter of 2002, the Australian operations of the temporary staffing business that was sold resulted in cash proceeds of $5.1 million. The temporary staffing industry experienced severe competition in 2002 due to depressed economic conditions, which resulted in significant erosion in the fair value of those businesses. As a result, the company recognized adjustments to the carrying value of the U.S. and U.K. based disposal groups. The sales of the U.S. and U.K. operations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, resulting in proceeds of $2 million. Disposal of the construction equipment operations in Argentina and Peru were finalized in 2002 resulting in proceeds of $5.1 million primarily from collection of accounts receivable and sales of inventory and equipment. Interest expense was not reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with the non core businesses because disposal of these operations did not include any debt to be assumed by the buyers. Revenue and the results of operations, including loss on disposal, for all discontinued operations are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 (in thousands) Revenues: Dealership operations $ 30,097 $ 155,909 Other equipment operations 7,880 Temporary staffing operations 34 67,661 Total revenues $ 30,131 $ 231,450 Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations: Dealership operations $ 2,575 $ 4,214 Other equipment operations 117 213 Temporary staffing operations (404 ) (4,036 ) Earnings from discontinued operations before tax 2,288 391 Provision for taxes 800 891 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,488 $ (500 ) Loss on disposal before tax $ (7,386 ) $ (8,770 ) Provision for taxes (tax benefit) 5,718 (2,909 ) Loss on disposal $ (13,104 ) $ (5,861 ) There have been no results of operations reported as discontinued operations for any period subsequent to June 30, 2003. The loss on disposal in all periods presented above is for impairment provisions to adjust the carrying value of the assets held for sale of the various individual non core businesses to fair value. Impairment provisions for the equipment operations included adjustments to the carrying value of equipment inventories, fixed assets and goodwill. Impairment provisions for the temporary staffing operations primarily included adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill. 31 Table of Contents Financial Position and Liquidity Cash utilized by operating activities in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to the significant use of cash to fund project operations. This compares to cash provided by operating activities in 2002. Significant cash was used in 2004, 2003 and 2002 to fund projects in the Power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of $44.5 million, $212.8 million and $282.1 million, respectively. These advances represented the companys proportional share of excess cash from Duke/Fluor Daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in 2001 and prior years upon award of projects. The joint venture partners managed excess cash of Duke/Fluor Daniel through these proportional advances. Client advances on Duke/Fluor Daniel projects have been a normal condition of contracts in the power industry where most of the projects are negotiated on a fixed price basis. As these projects progress, the expenditures for labor and materials are partially funded from these advance payments. With the completion of nearly all work on Duke/Fluor Daniel projects as of December 31, 2004, the amounts advanced to the company have been substantially repaid to the partnership and used in project execution. The company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation in July 2003, the decision to dissolve the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. The dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on future operating cash flows. The company also used significant cash in 2004 and 2003 to fund ongoing work and the change orders that are in the dispute resolution process relating to the Hamaca project in Venezuela. The company has incurred substantial costs relating to the change orders for which it is not currently being paid pending resolution through arbitration. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had incurred $249.7 million and $179.6 million, respectively, in deferred costs on this project. During 2004 and 2003, ongoing work on Hamaca not associated with change orders used approximately $59 million and $80 million, respectively, of cash from advances received in prior years. Excluding the impact of the repayment of advances relating to power projects and the funding for the Hamaca project, cash was used to fund other changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily associated with engineering and construction activities. There has also been a significant increase in operating assets and liabilities totaling approximately $56 million in 2004 and $126 million in 2003 relating to work in the Government segment, primarily in connection with start up and ongoing activities on the CETAC and AFCAP projects in the Middle East in 2004 and 2003, as well as the Missile Defense work in Alaska in 2003. The projects in the Middle East required rapid deployment starting late in the fourth quarter of 2003, which resulted in substantial initial investment of working capital. Reconstruction activity in Iraq during 2004 required additional working capital. Working capital of the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased by $108 million during 2004 due to the startup of several large projects in the latter part of the year. Early start up activities and ongoing progress on major Oil Gas projects other than Hamaca required investments in operating working capital of $83 million in 2003. During 2003, approximately $44 million of working capital was provided to P2S, which was acquired early in that year. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. Cash utilized by operating activities is also impacted by contributions to the companys defined benefit retirement plans. Contributions in 2004 amounted to $30 million compared with $52 million and $110 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The large contributions in 2003 and 2002 were due in part to lower than expected investment results on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan was not fully funded in 2004 and 2003 and the minimum pension liability amounts were $34 million and $28 million, respectively, for this plan. The company recognized a minimum liability plus elimination of $12 million of pension assets in 2002, resulting in an after tax charge of $29 million in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity. During 2003 and 2002, the receipt of funds from insurance claims relating to the Murrin Murrin project amounted to $84.1 million and $35.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, amounts due from the insurance companies for claims submitted had been collected except for minor amounts of arbitration defense costs. Activities in 2002 associated with the disposal of certain discontinued equipment and temporary staffing businesses generated $24 million of cash from liquidation of operating assets and liabilities, primarily from accounts receivable and inventories. Business acquisitions utilized cash of $33.0 million during 2004 (for the acquisition of Trend Western) and $54.5 million during 2003 (for the acquisition of Del Jen, P2S and J.A. Jones International). Cash flows from investing activities during 32 Table of Contents 2004 included $58.6 million from the sale of three excess real estate assets and a residual property interest and $22.2 million from the disposal of other property, plant and equipment. During 2003 the company realized $26.1 million from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and $31.9 million in proceeds from the sale of the last discontinued equipment dealership operation. Cash provided by investing activities in 2002 was benefited by the sale and liquidation activities associated with discontinued operations. Sales of discontinued businesses during that year generated $101 million in proceeds from the liquidation of property, plant and equipment and sales of dealership and temporary staffing businesses. Partially offsetting these proceeds were capital expenditures of $16 million primarily for the one remaining equipment dealership that was sold later in 2003. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002 included capital expenditures of $104.4 million, $79.2 million and $63.0 million, respectively, for continuing operations. Capital expenditures for continuing operations primarily relate to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures from 2003 to 2004 related largely to rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq. The decision to divest certain equipment operations substantially reduced the companys capital investment requirements. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, facility renewal and refurbishment, and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. In July 2004, the company entered into a new, five year, $800 million Senior Credit Facility. The agreement replaced existing facilities totaling $700 million. Of the total capacity, $300 million is dedicated to commercial paper back up lines. The balance is available for letters of credit and funded loans. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, primarily in response to significant increases in funds required for project operations, the company had outstanding borrowings of $129.9 million and $121.5 million, respectively, in the commercial paper market. Liquidity is further provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress, which, prior to 2004 included the companys proportional share of excess cash that was advanced to the company by Duke/Fluor Daniel (see discussion above). As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. Cash has also been required to fund work performed on the Hamaca project in Venezuela. This project incurred significant costs for work relating to change orders that are subject to arbitration proceedings. The increase in new awards over the last two years will continue to result in start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Over the next 12 months cash required to fund start up and ongoing project activities is expected to result in an increase in net operating assets and liabilities and may reduce available cash balances or require other sources of funding including additional short or long term borrowings or equity offerings. During 2004 the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off all outstanding commercial paper and $100.0 million was used to obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. In December 2004 the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. No securities have been issued under this filing. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains amounting to $40.0 million, $45.1 million and $20.9 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. 33 Table of Contents Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $61.7 million, $28.5 million and $14.9 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. No purchases were made during 2004. During 2003 and 2002, the company purchased 94,000 shares for total consideration of $2.7 million and 726,000 shares for total consideration of $19.2 million, respectively. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. There is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program. Cash dividends declared and paid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were at the rate of $0.64 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand, short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $825 million in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. In addition, the company has $52 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2004, the company had utilized $392 million of its letter of credit capacity. The company also posts surety bonds primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total Under 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Long term Debt: Convertible Senior Notes $ 330 $ $ $ $ 330 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Operating leases (1) 275 29 53 42 151 Compensation related obligations 296 30 67 82 117 Pollution control bonds 7 2 5 Total $ 926 $ 61 $ 125 $ 124 $ 616 (1) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other domestic and international locations. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2004. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the amount payable under a guarantee is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. 34 Table of Contents Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2004, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $4 million. The remaining outstanding amount of a financial guarantee for $7 million of pollution control bonds related to zinc operations that were sold in 1987 has been recognized at the full amount of the underlying obligation. The obligation was recognized by a charge to earnings in 2002 due to the obligors bankruptcy filing and inability to meet the current obligation on the bonds without financial assistance from the company. Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix costs at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. Debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon on all long term debt. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on its long term debt is not material due to the low fixed interest rates on the obligations. However, commercial paper is issued at current short term interest rates, which could increase in the future. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2004, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 27 months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2004 was $54 million. Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. Most of these unrealized gains relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held, the risk of realized translation losses is mitigated. In 2001, the company issued a warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares, at $36.06 per share, of the companys common stock to a partner in the companys e commerce procurement venture. Any compensation realized by the holder through exercise of the warrant will offset any royalties otherwise payable under a five year cooperation and services agreement. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non operating income and expense items; earnings or loss from discontinued operations; and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Accounting Pronouncements Following is a discussion of the impact of accounting and financial reporting pronouncements that have been applied in the preparation of the companys Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. This information is provided to assist in an understanding of the impact such changes have had on the companys financial reporting. Unless a specific reference is made to a new pronouncement, the company has determined that the pronouncement either does not apply to its business or that the impact of applying the pronouncement is not significant. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45 or the Interpretation). FIN 45 expands on the accounting and disclosure requirements under existing accounting standards. It clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation. Disclosures required by the Interpretation are provided below in the Financial Position and Liquidity section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. The accounting requirements of the Interpretation are applicable to transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2003. Application of this Interpretation did not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in 2004 or 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R). FIN 46 R provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. The companys engineering office facilities in Aliso Viejo, California (Aliso Viejo) and Calgary, Canada (Calgary) were leased through arrangements involving variable interest entities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, the company consolidated these entities in its financial statements as prescribed by FIN 46 R. At December 31, 2003, the effect of this consolidation resulted in an increase of $100 million and $27 million in reported short term and long term debt, respectively, and an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment of $107 million. None of the terms of the leasing arrangements or the companys obligations as a lessee were impacted by this change in accounting. The cumulative impact of the difference in earnings, amounting to a charge of $10.4 million net of tax, relating to prior years was reported in the first quarter of 2003 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. During 2004, the company exercised options to purchase both the Aliso Viejo ($100 million) and Calgary ($29 million) engineering and office facilities. These amounts are reported as repayments of facilities financing in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards. 20 Table of Contents On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2) providing guidance on accounting for the effects of the Act and specific disclosure requirements. Based on an analysis of the Act, the company has concluded that its retiree medical plans provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The company adopted the provisions of FSP 106 2 as of July 1, 2004 and recorded the effects of the subsidy in measuring net periodic postretirement benefit cost during the quarter ended September 30, 2004. This resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits attributed to past service of $2.9 million and a pretax reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit costs of $0.3 million for the second half of the year. In September 2004, the EITF reached a final consensus on Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share (Issue 04 8), that became effective for the company on December 31, 2004. Contingently convertible debt instruments (commonly referred to as Co Cos) are financial instruments that add a contingent feature to a convertible debt instrument. The conversion feature is triggered when one or more specified contingencies occur and at least one of these contingencies is based on market price. Prior to the issuance of the final consensus on Issue No. 04 8 by the EITF, the company applied a widely held interpretation that Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, Earnings per Share, allowed the exclusion of common shares underlying contingently convertible debt instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) in instances where conversion depends on the achievement of a specified market price of the issuers shares and such price had not been attained. Issue 04 8 requires that these underlying common shares be included in the diluted EPS computations, if dilutive, regardless of whether the market price contingency or any other contingent factor has been met. However, principal amounts that must be settled entirely in cash may be excluded from the computations. Prior to the end of 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash, and therefore, there will be no dilutive impact until the average price of the companys stock exceeds the conversion price of $55.94. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the conversion price has been exceeded. If the companys stock price is in excess of the conversion price as of March 31, 2005, the company will then use the treasury stock method of accounting for the excess of the market stock price over $55.94 in calculating diluted EPS. Upon conversion, any stock appreciation amount above the conversion price of $55.94 will be satisfied by the company through the issuance of common stock which thereafter will be included in calculating both basic and diluted EPS. Because the company has irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the debt in cash, previously reported diluted EPS for the first, second, and third quarters of 2004 will not change as a result of the consensus on Issue 04 8. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Upon adoption of SFAS 123 R, pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer permitted. SFAS 123 R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The company expects to adopt SFAS 123 R on January 1, 2005, using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123 R that remain unvested on the effective date. As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to APB 25 and, as such, recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123 Rs fair value method will have an impact on results of operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123 R will not be material based on unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2004. Had SFAS 123 R been adopted in prior periods, the impact would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the Stock Plan footnote under Major Accounting Policies in the 21 Table of Contents accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123 R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This requirement will generally impact cash provided or utilized by operating activities with offsets in cash flows from financing activities in periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $14 million, $4 million, and $2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor costs and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, or achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract costs and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2004, 73 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while 27 percent was for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues realized from the projects. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made certain claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $105 million and $24 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and costs, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues, costs and operating profits in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the Power, Oil Gas and Industrial Infrastructure segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company 22 Table of Contents engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles. Foreign Currency The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. The company does not engage in currency speculation. In connection with the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project located in Jose, Venezuela, the company has incurred foreign currency exposures and related translation losses due to weakness in the Venezuelan Bolivar compared with the U.S. dollar. See additional discussion concerning the Hamaca project below under Results of Operations Oil Gas. Deferred Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2004 the company had deferred tax assets of $272.8 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $57.9 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $55.4 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards, net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain project performance reserves. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Recent decreases in long term interest rates have the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $35 million and $70 million for the calendar year 2005. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $32 million. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results During 2004, revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with 2003. Revenue of the Oil Gas segment was favorably impacted during the year by increased work performed associated with the transition to field activities on two major international projects. Additionally, a positive trend for new awards in the Government segment resulted in a significant increase in work performed in Iraq on projects for the U.S. Government in 2004. The company also benefited from increased revenues beginning in the first quarter of 2004 from business acquisitions completed in 2003 and early 2004. Offsetting these improvements has been a continued trend away from power projects. Revenues and earnings from continuing operations were also negatively impacted by the lower level of new project awards in the economically sensitive mining, chemicals and manufacturing markets experienced in 2003. In addition, the companys 2003 decision to suspend performance on a mining project and withdraw from certain commercial projects had a negative impact on 2003 backlog and the volume of work performed in 2004. Revenue declined 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to declines in the Power and Oil Gas segments. Earnings from continuing operations increased 6 percent primarily due to the improved performance of the Government, Industrial Infrastructure and Global Services Segments. Also contributing to the improvement was lower reported corporate administrative and general expense due to the absence of several non operating charges that were included in 2002, and a lower tax rate on earnings from continuing operations. The company experienced a significant decline in Power segment revenue and earnings over the last two years as projects in the segment were completed and the contribution from new awards declined due to the cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction. Partially offsetting this trend in Power is an increasing trend for new awards in the Industrial Infrastructure and Government segments. Following a low level in 2002, new awards in the Oil Gas segment have rebounded in 2003 and 2004. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in the early stages of a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next three to five years. New awards in the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased significantly in 2004 and were distributed primarily across the mining, chemicals and life sciences markets, reflecting improved economics supporting capital spending commitments. In addition, the trend for new awards in the Government segment has increased due to awards for work in Iraq as well as the completion of the acquisitions of the International Division of J.A. Jones Construction Company (J.A. Jones) and Trend Western Technical Corporation (Trend Western). These acquisitions improve the companys service offering to both the Department of State and Department of Defense. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes for the three years ended December 31, 2004 were $281 million, $268 million and $261 million, respectively. Because of the decline in Power segment earnings, which related largely to projects located in the United States, domestic operating profit declined significantly during 2004, offset by increases in foreign operating profits. The company had net earnings of $2.25 per share in 2004 compared with $1.95 per share in 2003 and $2.05 in 2002. Results in 2003 were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of $0.15 per share and a loss of $0.13 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results in 2002 include a loss from discontinued operations of $0.08 per share. The results of discontinued operations are further discussed below. The loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is discussed above under Accounting Pronouncements. Following is a discussion of the operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items. The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance (EPCM) and is organized into five business segments: Oil Gas, Industrial Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil Gas segment provides engineering and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial Infrastructure segment provides engineering and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities, commercial and institutional buildings, mining, microelectronics, chemicals, telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities. The Government segment provides project management, engineering, construction, and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, 24 Table of Contents construction equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services. The Power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities. Through the second quarter of 2004, services provided by the Power segment were conducted through two joint ventures; Duke/Fluor Daniel, a 50 percent owned partnership with Duke Energy, and ICA Fluor Daniel (ICA Fluor), a 49 percent owned joint venture with Grupo ICA, a Mexican company. As a result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor, commencing in the third quarter of 2004, its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment. Prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ICA Fluor. In July 2003, the company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation the decision to terminate the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership (D/FD) as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. The dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position of the company. The dissolution is in progress and is expected to be completed in 2005 as remaining project activities are concluded. The company has continued to identify and pursue power generation opportunities and future projects will be performed 100 percent by Fluor. Oil Gas Revenue in the Oil Gas segment amounted to $3.2 billion, $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 21 percent increase during 2004 resulted from a global increase in project activity which includes the impact of the transition to field activities on two major international projects where the volume of labor, material and subcontract work is greatest. The decrease in revenue during 2003 reflects the completion of several projects during the year and revenue recognition from projects awarded in 2003 that did not fully replace the revenue on the completed projects. Operating profit margin in the Oil Gas segment increased slightly, to 4.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The operating profit margin in 2003 increased to 4.6 percent compared with 3.7 percent in 2002 due to the higher content of project completions combined with improved execution performance. A major project that has reached mechanical completion in the Oil Gas segment is the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project (Hamaca) located in Jose, Venezuela. Hamaca is a $1.1 billion lump sum project (including $92 million of approved change orders) of Grupo Alvica (GA), a joint venture including Fluor Daniel (80 percent) and Inelectra C.A. (20 percent), to design and build a petroleum upgrader for a consortium of owners called Petrolera Ameriven (PA) including Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips. The GA joint venture is pursuing cost and schedule relief through arbitration proceedings for the following three issues: modifications and extra work arising from differing site soil conditions, costs arising from the site labor agreement for 2000 called Acta Convenio and events in Venezuela in early 2003, including a national strike and other force majeure incidents. Arbitration proceedings were commenced by GA in late 2001. The site soil conditions issue was the subject of arbitration hearings in November 2002. There are no monetary cross claims by PA in the arbitration. The amount of the claim for site soil conditions of $159 million includes the direct costs as well as significant delay related and indirect costs. In April 2004, the arbitration panel awarded GA $36 million for direct cost of the site soil conditions remediation work, virtually all of the amounts sought by GA for this issue. The client had previously conditionally accepted responsibility relating to the soil conditions matter and $28 million had been paid. The balance of the award amount was received in April 2004. The award confirmed GAs methodology for computing the amount of all change orders arising under the contract. In addition, the award also granted GA approximately 14 weeks of schedule relief. The delay and indirect costs were the subject of hearings in June 2004 and a decision is expected shortly. The hearings on the fundamental cost differences between the earlier 1998 labor agreement and the 2000 Acta Convenio were held in April 2003 and a decision on this issue is also expected shortly. The amount of the claim for Acta Convenio is $210 million and no payments have been made by the client relating to this matter. In accordance with the contract, the joint venture is entitled to cost and schedule relief for the impact of the national strike in Venezuela. A change order relating to the national strike in the approximate amount of $340 million was submitted by GA. This action was followed by the filing of an arbitration claim relating to this issue in January 2004. Hearings on this issue are now scheduled for March and April 2005. Other force majeure incidents occurring prior to the national strike also were the subject of arbitration hearings in October 2003. 25 Table of Contents Incurred costs associated with delay and indirect costs related to the soil conditions, Acta Convenio, the national strike and other claims are probable of being recovered and thus are being deferred. These costs will be recognized in revenue when a change order is approved or payment is received. As of December 31, 2004, incurred costs amounting to $249.7 million have been deferred. Subcontractor close outs will result in additional costs as contracts are settled. The company believes that schedule relief awarded in connection with the direct costs of the site soil conditions, along with other delay days requested on the other issues, will be sufficient to avoid the imposition of liquidated damages. If costs relating to Acta Convenio, soil conditions, the national strike or other claims are determined to be not recoverable or liquidated damages are assessed, the company could face materially reduced profits or losses on this project, along with lower levels of cash and additional borrowings. New awards in the Oil Gas segment were $3.6 billion in 2004, roughly equal to the $3.7 billion in 2003. New awards in 2003 increased 89 percent compared with $1.9 billion in 2002. New project awards in 2004 included a $570 million oil sands project and a $244 million clean fuels project, which are both in Canada, a $346 million refinery complex modernization project in Mexico and a $176 million refinery upgrade project in South Africa. New project awards in 2003 include the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project, a major oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. The increase in 2003 new awards is partly attributable to the TCO project which was expected to be awarded in 2002 but was temporarily suspended due to funding considerations that were resolved early in 2003. Also included in new awards in 2003 is the Sakhalin I program and construction management project led by ExxonMobil and a project for Lukoil, a major Russian oil company. The lower level of new awards in 2002 was primarily due to the previously mentioned temporary suspension of the TCO project. The large size and uncertain timing of complex, international projects can create variability in the segments award pattern; consequently, future award trends are difficult to predict with certainty. Backlog for the Oil Gas segment was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of 40 percent compared with $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003. The 2004 backlog growth included the impacts of new awards and the reclassification of ICA Fluor during the year. The $3.4 billion backlog at December 31, 2003 compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2002. This increase was due to the higher level of new awards in 2003 and the lower level of work performed on these new awards that were in the early stages of project execution where activity is focused on engineering and project planning. Total assets in the Oil Gas segment increased to $665 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $508 million at December 31, 2003. The increase includes the impact of the growth in segment revenues, as well as increased deferred costs on the Hamaca project of $70 million. Industrial Infrastructure The Industrial Infrastructure segment had revenues of $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 12 percent decline in revenues during 2004 resulted from slow start up progress on recently awarded projects and a lower level of new awards in the latter half of 2003. In addition, as discussed below, certain projects that were removed from backlog in the third quarter of 2003 also had a negative impact on the volume of work performed in 2004. The 8 percent increase in revenues during 2003 primarily reflects the higher volume of work performed on life sciences projects awarded in 2002 partially offset by lower volume of work performed on mining projects as a number of projects were completed in 2002. Operating profit margin for the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased to 3.0 percent in 2004 compared with 2.4 percent in 2003. Operating profit for the segment has been impacted in all three years by provisions relating to specific projects. During 2004, a $28 million provision due to estimated cost overruns resulting in a loss on a transportation infrastructure project was partially offset by a $7.2 million positive impact from recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the Verde Gold project, which is further discussed below. In 2003 operating profit was negatively impacted by a $7.4 million charge relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in Australia. The investment was committed in previous years as part of a consulting arrangement with the client wherein the company agreed to be compensated for its services in shares of the clients capital stock. Due to funding considerations, continued development of the project was suspended, resulting in the client seeking bankruptcy protection. Because the company was not the execution contractor there was no impact on backlog or operating results from project execution. The 2003 operating profit margin in the Industrial Infrastructure segment was essentially flat with 2002. In 2003 margins were reduced by the equity investment write down discussed above, a higher volume of construction management work which has reduced margins due to lower risk and lack of project margin on projects that were removed from backlog which are discussed further below. A $26 million dispute resolution provision in 2002 primarily relates to an unfavorable 26 Table of Contents arbitration ruling on the Verde Gold project in Chile, a gold ore processing facility completed in 1996. During the second quarter of 2002, the company recognized a loss provision from Verde Gold of $20 million representing the arbitration award plus applicable interest, less a $3 million reserve provided in prior years and expected insurance recoveries. The net impact on results of operations for 2002 was a charge of $14 million. New awards in the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased to $5.0 billion during 2004, compared with $2.6 billion during 2003 and $3.5 billion in 2002. New awards in 2004 include a variety of mining, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and manufacturing projects throughout the world. The decline in new awards in 2003 resulted from economic weakness in the mining, telecommunications and manufacturing markets reflecting overcapacity and poor commodity pricing in these industries. New awards in 2002 included a substantial award for the SH 130 toll road project in Texas. Backlog for the Industrial Infrastructure segment grew to $5.7 billion during 2004 following a decline to $3.3 billion at the end of 2003, compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2002. The growth during 2004 was reflective of the substantial new awards during the year. Contributing to the 2003 decline was the removal of $750 million for three projects that had been booked during the previous two years. One of these was a mining project that was removed due to considerations relating to ongoing financing. The other two were commercial projects that the company decided not to execute due to evolving changes in industry liability. Government The Government segment had revenues of $2.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 34 percent increase in revenue during 2004 resulted principally from reconstruction activity in Iraq, strong performance on environmental remediation programs for the Department of Energy (DOE), and businesses acquired over the last two years. Del Jen, Inc. (Del Jen) was acquired late in the first quarter of 2003 and J.A. Jones was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, Trend Western was acquired by Del Jen in the first quarter of 2004. In total, these acquired businesses contributed $371.1 million of revenue in 2004, compared with $153.1 million from the acquired businesses in 2003. In addition to the impact of business acquisitions, the 78 percent increase during 2003 included a substantial increase in work performed for the Department of Defense on the Midcourse Missile Defense test bed facilities in Alaska, the Department of State for an embassy project in Brazil and new awards for task orders in Iraq. Revenue in all periods includes work for ongoing environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project (Fernald) in Ohio and the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. The operating profit margin for the Government segment was 3.7 percent during 2004, up from 2.8 percent during 2003. This improvement reflects improved contract performance and a higher level of costs related to proposal activity in the prior year. Operating profit margin for the Government segment declined to 2.8 percent in 2003 compared with 3.1 percent in 2002. Contributing to this decline was the impact of a particularly high level of proposal costs during 2003 as the segment pursued a number of new opportunities. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months. Total assets in the Government segment increased to $654 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $475 million at December 31, 2003. The segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling $91.1 million related to the Fernald project. The project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in 2007. Deferred fees recognized in revenue in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $36.8 million, $21.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Also contributing to the increase in segment assets was a significant increase in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to projects performed in the Middle East. Global Services The Global Services segment had revenues of $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 16 percent growth during 2004 was primarily the result of increased operations and maintenance activity. The 15 percent increase in revenue in 2003 includes $151.6 million from Plant Performance Services (P2S), which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of that year. Revenue during 2002 also reflects the impact of selectivity to improve margins and depressed economic conditions resulting in lower operations and maintenance activity in the manufacturing sector during that year. 27 Table of Contents Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 7.8 percent, 8.7 percent and 9.7 percent 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The declines during 2004 and 2003 were the combined result of lower levels of company wide construction activity, which impacted the segments construction equipment business, and reduced margins that resulted from competitive factors in the operations and maintenance business. New awards in the Global Services segment for operations and maintenance projects increased 23 percent, to $1.5 billion during 2004, compared to $1.3 billion during 2003. A significant multi year contract for a new client in the United Kingdom was awarded during the fourth quarter of 2004. New awards for 2003 of $1.3 billion represented an increase of 23 percent over 2002. This increase is primarily due to the contribution from P2S, as well as a lower level of new awards in 2002 that was attributable to increased selectivity and the depressed economic conditions in the manufacturing sector. Backlog for the Global Services segment increased by 24 percent, to $2.3 billion, at December 31, 2004, compared with $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003. This growth was principally the result of the large new award discussed in the preceding paragraph. In previous years, backlog was fairly stable at $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2002. This relative stability is due in part to the multi year nature of operations and maintenance contracts where consistent and efficient performance results in long term client relationships. The equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. Power The Power segment has experienced significant declines in revenue during recent years, to $326 million during 2004 from $759 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $2.2 billion in 2002. This decline is due to the substantial work off of projects in backlog that were awarded in prior years. The segment has experienced a substantial reduction in new awards over the last several years as demand for new power generation has diminished following a strong cycle of power plant construction activity. As a result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor, commencing in the third quarter of 2004, its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment rather than the Power segment where it was previously reported. Operating profit margin in the Power segment declined to 4.2 percent during 2004 from a very strong 10.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003. The current year performance was negatively impacted by the completion of a major cycle of investment in power projects and unexpected costs associated with the start up and commissioning of a waste coal power plant during the third quarter of the year. Operating profit margin during 2002 was 4.9 percent. Although operating profit declined in 2003 to $77 million compared to $107 million in 2002 due to the decline in the power market, the strong margin performance in 2003 was attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of projects. Projects in the Power segment are primarily bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. New awards in the Power segment recovered somewhat during 2004, to $612 million from $485 million for 2003. Two awards during the fourth quarter 2004 were the largest contributors to this growth. One was for the recommissioning of a power plant in South Africa and the other was for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in Nevada. New awards declined to $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $1.1 billion in 2002. Backlog for the Power segment decreased to $552 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $605 million at December 31, 2003 and $841 million at December 31, 2002. The 2004 decline includes the impact of the movement of ICA Fluor to the Oil Gas segment. Most of the projects awarded in prior years have now been completed. New award activity for the near term future is expected to be modest as existing power generation capacity is expected to meet anticipated demand. Corporate For the year ended December 31, 2004 corporate administrative and general expenses were $142.4 million, compared with $141.5 million in the prior year. Included in the 2004 amount are non operating pretax gains of $5.5 million related to the final disposal of a residual interest in a property that was sold by the company in 1985 and $7.1 million from real estate sales. Those real estate gains, in addition to savings from successful expense reduction programs and favorable pension adjustments, were offset by higher executive incentives and costs of complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Corporate administrative and general expense, excluding non operating items, increased four percent in 2003 28 Table of Contents compared with 2002 primarily due to higher management incentive compensation costs. Non operating items in 2002 included charges relating to the reevaluation of the companys enterprise resource management (ERM) system, recognition of a provision for a guarantee obligation and a provision to recognize impairment related to an investment in The Beacon Group Energy Investment Fund, L.P. that were recognized in that year. Partially offsetting these charges in 2002 was the recognition of a gain relating to the demutualization of an insurance company in which the company had an investment. During 2002 significant cost reductions were realized as a result of the companys reevaluation of the scope of implementation and deployment of its ERM system (formerly known as Knowledge@Work). As part of this reevaluation effort the company altered the original ERM implementation plan and recognized a charge of $13.0 million in 2002 for abandonment of certain system functionality and to adjust depreciation expense. This charge partially offset the impact of the cost reductions realized upon changing the implementation and deployment plan. Net interest income was $3.5 million, $3.2 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Lower net interest income in 2004 and 2003 compared with 2002 is primarily the result of lower cash balances and increased short term borrowings. The effective tax rates on the companys continuing operations were 33.6 percent, 33.0 percent and 34.8 percent for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The slight rise in the tax rate in 2004 compared with 2003 is primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses as well as capital and foreign losses that received no tax benefits. Such increase, however, was partially offset by the decrease in state income taxes largely attributable to the utilization of prior year net operating losses in California, which losses were suspended in 2003 and 2002 due to the states deficit position. In addition, during 2004 the company disposed of certain business assets, which resulted in a favorable effective tax rate variance due to certain permanent book/tax basis differences. The tax rate in 2003 compared with 2002 was lower substantially due to the tax benefits from favorable tax return adjustments and settlements. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the Act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales that is viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the European Union. The company expects the net effect of the phase out of the ETI and the phase in of this new deduction to result in an increase in its effective tax rate for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 of approximately one to two percentage points, based on anticipated earnings levels. In the long term, the company does not expect to receive significant tax benefits from this new qualified domestic production deduction due to a shift of project mix to more international projects. Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the Act, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in FASB Statement No. 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the companys tax return. Also included in the Act is a provision that incentivizes U.S. multinationals to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing a special one time 85 percent dividend received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment and repatriation guidelines and certain limitations. The company may elect to apply this provision in 2005 and is in the process of evaluating its effect on the company, taking into account its reinvestment options and its operational working capital needs worldwide. The amount of the qualified dividend to be repatriated under this provision is yet to be determined, pending the completion of this evaluation, the passage of the Technical Corrections Bill by Congress and the issuance of additional guidance by the United States Department of the Treasury. 29 Table of Contents Matters in Dispute Resolution During 2004, several matters relating to certain significant completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of these matters: Murrin Murrin On May 5, 2004, Fluor Australia and its client, Anaconda Nickel (Anaconda) entered into a settlement agreement resolving all disputes related to the Murrin Murrin Nickel Cobalt project located in Western Australia. Fluor Australia paid the equivalent of approximately US$120 million to end all remaining claims under both the first and second phases of arbitration, including any appeals. The payment had no material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations as the amount, including defense costs, was funded by the companys insurers. In September 2002, the first phase of arbitration resulted in an amended award to Anaconda of approximately US$84.0 million and an award to Fluor Australia of approximately US$59.9 million for amounts owing from Anaconda under the contract. The company had previously recovered the first phase award plus substantially all defense costs incurred from available insurance. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. V. General Electric Company, et al U.S.D.C., Southern District Court, New York In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded and a decision on entitlement is expected shortly and a decision on damages is expected later in 2005. Dearborn Industrial Project Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan. The initial Turnkey Agreement, dated November 24, 1998, consisted of three phases. Commencing shortly after Notice to Proceed, the owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. The Project was severely delayed with completion of Phase II. DIG unilaterally took over completion and operation of Phase II and commissioned that portion of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit which Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute. D/FD retains lien rights (in fee) against the project. In October 2001, D/FD commenced an action in Michigan State Court to foreclose on the lien interest. In December 2001, DIG filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to D/FD claiming, among other things, that D/FD is liable to DIG for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the Dearborn plant. The court has ordered the matter to arbitration. The lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of D/FDs claims against DIG and DIGs claims against D/FD. An arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration is scheduled to begin in October 2005. Hamaca Crude Upgrader See discussion regarding the Hamaca project above under Oil Gas. 30 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and non EPCM components of its temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and completed as of the end of 2003. Operating results for these non core businesses have been reclassified and are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During 2003 the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of $31.9 million. In 2002, the sale of one dealership subsidiary resulted in cash proceeds of $45.9 million. Other dealership asset disposals during 2002 produced proceeds of $51 million. During the second quarter of 2002, the Australian operations of the temporary staffing business that was sold resulted in cash proceeds of $5.1 million. The temporary staffing industry experienced severe competition in 2002 due to depressed economic conditions, which resulted in significant erosion in the fair value of those businesses. As a result, the company recognized adjustments to the carrying value of the U.S. and U.K. based disposal groups. The sales of the U.S. and U.K. operations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, resulting in proceeds of $2 million. Disposal of the construction equipment operations in Argentina and Peru were finalized in 2002 resulting in proceeds of $5.1 million primarily from collection of accounts receivable and sales of inventory and equipment. Interest expense was not reclassified to discontinued operations in connection with the non core businesses because disposal of these operations did not include any debt to be assumed by the buyers. Revenue and the results of operations, including loss on disposal, for all discontinued operations are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 (in thousands) Revenues: Dealership operations $ 30,097 $ 155,909 Other equipment operations 7,880 Temporary staffing operations 34 67,661 Total revenues $ 30,131 $ 231,450 Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations: Dealership operations $ 2,575 $ 4,214 Other equipment operations 117 213 Temporary staffing operations (404 ) (4,036 ) Earnings from discontinued operations before tax 2,288 391 Provision for taxes 800 891 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,488 $ (500 ) Loss on disposal before tax $ (7,386 ) $ (8,770 ) Provision for taxes (tax benefit) 5,718 (2,909 ) Loss on disposal $ (13,104 ) $ (5,861 ) There have been no results of operations reported as discontinued operations for any period subsequent to June 30, 2003. The loss on disposal in all periods presented above is for impairment provisions to adjust the carrying value of the assets held for sale of the various individual non core businesses to fair value. Impairment provisions for the equipment operations included adjustments to the carrying value of equipment inventories, fixed assets and goodwill. Impairment provisions for the temporary staffing operations primarily included adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill. 31 Table of Contents Financial Position and Liquidity Cash utilized by operating activities in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to the significant use of cash to fund project operations. This compares to cash provided by operating activities in 2002. Significant cash was used in 2004, 2003 and 2002 to fund projects in the Power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of $44.5 million, $212.8 million and $282.1 million, respectively. These advances represented the companys proportional share of excess cash from Duke/Fluor Daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in 2001 and prior years upon award of projects. The joint venture partners managed excess cash of Duke/Fluor Daniel through these proportional advances. Client advances on Duke/Fluor Daniel projects have been a normal condition of contracts in the power industry where most of the projects are negotiated on a fixed price basis. As these projects progress, the expenditures for labor and materials are partially funded from these advance payments. With the completion of nearly all work on Duke/Fluor Daniel projects as of December 31, 2004, the amounts advanced to the company have been substantially repaid to the partnership and used in project execution. The company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation in July 2003, the decision to dissolve the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. The dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on future operating cash flows. The company also used significant cash in 2004 and 2003 to fund ongoing work and the change orders that are in the dispute resolution process relating to the Hamaca project in Venezuela. The company has incurred substantial costs relating to the change orders for which it is not currently being paid pending resolution through arbitration. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company had incurred $249.7 million and $179.6 million, respectively, in deferred costs on this project. During 2004 and 2003, ongoing work on Hamaca not associated with change orders used approximately $59 million and $80 million, respectively, of cash from advances received in prior years. Excluding the impact of the repayment of advances relating to power projects and the funding for the Hamaca project, cash was used to fund other changes in net operating assets and liabilities primarily associated with engineering and construction activities. There has also been a significant increase in operating assets and liabilities totaling approximately $56 million in 2004 and $126 million in 2003 relating to work in the Government segment, primarily in connection with start up and ongoing activities on the CETAC and AFCAP projects in the Middle East in 2004 and 2003, as well as the Missile Defense work in Alaska in 2003. The projects in the Middle East required rapid deployment starting late in the fourth quarter of 2003, which resulted in substantial initial investment of working capital. Reconstruction activity in Iraq during 2004 required additional working capital. Working capital of the Industrial Infrastructure segment increased by $108 million during 2004 due to the startup of several large projects in the latter part of the year. Early start up activities and ongoing progress on major Oil Gas projects other than Hamaca required investments in operating working capital of $83 million in 2003. During 2003, approximately $44 million of working capital was provided to P2S, which was acquired early in that year. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. Cash utilized by operating activities is also impacted by contributions to the companys defined benefit retirement plans. Contributions in 2004 amounted to $30 million compared with $52 million and $110 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The large contributions in 2003 and 2002 were due in part to lower than expected investment results on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan was not fully funded in 2004 and 2003 and the minimum pension liability amounts were $34 million and $28 million, respectively, for this plan. The company recognized a minimum liability plus elimination of $12 million of pension assets in 2002, resulting in an after tax charge of $29 million in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity. During 2003 and 2002, the receipt of funds from insurance claims relating to the Murrin Murrin project amounted to $84.1 million and $35.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, amounts due from the insurance companies for claims submitted had been collected except for minor amounts of arbitration defense costs. Activities in 2002 associated with the disposal of certain discontinued equipment and temporary staffing businesses generated $24 million of cash from liquidation of operating assets and liabilities, primarily from accounts receivable and inventories. Business acquisitions utilized cash of $33.0 million during 2004 (for the acquisition of Trend Western) and $54.5 million during 2003 (for the acquisition of Del Jen, P2S and J.A. Jones International). Cash flows from investing activities during 32 Table of Contents 2004 included $58.6 million from the sale of three excess real estate assets and a residual property interest and $22.2 million from the disposal of other property, plant and equipment. During 2003 the company realized $26.1 million from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and $31.9 million in proceeds from the sale of the last discontinued equipment dealership operation. Cash provided by investing activities in 2002 was benefited by the sale and liquidation activities associated with discontinued operations. Sales of discontinued businesses during that year generated $101 million in proceeds from the liquidation of property, plant and equipment and sales of dealership and temporary staffing businesses. Partially offsetting these proceeds were capital expenditures of $16 million primarily for the one remaining equipment dealership that was sold later in 2003. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002 included capital expenditures of $104.4 million, $79.2 million and $63.0 million, respectively, for continuing operations. Capital expenditures for continuing operations primarily relate to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures from 2003 to 2004 related largely to rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq. The decision to divest certain equipment operations substantially reduced the companys capital investment requirements. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, facility renewal and refurbishment, and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. In July 2004, the company entered into a new, five year, $800 million Senior Credit Facility. The agreement replaced existing facilities totaling $700 million. Of the total capacity, $300 million is dedicated to commercial paper back up lines. The balance is available for letters of credit and funded loans. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, primarily in response to significant increases in funds required for project operations, the company had outstanding borrowings of $129.9 million and $121.5 million, respectively, in the commercial paper market. Liquidity is further provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress, which, prior to 2004 included the companys proportional share of excess cash that was advanced to the company by Duke/Fluor Daniel (see discussion above). As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. Cash has also been required to fund work performed on the Hamaca project in Venezuela. This project incurred significant costs for work relating to change orders that are subject to arbitration proceedings. The increase in new awards over the last two years will continue to result in start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Over the next 12 months cash required to fund start up and ongoing project activities is expected to result in an increase in net operating assets and liabilities and may reduce available cash balances or require other sources of funding including additional short or long term borrowings or equity offerings. During 2004 the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off all outstanding commercial paper and $100.0 million was used to obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. In December 2004 the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. No securities have been issued under this filing. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains amounting to $40.0 million, $45.1 million and $20.9 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. 33 Table of Contents Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $61.7 million, $28.5 million and $14.9 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. No purchases were made during 2004. During 2003 and 2002, the company purchased 94,000 shares for total consideration of $2.7 million and 726,000 shares for total consideration of $19.2 million, respectively. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. There is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program. Cash dividends declared and paid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were at the rate of $0.64 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand, short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $825 million in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. In addition, the company has $52 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2004, the company had utilized $392 million of its letter of credit capacity. The company also posts surety bonds primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total Under 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Long term Debt: Convertible Senior Notes $ 330 $ $ $ $ 330 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Operating leases (1) 275 29 53 42 151 Compensation related obligations 296 30 67 82 117 Pollution control bonds 7 2 5 Total $ 926 $ 61 $ 125 $ 124 $ 616 (1) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other domestic and international locations. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2004. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the amount payable under a guarantee is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. 34 Table of Contents Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2004, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $4 million. The remaining outstanding amount of a financial guarantee for $7 million of pollution control bonds related to zinc operations that were sold in 1987 has been recognized at the full amount of the underlying obligation. The obligation was recognized by a charge to earnings in 2002 due to the obligors bankruptcy filing and inability to meet the current obligation on the bonds without financial assistance from the company. Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix costs at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. Debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon on all long term debt. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on its long term debt is not material due to the low fixed interest rates on the obligations. However, commercial paper is issued at current short term interest rates, which could increase in the future. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2004, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 27 months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2004 was $54 million. Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. Most of these unrealized gains relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held, the risk of realized translation losses is mitigated. In 2001, the company issued a warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares, at $36.06 per share, of the companys common stock to a partner in the companys e commerce procurement venture. Any compensation realized by the holder through exercise of the warrant will offset any royalties otherwise payable under a five year cooperation and services agreement.
