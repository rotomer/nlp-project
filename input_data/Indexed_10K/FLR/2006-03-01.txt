Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non operating income and expense items; earnings or loss from discontinued operations; and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results During 2005, revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by 40 percent and 22 percent, respectively, compared with 2004. All of the companys business segments had higher revenue primarily due to increased project execution activity resulting from strong new award levels over the last three years. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years. The Oil Gas and Global Services segments are benefiting from this trend through improved revenue and operating profit. Also contributing to results in the Oil Gas segment was the completion of a major refinery upgrader project in Venezuela and final settlement of all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the project. This performance was, however, partially offset by an operating loss in the Industrial Infrastructure segment primarily due to settlements related to projects in the dispute resolution process and cost overruns on several projects. Revenue improved in the Government segment due to higher activity in Iraq and for support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in hurricane relief efforts; however, operating profit was essentially flat primarily due to cost overruns and recognized losses on certain embassy projects for the Department of State. The Industrial Infrastructure segment recognized losses in 2005 on various project related settlements, including two resort hotel projects in the Caribbean and two life sciences projects. In addition, a toll road project being executed by a joint venture in which the company has 50 percent participation, recognized losses in 2005 due to further increases in estimated costs. A loss was also recognized in 2004 on this project. The toll road project has experienced increased costs associated with scope changes requested by the client and other delay related costs. All of these projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of certain variances in cost estimates remain with the company. During 2004, revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with 2003. The 2004 improvement in revenue was concentrated in the Oil Gas, Government and Global Services segments. All segments, with the exception of Power, had increases in operating profit in 2004 compared with 2003. Revenue and operating profit in the Power segment were substantially lower in 2004 compared with 2003 due to the decline in new awards due to the cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction and resulting project completions. The Government segment benefited from increased revenue beginning in the first quarter of 2004 from business acquisitions completed in 2003 and early 2004. During 2005 the company recognized an accrual in the amount of $19.1 million for foreign employment related taxes that may be payable primarily on behalf of certain United States expatriate employees working in certain foreign jurisdictions. The employment taxes primarily relate to stock based compensation where local tax reporting requirements differ in the method of calculation of taxable amounts from the reporting required in the United States. The accrual recognizes the aggregate of taxes due on compensation as required to be reported in these foreign jurisdictions. Approximately $15.3 million of the charge was recognized in the Oil Gas segment with the majority of the balance recognized in Industrial Infrastructure and minor amounts in the Government and Global Services segments. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes for the three years ended December 31, 2005 were $300 million in 2005, $281 million in 2004 and $268 million in 2003. Because of the decline in Power segment earnings, 22 Table of Contents which related largely to projects located in the United States, domestic operating profit has continued to decline during 2005 and 2004, offset by increases in operating profits from non U.S. operations. The decrease in the 2005 tax rate compared with 2004 is primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefit associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. The company had net earnings of $2.62 per share in 2005 compared with $2.25 per share in 2004 and $1.95 per share in 2003. Results in 2003 were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of $0.15 per share and a loss of $0.13 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results of discontinued operations are further discussed below. The loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relates to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) relating to consolidation of entities that owned certain of the companys leased facilities. Additional discussion of these facilities is contained in the Financing Obligations footnote in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see Segment Operations and Corporate and Tax Matters below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts. Engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor costs and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract costs and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2005, 68 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while 32 percent was for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees, as well as increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues realized from the projects. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $144 million and $105 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. 23 Table of Contents Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and costs, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures. Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues, costs and operating profits in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the Oil Gas, Industrial Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R) provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards. Foreign Currency. The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. The company does not engage in currency speculation. 24 Table of Contents Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2005 the company had deferred tax assets of $323.7 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $40.9 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $55.8 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Retirement Benefits. The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. The continuing trend in recent years of low long term interest rates has had the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $35 million and $70 million for the calendar year 2006. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $29 million. Share Based Payment. The company uses stock based compensation to reward key executives and align their interests with those of shareholders. Types of stock based compensation that have been awarded in recent years include restricted stock, options and stock appreciation rights. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Upon adoption of SFAS 123 R, pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer permitted. The provisions of SFAS 123 R apply to awards granted after the required effective date of the statement, which is no later than January 1, 2006 for the company. Initial application to existing unvested stock option awards may be based on either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method. The method of application selected by the company will determine which, if any, previously reported operating results will be restated. As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to APB 25 and, as such, recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123 Rs fair value method will have an impact on results of operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123 R will not be material based on unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2005. Had SFAS 123 R been adopted in prior periods, the impact would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of the new standard will also have an impact on the timing of expense recognition for new stock based awards, as discussed in the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123 R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This requirement will generally impact cash provided or utilized by operating activities with equal offset in cash flows from financing activities in 25 Table of Contents periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amounts of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were $17 million, $14 million and $4 million in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance (EPCM) and is organized into five business segments: Oil Gas, Industrial Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil Gas segment provides engineering, procurement and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial Infrastructure segment provides engineering, procurement and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities, commercial and institutional buildings, mining, microelectronics, telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities. The Government segment provides project management, engineering, construction, and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, construction equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services. The Power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities. Oil Gas. In the first quarter of 2005, the chemicals business line, which had been part of the Industrial Infrastructure segment, was realigned under the Oil Gas segment. This change was made to better match the needs for the large number of petrochemical projects anticipated over the next few years with the Oil Gas segments large project support infrastructure. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. Commencing in the third quarter of 2004, as the result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor Daniel (ICA Fluor), its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment. ICA Fluor was previously included in the Power segment. Prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ICA Fluor. Revenue in the Oil Gas segment amounted to $5.3 billion, $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 54 percent increase during 2005 and 26 percent increase during 2004 resulted from the strength of new contract awards over the past several years due to the higher level of global oil and gas exploration and refining, and also included $294 million in 2005 from the Hamaca project settlement discussed further below. Operating profit margin in the Oil Gas segment was 4.6 percent in 2005 compared with 4.7 percent in 2004 and 4.4 percent in 2003. Although 2005 operating margin was favorably impacted by the $30.5 million settlement discussed in the following paragraph, margin was reduced by the impact of the $15.3 million employment tax charge discussed above under Summary of Overall Company Results. During the third quarter of 2005, the company settled all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project in Jose, Venezuela. The pending arbitration proceedings have been dismissed. The settlement reimbursed the company for its incurred costs arising from change orders on the project and for its cost of capital in funding those incurred costs. The settlement was recorded in revenue and resulted in recognition of $30.5 million in operating profit in the Oil Gas segment. New awards in the Oil Gas segment were $4.4 billion in 2005, $4.0 billion in 2004 and $4.1 billion in 2003. The segment is participating in an expanding market that includes very large mega projects in diverse geographical locations, which are very well suited for Fluors global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. New project awards in 2005 included $1.3 billion for two large international petrochemical projects, $1.0 billion for a gas complex in the United Arab Emirates and $774 million from a Canadian oil sands project. New project awards in 2004 included a $570 million oil sands project and a $244 million clean fuels project, which are both in Canada, a $346 million refinery complex modernization project in Mexico and a $176 million refinery upgrade project in South Africa. New project awards in 2003 include the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project, a major oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. Backlog for the Oil Gas segment was $6.0 billion, up sequentially from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2004 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2003. The 2005 growth relates principally to the continued strength of new awards and 26 Table of Contents project scope adjustments to existing projects. The 2004 backlog growth included the impacts of new awards and the reclassification of ICA Fluor during the year. Total assets in the Oil Gas segment decreased to $575 million at December 31, 2005 from $731 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting the net impact of the settlement on the Hamaca project, partially offset by additional costs associated with the higher level of project execution activities. Total assets in the Oil Gas segment were $523 million at December 31, 2003. The 2004 increase includes the impact of the growth in segment revenues, as well as incurred costs that were deferred on the Hamaca project of $70 million. Industrial Infrastructure. As mentioned above, in the first quarter of 2005, the chemicals business line, which had been part of the Industrial Infrastructure segment, was realigned under the Oil Gas segment. Again, this change was made to better match the needs for the large number of petrochemical projects anticipated over the next few years with the Oil Gas segments large project support infrastructure. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. The Industrial Infrastructure segment had revenues of $3.2 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues increased significantly during 2005, primarily as the result of the strength of 2004 contract awards. The 18 percent decline in revenues during 2004 resulted from slow start up progress on recently awarded projects and a lower level of new awards in the latter half of 2003. In addition, certain projects that were removed from backlog in 2003 also had a negative impact on the volume of work performed in 2004. The Industrial Infrastructure segment reported an operating loss of $16.7 million for 2005, compared with operating profits of $62.4 million and $63.1 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by provisions relating to specific projects. During 2005, a $32.1 million charge relating to the no liability resolution of a Cayman Islands project was recorded. On June 23, 2005, Fluor Daniel Caribbean, Inc. (FD Caribbean), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, received an unfavorable jury verdict awarding $28.8 million to the developer of a resort hotel project in the Caribbean. FD Caribbean was the general contractor on the project, which is located in the Cayman Islands. As a consequence, the company recorded a $65 million charge in its second quarter to recognize the jury award, estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest, and reversal of previously billed accounts receivable for work performed on the project. At the time of the original jury decision, the company strongly believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or by applicable law. On September 15, 2005, the judge who tried the case granted the companys motion for a new trial, setting aside the unfavorable verdict in its totality. On September 29, 2005, in lieu of a new trial, the parties stipulated to a judgment of no liability in favor of either side, and the action was dismissed with prejudice. As a result, the company reversed the provision for the jury award, estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest in the third quarter of 2005. The company participates in a 50/50 joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. The project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, and additional labor, resulting in additional costs due to schedule delays. The company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project costs, as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project. During 2005 and 2004, provisions of $24 million and $28 million, respectively, were recorded due to these increasing estimated costs. While the estimate of total project costs is based on the final design including changes directed by the client, any future changes in these estimates will be recognized when identified. To date, the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately $112 million to the client. Costs totaling $28.7 million have been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of December 31, 2005 and the company has recognized its $14.4 million proportionate share of these costs in revenue. In addition to charges arising from the Cayman Islands and transportation infrastructure projects discussed above, during 2005 the segment recorded provisions totaling approximately $50 million relating to a number of other projects that have been the subject of dispute resolution activities. Project losses recognized in 2005 include settlements on a resort hotel project in the Bahamas and two life sciences projects. These projects were bid under 27 Table of Contents fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company. Where the company had determined that costs incurred in excess of the contract price should be the responsibility of the owner, the company made claims against the owners for recovery of costs incurred. Dispute resolution activities have now been concluded on these matters and settlements have been finalized. Several other matters of lesser significance were concluded and incurred costs deemed to be unrecoverable including certain legal fees were recognized in 2005. During 2004, operating profit included the recorded provision for the transportation infrastructure project discussed above and a $7.2 million positive impact from a recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the Verde Gold project. In 2003, operating profit was negatively impacted by a $7.4 million charge relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in Australia. The company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its London Connect Project (LUL), a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the London Underground system. In February 2005, the company sought relief through arbitration proceedings for two issues. First, the company is seeking relief for the overall delay and disruption to the project that relates to the contract time period of 2001 through 2003. The arbitration hearing on this matter is scheduled to commence in May 2006. In addition, a claim for delay and disruption subsequent to 2003 will be submitted to the dispute resolution process shortly. The total costs incurred amounting to $44 million relating to delay and disruption for the entire contract period have been recognized as claims. The second issue concerns the responsibility for enabling the various train stock to accept the new telecommunication network equipment. Hearings involving LUL, the company and Motorola, a subcontractor, are completed and the parties await the arbitration award. New awards in the Industrial Infrastructure segment were $2.3 billion during 2005, following a very strong level of $4.6 billion in 2004 and $2.2 billion during 2003. The lower level of new awards in 2005 includes the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards. New awards in 2004 included a variety of mining, life sciences and manufacturing projects throughout the world. Backlog for the Industrial Infrastructure segment declined to $3.9 billion at the end of 2005 from $5.1 billion at the end of 2004. For 2003, ending backlog was $2.9 billion. The 2005 decline includes the impact of the lower level of new awards during the year and reductions relating primarily to the cancellations of a number of life sciences projects. The growth during 2004 was reflective of the substantial new awards during the year. Government. The Government segment had revenues of $2.7 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 19 percent increase in revenue during 2005 resulted principally from FEMA contracts associated with hurricane relief efforts in certain states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and an increase in reconstruction activity in Iraq. The 34 percent increase in revenue during 2004 resulted principally from reconstruction activity in Iraq, strong performance on environmental remediation programs for the Department of Energy (DOE), and approximately $220 million from businesses acquired in 2004 and 2003. Del Jen, Inc. (Del Jen) was acquired late in the first quarter of 2003 and J.A. Jones was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, Trend Western was acquired by Del Jen in the first quarter of 2004. Revenue in all three years includes work for ongoing environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project (Fernald) in Ohio and the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. The operating profit for the Government segment during 2005 of $83.7 million, or 3 percent of revenues, was essentially unchanged compared with 2004. Although 2005 operating profit increased due to the years revenue growth, that improvement was offset by a $5 million charge related to the settlement of a civil lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice and provisions totaling $56 million recognized on four embassy projects. These embassy projects have been adversely impacted by higher costs due to scope changes, unexpected execution problems, increases in material cost and subcontractor difficulties. The company has 11 embassy projects that are in various stages of completion under contracts with the United States Department of State. Claims for equitable adjustment on seven of these projects totaling approximately $77.5 million have been identified to date and as of December 31, 2005, $44.3 million in costs relating to these claims have been incurred and recognized in revenue. Additional claim recoveries continue to be evaluated. 28 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2004, operating profit of $83.5 million, or 3.7 percent of revenue, compares with $48.1 million, or 2.8 percent of revenue, during 2003. The earnings growth resulted from strong performance on environmental nuclear projects and from the full year effect of the Del Jen and Trend Western acquisitions. New awards in the Government segment were $2.5 billion during 2005, compared with $2.3 billion during 2004 and $2.0 billion in 2003. During the past two years new awards have increased due to new FEMA contracts, reconstruction activities in Iraq and business acquisitions. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months for annually funded contracts. Backlog has remained fairly constant over the past three years, at $1.4 billion for 2005 and $1.5 billion for 2004 and 2003. Total assets in the Government segment increased to $905 million at December 31, 2005, up from $654 million at December 31, 2004 and $475 million at December 31, 2003. The 2005 increase was the combined result of significant increases in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to FEMA and Iraq reconstruction projects, the embassy claims, and unbilled fees on the Fernald project. The 2004 increase related principally to Iraq reconstruction projects and unbilled fees on the Fernald project. The segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling $130 million related to the Fernald project. The project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in 2006. Deferred fees recognized in revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $38.9 million, $36.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively. Global Services. The Global Services segment had revenues of $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Increased operations and maintenance and equipment rental activities have been the primary drivers of these increases. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 7.2 percent, 7.8 percent and 8.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. The small decline during 2005 resulted from a shift in the mix of business among the segments various service lines. The 2004 decline was the result of lower levels of self perform construction activity and reduced margins resulting from competitive factors in the operations and maintenance business. The equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. New awards in the Global Services segment increased 42 percent, to $2.2 billion during 2005, and 23 percent, to $1.5 billion during 2004, from $1.3 billion during 2003. Continued growth in the number of client sites served gave rise to these increases. During 2005, backlog for the Global Services segment increased by 9 percent, to $2.5 billion, from $2.3 billion at the end of 2004. Backlog increased 24 percent during 2004, from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003. This growth was principally the result of the increase in new awards discussed in the preceding paragraph, although a change in scope on a large maintenance contract resulted in the removal of $400 million in materials costs from backlog during 2005. Total assets in the Global Services segment increased to $640 million at December 31, 2005, up from $463 million at December 31, 2004 and $384 million at December 31, 2003. These increases were the combined result of significant increases in capital expenditures, accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to hurricane relief projects and equipment rentals associated with Iraq reconstruction contracts. Power. In July 2003, the company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation the decision to terminate the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership (D/FD) as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. The dissolution was substantially completed in 2005 and did not have a material impact on results of 29 Table of Contents operations or financial position of the company. The Power segment continues to identify and pursue power generation opportunities with its own resources. Commencing in the third quarter of 2004, as the result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor, its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment rather than the Power segment where it was previously reported. Prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ICA Fluor. The Power segment has reported significantly lower revenue in 2005 and 2004, of $384 million and $326 million, respectively, than during 2003, when $759 million was reported. This decline resulted from the reduced level of construction of new power plants discussed above. Operating profit margin in the Power segment declined to 3.5 percent during 2005 from 4.2 percent during 2004. The 2005 margin reflects the negative impact of a loss on one project, partly offset by favorable performance on a number of other projects. The 2004 margin reflects performance on projects that were either completed or nearing completion, where profit recognition is strongest and a favorable settlement for a dispute relating to a project that was completed in 2002. The favorable results were partly offset by unexpected costs associated with a waste coal power plant start up and commissioning. Operating margin during 2003 was a very strong 10.2 percent, which was attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of a number of projects. Projects in the Power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution, but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. New awards in the Power segment recovered due to a modest strengthening in the power generation market during 2005 and 2004. New awards were to $1.0 billion in 2005 and $612 million in 2004, compared with $485 million during 2003. New awards in 2005 included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in Kentucky and a 2000 megawatt power plant in Nevada. New awards in 2004 included one for the recommissioning of a power plant in South Africa and a contract for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in Nevada. Backlog for the Power segment increased to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 from $552 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting the new awards in 2005. During 2004, backlog declined from $605 million at December 31, 2003, which included the impact of the movement of ICA Fluor to the Oil Gas segment. Corporate and Tax Matters Corporate. For the three years ended December 31, 2005, corporate administrative and general expenses were $143.7 million, $142.4 million and $141.5 million, respectively. Included in these amounts is non operating income of $11 million, $9 million and $1 million, respectively. The 2005 and 2004 amounts relate primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties in both years and a gain from disposal of a residual property interest in 2004. Corporate administrative and general expense, excluding non operating items, increased two percent in 2005 and six percent in 2004. The factors that impacted the 2004 expense level continued in 2005, and additional expenses were incurred with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters, as discussed below. The 2004 increase was the net result of savings from successful expense reduction programs and favorable pension adjustments, offset by higher executive incentives and costs of complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. On May 10, 2005, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from Southern California to the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. This move is expected to improve operational efficiency and position the company to more effectively serve its global client base. Of the approximately 390 headquarters staff located in Aliso Viejo, California on May 10, 2005, approximately 200 employees will either stay in Southern California or move to other U.S. office locations. Approximately 80 employees from Southern California and other company locations will relocate to the new Texas headquarters where approximately 100 additional employees are expected to be hired. Approximately 130 employees will leave the company as a result of the move. 30 Table of Contents The cost of employee displacements is being accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of 2005 through the anticipated date of the Southern California headquarters office closure in the second quarter of 2006. All other relocation and hiring costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2005, corporate administrative expenses include $5.7 million for relocation costs, which comprises the accrual of employee displacement costs and other direct expenses. Additional employee relocation and hiring costs and facility relocation costs totaling approximately $19 million are expected to be incurred during 2006, which will also be included in corporate administrative and general expense. The existing corporate facility in Aliso Viejo was sold in September 2005. A short term, market rate lease back has been negotiated with the buyer that will allow the company to continue to occupy the facility for up to 18 months. The cost of the new Texas headquarters is expected to approximate $60 million and will be paid from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the current headquarters facility. Net interest income was $7.4 million, $3.5 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Higher interest income in 2005 relates principally to larger investment balances and higher short term interest rates. Tax. The effective tax rates on the companys continuing operations were 24.1 percent, 33.6 percent and 33.0 percent for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the 2005 tax rate compared with 2004 is primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefit associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) as more fully discussed below, and the reversal of certain valuation allowance resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. These aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely. During 2005, the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan. Accordingly, the 2005 tax rate reflects the U.S. tax effect on these earnings. The slight rise in the tax rate in 2004 compared with 2003 is primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses. Such increase, however, was partially offset by the reversal of certain valuation allowances arising from the utilization of certain tax credit carryforward, and the decrease in state income taxes largely attributable to the utilization of prior year net operating losses in California, which losses were suspended in 2003 and 2002 due to the states deficit position. In addition, during 2004 the company disposed of certain business assets, which resulted in a favorable effective tax rate variance due to certain permanent book/tax basis differences. On October 22, 2004, the Jobs Act was signed into law. Among its various provisions, the Jobs Act creates a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations. On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 2 allows companies additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the Jobs Act was enacted to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on a companys plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings for the purpose of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. On August 11, 2005, the companys Domestic Reinvestment Plan (the Plan) prepared pursuant to the Jobs Act was approved by the companys Chief Executive Officer. The Plan was ratified by the Executive Committee of the companys Board of Directors on August 29, 2005. On September 29, 2005, approximately $89 million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company, including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the Jobs Act. The results of operations for 2005 include a tax benefit of $3.8 million attributable to the dividends received deduction net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction. Note that this 31 Table of Contents tax benefit decreased slightly from $4.1 million reported in the third quarter due to a true up of the 2005 operating results in the fourth quarter. Discontinued Operations In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and non EPCM components of its temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and completed as of the end of the second quarter of 2003. During 2003 the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of $31.9 million. Revenue, earnings and loss on disposal for discontinued operations during 2003 were $30.1 million, $1.5 million and $13.1 million, respectively. There have been no results of operations reported as discontinued operations for any period subsequent to June 30, 2003. Matters in Dispute Resolution As of December 31, 2005, a number of matters relating to certain significant completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of certain of these matters: Infrastructure Joint Venture Project Discussion of the status of an infrastructure joint venture project in California is included above under Industrial Infrastructure. London Connect Project Discussion of the status of the London Connect project is included above under Industrial Infrastructure. Embassy Projects Discussion of the status of these projects is included above under Government. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. V. General Electric Company, et al U.S.D.C., Southern District Court, New York In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the engineering, procurement and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded. In January 2005 the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases; the first to be a decision on entitlement and second, a decision on damages. On May 4, 2005 the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed Fluors entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for costs incurred in construction of the plant. A decision determining the amount recoverable has yet to be issued by the arbitration panel. Dearborn Industrial Project Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan. The initial Turnkey Agreement, dated November 24, 1998, consisted of three phases. Commencing shortly after Notice to Proceed, the owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. 32 Table of Contents The Project was severely delayed with completion of Phase II. DIG unilaterally took over completion and operation of Phase II and commissioned that portion of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit which Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute. D/FD retains lien rights (in fee) against the project. In October 2001, D/FD commenced an action in Michigan State Court to foreclose on the lien interest. In December 2001, DIG filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to D/FD claiming, among other things, that D/FD is liable to DIG for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the Dearborn plant. The court has ordered the matter to arbitration. The lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of D/FDs claims against DIG and DIGs claims against D/FD. An arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration is underway. Financial Position and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities during 2005 was $409 million of which $245 million was provided by reductions in net operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to cash collected in connection with the close out of the Hamaca project. The company used significant cash in 2004 and 2003 to fund ongoing work and change orders relating to the Hamaca project. In both 2004 and 2003, net operating assets and liabilities increased by amounts greater than funds generated by other earnings sources resulting in cash being utilized by operating activities. Significant cash was used in 2004 and 2003 to fund projects in the Power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of $45 million and $213 million, respectively. These advances represented the companys proportional share of excess cash from Duke/Fluor Daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in prior years upon award of projects. With the completion of nearly all work on Duke/Fluor Daniel projects as of the end of 2004, the amounts advanced to the company had been substantially repaid to the partnership and used in project execution. The company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation in 2003, the decision to dissolve the partnership. The dissolution was largely completed in 2005 with no significant impact on cash flows. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. The increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress, which prior to 2004 included the companys proportional share of excess cash that was advanced to the company by Duke/Fluor Daniel. As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. In the event there is net investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. While contributions to defined contribution plans have remained relatively stable over the past three years, contributions to the defined benefit plans have shown more variability, at $89 million in 2005 compared with $30 million in 2004 and $52 million in 2003. The large contributions in 2005 and 2003 were due in part to the variability of actual returns on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan that was not fully funded in 2004 and 2003 received a contribution totaling $60 million which provides full funding to the level of accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 all plans are funded to at least the level of accumulated benefits. During 2003, the receipt of funds from insurance claims relating to the Murrin Murrin project amounted to $84.1 million. As of December 31, 2005, amounts due from the insurance companies for claims submitted have been collected except for minor amounts of arbitration defense costs. Business acquisitions utilized cash of $33.0 million during 2004 (for the acquisition of Trend Western) and $54.5 million during 2003 (for the acquisition of Del Jen, P2S and J.A. Jones International). Cash flows from 33 Table of Contents investing activities during 2005 and 2004 included $45.0 million and $58.6 million from the sale of real estate assets and a residual property interest and $24.7 million and $22.2 million, respectively from the disposal of other property, plant and equipment. During 2003 the company realized $26.1 million from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and $31.9 million in proceeds from the sale of the last discontinued equipment dealership operation. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included capital expenditures of $213.2 million, $104.4 million and $79.0 million, respectively, for continuing operations. Capital expenditures for continuing operations include $23.9 million in 2005 for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in Texas, but otherwise relate primarily relate to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures over the past three years related largely to rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq in all years and hurricane recovery in the United States during 2005. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, completion of the new headquarters facility and renewal and refurbishment of other facilities, and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. New engineering and construction joint ventures of the Industrial and Infrastructure segment in the United Kingdom during 2005 required capital contributions totaling approximately $30 million. In July 2004, the company entered into a new, five year, $800 million Senior Credit Facility. The agreement replaced existing facilities totaling $700 million. Of the total capacity, $300 million is dedicated to commercial paper back up lines. The balance is available for letters of credit and funded loans. As of December 31, 2004, primarily in response to significant increases in funds required for project operations, the company had outstanding borrowings of $129.9 million in the commercial paper market. These borrowings were repaid during 2005. During 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off all outstanding commercial paper and $100.0 million was used to obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash if a specified trading price of the companys common stock (the trigger price) is achieved and maintained for a specified period and the Notes are presented by the holders for conversion. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the trigger price was achieved for the specified number of days and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2005. The company does not know the amount, if any, of the Notes that will be presented for conversion, and will use available cash balances to satisfy any required repayments. In December 2004, the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. The company has entered into a distribution agreement for up to two million shares of common stock. During 2005 the company sold 758,367 shares under this distribution agreement, realizing net proceeds of $41.8 million. During 2005, an equity bridge loan and non recourse project financing provided $16.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively, of financing cash flow. These amounts relate to the consolidation of a joint venture, as discussed in National Roads Telecommunications Services Project below. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $50.6 million, $61.7 million and $28.5 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. No purchases were made during 2005 or 2004. During 2003, the company purchased 94,000 shares for total consideration of $2.7 million. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. There is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program. Cash dividends declared in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were at the rate of $0.64 per share. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. However, for the dividend paid to shareholders as of January 3, 2006, payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of 34 Table of Contents December 2005, resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the dividend payable April 3, 2006 to $0.20 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. This trend reversed during 2005 and unrealized translation losses occurred. Unrealized losses of $32.9 million in 2005 and unrealized gains of $40.0 million and $45.1 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand, short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (including contractual obligations). The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $976 million in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. In addition, the company has $61 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2005, the company had utilized $542 million of its letter of credit capacity. The company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms, primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 330 $ 330 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 17 17 4.65% equity bridge loan 17 17 Non recourse project finance debt 58 34 24 Operating leases (1) 248 27 49 38 134 Compensation related obligations 311 26 66 68 151 Guarantee of pollution control bonds 5 3 2 Total $ 986 $ 386 $ 168 $ 130 $ 302 (1) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other domestic and international locations. The company has a joint venture arrangement that will design, build, finance and maintain an aircraft refueling facility at a United States Air Force base in Qatar for the Defense Energy Support Center, an agency of the Department of Defense. The company has a 27.5 percent interest in the joint venture company. On April 29, 2005, the joint venture entered into an agreement for project financing which includes a joint and several project completion guarantee by the members of the joint venture. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required under the guarantee is $76.5 million, the maximum principal amount available under the financing arrangement, plus any accrued interest. The facility is presently over 50 percent complete and proceeding as expected. 35 Table of Contents National Roads Telecommunications Services (NRTS) Project During 2005 the companys Industrial Infrastructure segment was awarded a $544 million project by a joint venture, GeneSYS Telecommunications Limited (GeneSYS), which is consolidated in the companys consolidated financial statements. The project was entered into with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport (the Highways Agency) to design, build, maintain and finance a new integrated transmission network throughout Englands motorways. The project will be executed by GeneSYS in which the company owns a 45 percent interest and HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited, which owns a 55 percent interest. GeneSYS will finance the engineering and construction (EC) of upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately $240 million (140 million) of non recourse debt (the term loan facility) from a consortium of lenders (the Banks) along with joint venture member capital contributions totaling approximately $37 million (22 million). The equity contributions by the joint venture members have been provided through equity bridge loans from the Banks. The loans have been guaranteed or secured in proportion to each members equity participation. The equity bridge loans are repayable upon completion of the upgrade at which time the equity members are required to fund their contributions to the joint venture. During construction, the availability of the existing telecommunications network will be maintained for the Highways Agency by GeneSYS. Upon completion of the upgrade, operating availability of the network will be provided to the Highways Agency and the system will be fully maintained by GeneSYS. Under this arrangement, GeneSYS is entitled to payments from the Highways Agency for network availability, operations and maintenance (OM) plus fees for on demand maintenance services. The company has been engaged by GeneSYS to provide design engineering and construction of the network as well as OM and on demand services for the existing and upgraded facilities under a subcontract extending through 2016. Based on a qualitative analysis of the operations of GeneSYS and the variable interests of all parties to the arrangement, under the provisions of FIN 46 R the company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The companys December 31, 2005 financial statements include the accounts of GeneSYS, and, accordingly, the nonrecourse debt provided by the Banks. The term loan facility provides for interest only at LIBOR plus a margin of 95 basis points during construction of the upgraded facilities reducing to a margin of 90 basis points after completion of construction and continuing until fully repaid. Commitment fees are payable on unused portions of the facility. Payments are due in installments over the term of the services period ending in 2016. The term loan facility is an obligation of GeneSYS and will never be a debt obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. Accordingly, in the event of a default on the term loans, the lenders may only look to the resources of GeneSYS for repayment. The debt will never be repayable from assets of the company beyond its gross $17 million equity investment plus any un remitted profits in the venture. The contract has been segmented between the EC and OM portions of the work to be performed. The EC portion of the work will be accounted for using contract accounting revenue recognition principles. Revenue in connection with OM services including on demand services will be recognized as earned through the life of the contract. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2005. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the amount payable under a guarantee is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining 36 Table of Contents billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2005, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $9.7 million, including a recognized amount of $5.3 million associated with a guarantee of pollution control bonds related to zinc operations that were sold in 1987. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix costs at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. Debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon on all long term debt. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on its long term debt is not material due to the low fixed interest rates on the obligations. However, commercial paper, when outstanding, is issued at current short term interest rates, which could increase in the future. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2005, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 15 months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2005 was $52 million. Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. This trend reversed during 2005 and unrealized translation losses occurred. Most of these unrealized gains or losses relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held, the risk of realized translation losses is mitigated. In 2001, the company issued a warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares, at $36.06 per share, of the companys common stock to a partner in the companys e commerce procurement venture. Any compensation realized by the holder through exercise of the warrant will offset any royalties otherwise payable under a five year cooperation and services agreement. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; other non operating income and expense items; earnings or loss from discontinued operations; and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results During 2005, revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by 40 percent and 22 percent, respectively, compared with 2004. All of the companys business segments had higher revenue primarily due to increased project execution activity resulting from strong new award levels over the last three years. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years. The Oil Gas and Global Services segments are benefiting from this trend through improved revenue and operating profit. Also contributing to results in the Oil Gas segment was the completion of a major refinery upgrader project in Venezuela and final settlement of all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the project. This performance was, however, partially offset by an operating loss in the Industrial Infrastructure segment primarily due to settlements related to projects in the dispute resolution process and cost overruns on several projects. Revenue improved in the Government segment due to higher activity in Iraq and for support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in hurricane relief efforts; however, operating profit was essentially flat primarily due to cost overruns and recognized losses on certain embassy projects for the Department of State. The Industrial Infrastructure segment recognized losses in 2005 on various project related settlements, including two resort hotel projects in the Caribbean and two life sciences projects. In addition, a toll road project being executed by a joint venture in which the company has 50 percent participation, recognized losses in 2005 due to further increases in estimated costs. A loss was also recognized in 2004 on this project. The toll road project has experienced increased costs associated with scope changes requested by the client and other delay related costs. All of these projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of certain variances in cost estimates remain with the company. During 2004, revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with 2003. The 2004 improvement in revenue was concentrated in the Oil Gas, Government and Global Services segments. All segments, with the exception of Power, had increases in operating profit in 2004 compared with 2003. Revenue and operating profit in the Power segment were substantially lower in 2004 compared with 2003 due to the decline in new awards due to the cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction and resulting project completions. The Government segment benefited from increased revenue beginning in the first quarter of 2004 from business acquisitions completed in 2003 and early 2004. During 2005 the company recognized an accrual in the amount of $19.1 million for foreign employment related taxes that may be payable primarily on behalf of certain United States expatriate employees working in certain foreign jurisdictions. The employment taxes primarily relate to stock based compensation where local tax reporting requirements differ in the method of calculation of taxable amounts from the reporting required in the United States. The accrual recognizes the aggregate of taxes due on compensation as required to be reported in these foreign jurisdictions. Approximately $15.3 million of the charge was recognized in the Oil Gas segment with the majority of the balance recognized in Industrial Infrastructure and minor amounts in the Government and Global Services segments. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes for the three years ended December 31, 2005 were $300 million in 2005, $281 million in 2004 and $268 million in 2003. Because of the decline in Power segment earnings, 22 Table of Contents which related largely to projects located in the United States, domestic operating profit has continued to decline during 2005 and 2004, offset by increases in operating profits from non U.S. operations. The decrease in the 2005 tax rate compared with 2004 is primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefit associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. The company had net earnings of $2.62 per share in 2005 compared with $2.25 per share in 2004 and $1.95 per share in 2003. Results in 2003 were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of $0.15 per share and a loss of $0.13 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results of discontinued operations are further discussed below. The loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relates to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R) relating to consolidation of entities that owned certain of the companys leased facilities. Additional discussion of these facilities is contained in the Financing Obligations footnote in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see Segment Operations and Corporate and Tax Matters below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts. Engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor costs and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract costs and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2005, 68 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while 32 percent was for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees, as well as increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues realized from the projects. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $144 million and $105 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated, costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. 23 Table of Contents Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and costs, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures. Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues, costs and operating profits in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the Oil Gas, Industrial Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R) provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards. Foreign Currency. The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. The company does not engage in currency speculation. 24 Table of Contents Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2005 the company had deferred tax assets of $323.7 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $40.9 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $55.8 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Retirement Benefits. The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. The continuing trend in recent years of low long term interest rates has had the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $35 million and $70 million for the calendar year 2006. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $29 million. Share Based Payment. The company uses stock based compensation to reward key executives and align their interests with those of shareholders. Types of stock based compensation that have been awarded in recent years include restricted stock, options and stock appreciation rights. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Upon adoption of SFAS 123 R, pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer permitted. The provisions of SFAS 123 R apply to awards granted after the required effective date of the statement, which is no later than January 1, 2006 for the company. Initial application to existing unvested stock option awards may be based on either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method. The method of application selected by the company will determine which, if any, previously reported operating results will be restated. As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to APB 25 and, as such, recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123 Rs fair value method will have an impact on results of operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123 R will not be material based on unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2005. Had SFAS 123 R been adopted in prior periods, the impact would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of the new standard will also have an impact on the timing of expense recognition for new stock based awards, as discussed in the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123 R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. This requirement will generally impact cash provided or utilized by operating activities with equal offset in cash flows from financing activities in 25 Table of Contents periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amounts of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were $17 million, $14 million and $4 million in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance (EPCM) and is organized into five business segments: Oil Gas, Industrial Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil Gas segment provides engineering, procurement and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial Infrastructure segment provides engineering, procurement and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities, commercial and institutional buildings, mining, microelectronics, telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities. The Government segment provides project management, engineering, construction, and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, construction equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services. The Power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities. Oil Gas. In the first quarter of 2005, the chemicals business line, which had been part of the Industrial Infrastructure segment, was realigned under the Oil Gas segment. This change was made to better match the needs for the large number of petrochemical projects anticipated over the next few years with the Oil Gas segments large project support infrastructure. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. Commencing in the third quarter of 2004, as the result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor Daniel (ICA Fluor), its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment. ICA Fluor was previously included in the Power segment. Prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ICA Fluor. Revenue in the Oil Gas segment amounted to $5.3 billion, $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 54 percent increase during 2005 and 26 percent increase during 2004 resulted from the strength of new contract awards over the past several years due to the higher level of global oil and gas exploration and refining, and also included $294 million in 2005 from the Hamaca project settlement discussed further below. Operating profit margin in the Oil Gas segment was 4.6 percent in 2005 compared with 4.7 percent in 2004 and 4.4 percent in 2003. Although 2005 operating margin was favorably impacted by the $30.5 million settlement discussed in the following paragraph, margin was reduced by the impact of the $15.3 million employment tax charge discussed above under Summary of Overall Company Results. During the third quarter of 2005, the company settled all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project in Jose, Venezuela. The pending arbitration proceedings have been dismissed. The settlement reimbursed the company for its incurred costs arising from change orders on the project and for its cost of capital in funding those incurred costs. The settlement was recorded in revenue and resulted in recognition of $30.5 million in operating profit in the Oil Gas segment. New awards in the Oil Gas segment were $4.4 billion in 2005, $4.0 billion in 2004 and $4.1 billion in 2003. The segment is participating in an expanding market that includes very large mega projects in diverse geographical locations, which are very well suited for Fluors global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. New project awards in 2005 included $1.3 billion for two large international petrochemical projects, $1.0 billion for a gas complex in the United Arab Emirates and $774 million from a Canadian oil sands project. New project awards in 2004 included a $570 million oil sands project and a $244 million clean fuels project, which are both in Canada, a $346 million refinery complex modernization project in Mexico and a $176 million refinery upgrade project in South Africa. New project awards in 2003 include the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project, a major oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. Backlog for the Oil Gas segment was $6.0 billion, up sequentially from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2004 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2003. The 2005 growth relates principally to the continued strength of new awards and 26 Table of Contents project scope adjustments to existing projects. The 2004 backlog growth included the impacts of new awards and the reclassification of ICA Fluor during the year. Total assets in the Oil Gas segment decreased to $575 million at December 31, 2005 from $731 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting the net impact of the settlement on the Hamaca project, partially offset by additional costs associated with the higher level of project execution activities. Total assets in the Oil Gas segment were $523 million at December 31, 2003. The 2004 increase includes the impact of the growth in segment revenues, as well as incurred costs that were deferred on the Hamaca project of $70 million. Industrial Infrastructure. As mentioned above, in the first quarter of 2005, the chemicals business line, which had been part of the Industrial Infrastructure segment, was realigned under the Oil Gas segment. Again, this change was made to better match the needs for the large number of petrochemical projects anticipated over the next few years with the Oil Gas segments large project support infrastructure. All prior periods have been restated to reflect this change. The Industrial Infrastructure segment had revenues of $3.2 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues increased significantly during 2005, primarily as the result of the strength of 2004 contract awards. The 18 percent decline in revenues during 2004 resulted from slow start up progress on recently awarded projects and a lower level of new awards in the latter half of 2003. In addition, certain projects that were removed from backlog in 2003 also had a negative impact on the volume of work performed in 2004. The Industrial Infrastructure segment reported an operating loss of $16.7 million for 2005, compared with operating profits of $62.4 million and $63.1 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by provisions relating to specific projects. During 2005, a $32.1 million charge relating to the no liability resolution of a Cayman Islands project was recorded. On June 23, 2005, Fluor Daniel Caribbean, Inc. (FD Caribbean), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, received an unfavorable jury verdict awarding $28.8 million to the developer of a resort hotel project in the Caribbean. FD Caribbean was the general contractor on the project, which is located in the Cayman Islands. As a consequence, the company recorded a $65 million charge in its second quarter to recognize the jury award, estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest, and reversal of previously billed accounts receivable for work performed on the project. At the time of the original jury decision, the company strongly believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or by applicable law. On September 15, 2005, the judge who tried the case granted the companys motion for a new trial, setting aside the unfavorable verdict in its totality. On September 29, 2005, in lieu of a new trial, the parties stipulated to a judgment of no liability in favor of either side, and the action was dismissed with prejudice. As a result, the company reversed the provision for the jury award, estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest in the third quarter of 2005. The company participates in a 50/50 joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. The project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, and additional labor, resulting in additional costs due to schedule delays. The company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project costs, as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project. During 2005 and 2004, provisions of $24 million and $28 million, respectively, were recorded due to these increasing estimated costs. While the estimate of total project costs is based on the final design including changes directed by the client, any future changes in these estimates will be recognized when identified. To date, the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately $112 million to the client. Costs totaling $28.7 million have been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of December 31, 2005 and the company has recognized its $14.4 million proportionate share of these costs in revenue. In addition to charges arising from the Cayman Islands and transportation infrastructure projects discussed above, during 2005 the segment recorded provisions totaling approximately $50 million relating to a number of other projects that have been the subject of dispute resolution activities. Project losses recognized in 2005 include settlements on a resort hotel project in the Bahamas and two life sciences projects. These projects were bid under 27 Table of Contents fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company. Where the company had determined that costs incurred in excess of the contract price should be the responsibility of the owner, the company made claims against the owners for recovery of costs incurred. Dispute resolution activities have now been concluded on these matters and settlements have been finalized. Several other matters of lesser significance were concluded and incurred costs deemed to be unrecoverable including certain legal fees were recognized in 2005. During 2004, operating profit included the recorded provision for the transportation infrastructure project discussed above and a $7.2 million positive impact from a recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the Verde Gold project. In 2003, operating profit was negatively impacted by a $7.4 million charge relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in Australia. The company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its London Connect Project (LUL), a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the London Underground system. In February 2005, the company sought relief through arbitration proceedings for two issues. First, the company is seeking relief for the overall delay and disruption to the project that relates to the contract time period of 2001 through 2003. The arbitration hearing on this matter is scheduled to commence in May 2006. In addition, a claim for delay and disruption subsequent to 2003 will be submitted to the dispute resolution process shortly. The total costs incurred amounting to $44 million relating to delay and disruption for the entire contract period have been recognized as claims. The second issue concerns the responsibility for enabling the various train stock to accept the new telecommunication network equipment. Hearings involving LUL, the company and Motorola, a subcontractor, are completed and the parties await the arbitration award. New awards in the Industrial Infrastructure segment were $2.3 billion during 2005, following a very strong level of $4.6 billion in 2004 and $2.2 billion during 2003. The lower level of new awards in 2005 includes the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards. New awards in 2004 included a variety of mining, life sciences and manufacturing projects throughout the world. Backlog for the Industrial Infrastructure segment declined to $3.9 billion at the end of 2005 from $5.1 billion at the end of 2004. For 2003, ending backlog was $2.9 billion. The 2005 decline includes the impact of the lower level of new awards during the year and reductions relating primarily to the cancellations of a number of life sciences projects. The growth during 2004 was reflective of the substantial new awards during the year. Government. The Government segment had revenues of $2.7 billion, $2.3 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 19 percent increase in revenue during 2005 resulted principally from FEMA contracts associated with hurricane relief efforts in certain states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and an increase in reconstruction activity in Iraq. The 34 percent increase in revenue during 2004 resulted principally from reconstruction activity in Iraq, strong performance on environmental remediation programs for the Department of Energy (DOE), and approximately $220 million from businesses acquired in 2004 and 2003. Del Jen, Inc. (Del Jen) was acquired late in the first quarter of 2003 and J.A. Jones was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, Trend Western was acquired by Del Jen in the first quarter of 2004. Revenue in all three years includes work for ongoing environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project (Fernald) in Ohio and the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. The operating profit for the Government segment during 2005 of $83.7 million, or 3 percent of revenues, was essentially unchanged compared with 2004. Although 2005 operating profit increased due to the years revenue growth, that improvement was offset by a $5 million charge related to the settlement of a civil lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice and provisions totaling $56 million recognized on four embassy projects. These embassy projects have been adversely impacted by higher costs due to scope changes, unexpected execution problems, increases in material cost and subcontractor difficulties. The company has 11 embassy projects that are in various stages of completion under contracts with the United States Department of State. Claims for equitable adjustment on seven of these projects totaling approximately $77.5 million have been identified to date and as of December 31, 2005, $44.3 million in costs relating to these claims have been incurred and recognized in revenue. Additional claim recoveries continue to be evaluated. 28 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2004, operating profit of $83.5 million, or 3.7 percent of revenue, compares with $48.1 million, or 2.8 percent of revenue, during 2003. The earnings growth resulted from strong performance on environmental nuclear projects and from the full year effect of the Del Jen and Trend Western acquisitions. New awards in the Government segment were $2.5 billion during 2005, compared with $2.3 billion during 2004 and $2.0 billion in 2003. During the past two years new awards have increased due to new FEMA contracts, reconstruction activities in Iraq and business acquisitions. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months for annually funded contracts. Backlog has remained fairly constant over the past three years, at $1.4 billion for 2005 and $1.5 billion for 2004 and 2003. Total assets in the Government segment increased to $905 million at December 31, 2005, up from $654 million at December 31, 2004 and $475 million at December 31, 2003. The 2005 increase was the combined result of significant increases in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to FEMA and Iraq reconstruction projects, the embassy claims, and unbilled fees on the Fernald project. The 2004 increase related principally to Iraq reconstruction projects and unbilled fees on the Fernald project. The segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling $130 million related to the Fernald project. The project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in 2006. Deferred fees recognized in revenue in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $38.9 million, $36.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively. Global Services. The Global Services segment had revenues of $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Increased operations and maintenance and equipment rental activities have been the primary drivers of these increases. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 7.2 percent, 7.8 percent and 8.7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. The small decline during 2005 resulted from a shift in the mix of business among the segments various service lines. The 2004 decline was the result of lower levels of self perform construction activity and reduced margins resulting from competitive factors in the operations and maintenance business. The equipment, temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. New awards in the Global Services segment increased 42 percent, to $2.2 billion during 2005, and 23 percent, to $1.5 billion during 2004, from $1.3 billion during 2003. Continued growth in the number of client sites served gave rise to these increases. During 2005, backlog for the Global Services segment increased by 9 percent, to $2.5 billion, from $2.3 billion at the end of 2004. Backlog increased 24 percent during 2004, from $1.8 billion at December 31, 2003. This growth was principally the result of the increase in new awards discussed in the preceding paragraph, although a change in scope on a large maintenance contract resulted in the removal of $400 million in materials costs from backlog during 2005. Total assets in the Global Services segment increased to $640 million at December 31, 2005, up from $463 million at December 31, 2004 and $384 million at December 31, 2003. These increases were the combined result of significant increases in capital expenditures, accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to hurricane relief projects and equipment rentals associated with Iraq reconstruction contracts. Power. In July 2003, the company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation the decision to terminate the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership (D/FD) as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants. The dissolution was substantially completed in 2005 and did not have a material impact on results of 29 Table of Contents operations or financial position of the company. The Power segment continues to identify and pursue power generation opportunities with its own resources. Commencing in the third quarter of 2004, as the result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ICA Fluor, its operating results, new awards and backlog are included in the Oil Gas segment rather than the Power segment where it was previously reported. Prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ICA Fluor. The Power segment has reported significantly lower revenue in 2005 and 2004, of $384 million and $326 million, respectively, than during 2003, when $759 million was reported. This decline resulted from the reduced level of construction of new power plants discussed above. Operating profit margin in the Power segment declined to 3.5 percent during 2005 from 4.2 percent during 2004. The 2005 margin reflects the negative impact of a loss on one project, partly offset by favorable performance on a number of other projects. The 2004 margin reflects performance on projects that were either completed or nearing completion, where profit recognition is strongest and a favorable settlement for a dispute relating to a project that was completed in 2002. The favorable results were partly offset by unexpected costs associated with a waste coal power plant start up and commissioning. Operating margin during 2003 was a very strong 10.2 percent, which was attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of a number of projects. Projects in the Power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution, but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. New awards in the Power segment recovered due to a modest strengthening in the power generation market during 2005 and 2004. New awards were to $1.0 billion in 2005 and $612 million in 2004, compared with $485 million during 2003. New awards in 2005 included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in Kentucky and a 2000 megawatt power plant in Nevada. New awards in 2004 included one for the recommissioning of a power plant in South Africa and a contract for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in Nevada. Backlog for the Power segment increased to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 from $552 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting the new awards in 2005. During 2004, backlog declined from $605 million at December 31, 2003, which included the impact of the movement of ICA Fluor to the Oil Gas segment. Corporate and Tax Matters Corporate. For the three years ended December 31, 2005, corporate administrative and general expenses were $143.7 million, $142.4 million and $141.5 million, respectively. Included in these amounts is non operating income of $11 million, $9 million and $1 million, respectively. The 2005 and 2004 amounts relate primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties in both years and a gain from disposal of a residual property interest in 2004. Corporate administrative and general expense, excluding non operating items, increased two percent in 2005 and six percent in 2004. The factors that impacted the 2004 expense level continued in 2005, and additional expenses were incurred with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters, as discussed below. The 2004 increase was the net result of savings from successful expense reduction programs and favorable pension adjustments, offset by higher executive incentives and costs of complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. On May 10, 2005, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from Southern California to the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. This move is expected to improve operational efficiency and position the company to more effectively serve its global client base. Of the approximately 390 headquarters staff located in Aliso Viejo, California on May 10, 2005, approximately 200 employees will either stay in Southern California or move to other U.S. office locations. Approximately 80 employees from Southern California and other company locations will relocate to the new Texas headquarters where approximately 100 additional employees are expected to be hired. Approximately 130 employees will leave the company as a result of the move. 30 Table of Contents The cost of employee displacements is being accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of 2005 through the anticipated date of the Southern California headquarters office closure in the second quarter of 2006. All other relocation and hiring costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2005, corporate administrative expenses include $5.7 million for relocation costs, which comprises the accrual of employee displacement costs and other direct expenses. Additional employee relocation and hiring costs and facility relocation costs totaling approximately $19 million are expected to be incurred during 2006, which will also be included in corporate administrative and general expense. The existing corporate facility in Aliso Viejo was sold in September 2005. A short term, market rate lease back has been negotiated with the buyer that will allow the company to continue to occupy the facility for up to 18 months. The cost of the new Texas headquarters is expected to approximate $60 million and will be paid from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the current headquarters facility. Net interest income was $7.4 million, $3.5 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Higher interest income in 2005 relates principally to larger investment balances and higher short term interest rates. Tax. The effective tax rates on the companys continuing operations were 24.1 percent, 33.6 percent and 33.0 percent for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the 2005 tax rate compared with 2004 is primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefit associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) as more fully discussed below, and the reversal of certain valuation allowance resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. These aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely. During 2005, the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan. Accordingly, the 2005 tax rate reflects the U.S. tax effect on these earnings. The slight rise in the tax rate in 2004 compared with 2003 is primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses. Such increase, however, was partially offset by the reversal of certain valuation allowances arising from the utilization of certain tax credit carryforward, and the decrease in state income taxes largely attributable to the utilization of prior year net operating losses in California, which losses were suspended in 2003 and 2002 due to the states deficit position. In addition, during 2004 the company disposed of certain business assets, which resulted in a favorable effective tax rate variance due to certain permanent book/tax basis differences. On October 22, 2004, the Jobs Act was signed into law. Among its various provisions, the Jobs Act creates a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations. On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 2 allows companies additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the Jobs Act was enacted to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on a companys plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings for the purpose of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. On August 11, 2005, the companys Domestic Reinvestment Plan (the Plan) prepared pursuant to the Jobs Act was approved by the companys Chief Executive Officer. The Plan was ratified by the Executive Committee of the companys Board of Directors on August 29, 2005. On September 29, 2005, approximately $89 million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company, including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the Jobs Act. The results of operations for 2005 include a tax benefit of $3.8 million attributable to the dividends received deduction net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction. Note that this 31 Table of Contents tax benefit decreased slightly from $4.1 million reported in the third quarter due to a true up of the 2005 operating results in the fourth quarter. Discontinued Operations In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of certain non core operations of the companys construction equipment and non EPCM components of its temporary staffing businesses. An active program to consummate such disposal was initiated and completed as of the end of the second quarter of 2003. During 2003 the last remaining dealership operation was sold generating proceeds of $31.9 million. Revenue, earnings and loss on disposal for discontinued operations during 2003 were $30.1 million, $1.5 million and $13.1 million, respectively. There have been no results of operations reported as discontinued operations for any period subsequent to June 30, 2003. Matters in Dispute Resolution As of December 31, 2005, a number of matters relating to certain significant completed and in progress projects were in the dispute resolution process. The following discussion provides a background and current status of certain of these matters: Infrastructure Joint Venture Project Discussion of the status of an infrastructure joint venture project in California is included above under Industrial Infrastructure. London Connect Project Discussion of the status of the London Connect project is included above under Industrial Infrastructure. Embassy Projects Discussion of the status of these projects is included above under Government. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. V. General Electric Company, et al U.S.D.C., Southern District Court, New York In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the engineering, procurement and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded. In January 2005 the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases; the first to be a decision on entitlement and second, a decision on damages. On May 4, 2005 the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed Fluors entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for costs incurred in construction of the plant. A decision determining the amount recoverable has yet to be issued by the arbitration panel. Dearborn Industrial Project Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) started as a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan. The initial Turnkey Agreement, dated November 24, 1998, consisted of three phases. Commencing shortly after Notice to Proceed, the owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. 32 Table of Contents The Project was severely delayed with completion of Phase II. DIG unilaterally took over completion and operation of Phase II and commissioned that portion of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit which Duke/Fluor Daniel (D/FD) expects to recover upon resolution of the dispute. D/FD retains lien rights (in fee) against the project. In October 2001, D/FD commenced an action in Michigan State Court to foreclose on the lien interest. In December 2001, DIG filed a responsive pleading denying liability and simultaneously served a demand for arbitration to D/FD claiming, among other things, that D/FD is liable to DIG for alleged construction delays and defective engineering and construction work at the Dearborn plant. The court has ordered the matter to arbitration. The lien action remains stayed pending completion of the arbitration of D/FDs claims against DIG and DIGs claims against D/FD. An arbitration panel has been appointed and the arbitration is underway. Financial Position and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities during 2005 was $409 million of which $245 million was provided by reductions in net operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to cash collected in connection with the close out of the Hamaca project. The company used significant cash in 2004 and 2003 to fund ongoing work and change orders relating to the Hamaca project. In both 2004 and 2003, net operating assets and liabilities increased by amounts greater than funds generated by other earnings sources resulting in cash being utilized by operating activities. Significant cash was used in 2004 and 2003 to fund projects in the Power segment resulting in a reduction in advances from affiliate of $45 million and $213 million, respectively. These advances represented the companys proportional share of excess cash from Duke/Fluor Daniel that was generated from client advance payments received in prior years upon award of projects. With the completion of nearly all work on Duke/Fluor Daniel projects as of the end of 2004, the amounts advanced to the company had been substantially repaid to the partnership and used in project execution. The company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation in 2003, the decision to dissolve the partnership. The dissolution was largely completed in 2005 with no significant impact on cash flows. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. The increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress, which prior to 2004 included the companys proportional share of excess cash that was advanced to the company by Duke/Fluor Daniel. As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. In the event there is net investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. While contributions to defined contribution plans have remained relatively stable over the past three years, contributions to the defined benefit plans have shown more variability, at $89 million in 2005 compared with $30 million in 2004 and $52 million in 2003. The large contributions in 2005 and 2003 were due in part to the variability of actual returns on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan that was not fully funded in 2004 and 2003 received a contribution totaling $60 million which provides full funding to the level of accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 all plans are funded to at least the level of accumulated benefits. During 2003, the receipt of funds from insurance claims relating to the Murrin Murrin project amounted to $84.1 million. As of December 31, 2005, amounts due from the insurance companies for claims submitted have been collected except for minor amounts of arbitration defense costs. Business acquisitions utilized cash of $33.0 million during 2004 (for the acquisition of Trend Western) and $54.5 million during 2003 (for the acquisition of Del Jen, P2S and J.A. Jones International). Cash flows from 33 Table of Contents investing activities during 2005 and 2004 included $45.0 million and $58.6 million from the sale of real estate assets and a residual property interest and $24.7 million and $22.2 million, respectively from the disposal of other property, plant and equipment. During 2003 the company realized $26.1 million from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and $31.9 million in proceeds from the sale of the last discontinued equipment dealership operation. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included capital expenditures of $213.2 million, $104.4 million and $79.0 million, respectively, for continuing operations. Capital expenditures for continuing operations include $23.9 million in 2005 for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in Texas, but otherwise relate primarily relate to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures over the past three years related largely to rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq in all years and hurricane recovery in the United States during 2005. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, completion of the new headquarters facility and renewal and refurbishment of other facilities, and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. New engineering and construction joint ventures of the Industrial and Infrastructure segment in the United Kingdom during 2005 required capital contributions totaling approximately $30 million. In July 2004, the company entered into a new, five year, $800 million Senior Credit Facility. The agreement replaced existing facilities totaling $700 million. Of the total capacity, $300 million is dedicated to commercial paper back up lines. The balance is available for letters of credit and funded loans. As of December 31, 2004, primarily in response to significant increases in funds required for project operations, the company had outstanding borrowings of $129.9 million in the commercial paper market. These borrowings were repaid during 2005. During 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off all outstanding commercial paper and $100.0 million was used to obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash if a specified trading price of the companys common stock (the trigger price) is achieved and maintained for a specified period and the Notes are presented by the holders for conversion. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the trigger price was achieved for the specified number of days and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2005. The company does not know the amount, if any, of the Notes that will be presented for conversion, and will use available cash balances to satisfy any required repayments. In December 2004, the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. The company has entered into a distribution agreement for up to two million shares of common stock. During 2005 the company sold 758,367 shares under this distribution agreement, realizing net proceeds of $41.8 million. During 2005, an equity bridge loan and non recourse project financing provided $16.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively, of financing cash flow. These amounts relate to the consolidation of a joint venture, as discussed in National Roads Telecommunications Services Project below. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $50.6 million, $61.7 million and $28.5 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. No purchases were made during 2005 or 2004. During 2003, the company purchased 94,000 shares for total consideration of $2.7 million. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. There is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program. Cash dividends declared in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were at the rate of $0.64 per share. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. However, for the dividend paid to shareholders as of January 3, 2006, payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of 34 Table of Contents December 2005, resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the dividend payable April 3, 2006 to $0.20 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. This trend reversed during 2005 and unrealized translation losses occurred. Unrealized losses of $32.9 million in 2005 and unrealized gains of $40.0 million and $45.1 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand, short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (including contractual obligations). The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $976 million in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. In addition, the company has $61 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2005, the company had utilized $542 million of its letter of credit capacity. The company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms, primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 330 $ 330 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 17 17 4.65% equity bridge loan 17 17 Non recourse project finance debt 58 34 24 Operating leases (1) 248 27 49 38 134 Compensation related obligations 311 26 66 68 151 Guarantee of pollution control bonds 5 3 2 Total $ 986 $ 386 $ 168 $ 130 $ 302 (1) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other domestic and international locations. The company has a joint venture arrangement that will design, build, finance and maintain an aircraft refueling facility at a United States Air Force base in Qatar for the Defense Energy Support Center, an agency of the Department of Defense. The company has a 27.5 percent interest in the joint venture company. On April 29, 2005, the joint venture entered into an agreement for project financing which includes a joint and several project completion guarantee by the members of the joint venture. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required under the guarantee is $76.5 million, the maximum principal amount available under the financing arrangement, plus any accrued interest. The facility is presently over 50 percent complete and proceeding as expected. 35 Table of Contents National Roads Telecommunications Services (NRTS) Project During 2005 the companys Industrial Infrastructure segment was awarded a $544 million project by a joint venture, GeneSYS Telecommunications Limited (GeneSYS), which is consolidated in the companys consolidated financial statements. The project was entered into with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport (the Highways Agency) to design, build, maintain and finance a new integrated transmission network throughout Englands motorways. The project will be executed by GeneSYS in which the company owns a 45 percent interest and HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited, which owns a 55 percent interest. GeneSYS will finance the engineering and construction (EC) of upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately $240 million (140 million) of non recourse debt (the term loan facility) from a consortium of lenders (the Banks) along with joint venture member capital contributions totaling approximately $37 million (22 million). The equity contributions by the joint venture members have been provided through equity bridge loans from the Banks. The loans have been guaranteed or secured in proportion to each members equity participation. The equity bridge loans are repayable upon completion of the upgrade at which time the equity members are required to fund their contributions to the joint venture. During construction, the availability of the existing telecommunications network will be maintained for the Highways Agency by GeneSYS. Upon completion of the upgrade, operating availability of the network will be provided to the Highways Agency and the system will be fully maintained by GeneSYS. Under this arrangement, GeneSYS is entitled to payments from the Highways Agency for network availability, operations and maintenance (OM) plus fees for on demand maintenance services. The company has been engaged by GeneSYS to provide design engineering and construction of the network as well as OM and on demand services for the existing and upgraded facilities under a subcontract extending through 2016. Based on a qualitative analysis of the operations of GeneSYS and the variable interests of all parties to the arrangement, under the provisions of FIN 46 R the company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The companys December 31, 2005 financial statements include the accounts of GeneSYS, and, accordingly, the nonrecourse debt provided by the Banks. The term loan facility provides for interest only at LIBOR plus a margin of 95 basis points during construction of the upgraded facilities reducing to a margin of 90 basis points after completion of construction and continuing until fully repaid. Commitment fees are payable on unused portions of the facility. Payments are due in installments over the term of the services period ending in 2016. The term loan facility is an obligation of GeneSYS and will never be a debt obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. Accordingly, in the event of a default on the term loans, the lenders may only look to the resources of GeneSYS for repayment. The debt will never be repayable from assets of the company beyond its gross $17 million equity investment plus any un remitted profits in the venture. The contract has been segmented between the EC and OM portions of the work to be performed. The EC portion of the work will be accounted for using contract accounting revenue recognition principles. Revenue in connection with OM services including on demand services will be recognized as earned through the life of the contract. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2005. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the amount payable under a guarantee is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining 36 Table of Contents billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2005, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $9.7 million, including a recognized amount of $5.3 million associated with a guarantee of pollution control bonds related to zinc operations that were sold in 1987. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix costs at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. Debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon on all long term debt. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on its long term debt is not material due to the low fixed interest rates on the obligations. However, commercial paper, when outstanding, is issued at current short term interest rates, which could increase in the future. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2005, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 15 months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2005 was $52 million. Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. This trend reversed during 2005 and unrealized translation losses occurred. Most of these unrealized gains or losses relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held, the risk of realized translation losses is mitigated. In 2001, the company issued a warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares, at $36.06 per share, of the companys common stock to a partner in the companys e commerce procurement venture. Any compensation realized by the holder through exercise of the warrant will offset any royalties otherwise payable under a five year cooperation and services agreement.
