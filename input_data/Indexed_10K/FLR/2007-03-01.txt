Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results During 2006, revenue increased by 7 percent compared with 2005. This increase is the primary result of higher project execution activities in the Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments and work being performed in continuing support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for hurricane relief efforts that started in 2005. The level of FEMA activity declined in the second half of 2006, as the companys work on hurricane relief efforts was completed. Additionally, a large Department of Energy (DOE) project has been completed. These factors, plus lower activity in Iraq, resulted in reduced revenue in the second half of 2006 for the Government segment, which was largely offset by revenue growth in the other segments. Earnings before taxes for 2006 increased by 28 percent compared with 2005. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years. The Oil & Gas and Global Services segments are benefiting from this trend, as reflected in improved operating results. Additionally, during 2006 the Industrial & Infrastructure segment returned to profitability after reporting an operating loss for 2005. Partially offsetting these operating profit improvements during 2006 were provisions totaling $183 million on fixed price projects in the Government segment. Provisions for losses on certain fixed price embassy projects totaling $154 million were recognized in 2006, in addition to provisions totaling $56 million during 2005. The embassy projects have been subject to significant cost increases resulting from schedule extensions, scope changes, client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. Civil unrest impacting the project in Haiti has also caused significant schedule delays resulting in increased cost. In addition to the provisions on the embassy projects, provisions totaling $29 million were recognized during 2006 for cost overruns due to difficulties with a subcontractor on a fixed price project in Afghanistan. See further discussion of the embassy and Afghanistan provisions under Government below. During 2005, revenue and earnings before taxes increased by 40 percent and 22 percent, respectively, compared with 2004. All of the companys business segments had higher revenue primarily due to increased project execution activity resulting from strong new award levels in the previous years. Contributing to results in the Oil & Gas segment was the completion of a major refinery upgrader project in Venezuela and final settlement of all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the project. This performance was, however, partially offset by an operating loss in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment primarily due to settlements related to projects in the dispute resolution process and cost overruns on several projects. Revenue improved in the Government segment due to higher activity in Iraq and in support of the FEMA hurricane relief efforts; however, operating profit was essentially flat primarily due to the embassy project losses discussed above. Earnings before taxes for 2005 included gains of $15 million from the sale of the former corporate facility and other real estate assets and a provision in the amount of $19 million for foreign employment related taxes primarily on behalf of certain United States expatriate employees working in certain foreign jurisdictions. Approximately $15 million of the charge was recognized in the Oil & Gas segment with the majority of the balance recognized in Industrial & Infrastructure and minor amounts in the Government and Global Services segments. 23 Earnings before taxes were $382 million in 2006, $300 million in 2005 and $281 million in 2004. During 2006, U.S. earnings before taxes increased significantly primarily due to FEMA activity, while embassy project losses reduced non U.S. earnings before taxes. The effective tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately 31 percent, 24 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Variability in effective tax rates in recent years is discussed below under Corporate and Tax Matters. The company had net earnings of $2.95 per share in 2006 compared with $2.62 per share in 2005 and $2.25 per share in 2004. Consolidated new awards for 2006 were $19.3 billion, compared with $12.5 billion during 2005 and $13.0 billion in 2004. The Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure segments had increases in new awards during 2006, partially offset by lower new awards in the Global Services, Government and Power segments. Consolidated backlog at December 31, 2006 of $21.9 billion was 47 percent higher compared with backlog of $14.9 billion at December 31, 2005. Consolidated backlog was essentially unchanged at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see Segment Operations and Corporate and Tax Matters below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared with total estimated contract cost. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2006, 74 percent of the companys backlog is cost reimbursable while 26 percent is for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees, as well as increases in contract cost can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable cost, which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. 24 Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $200 million and $144 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and cost, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue, cost and operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R) provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards, and may reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events. Foreign Currency The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. 25 Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. The company does not engage in currency speculation. Deferred Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2006 the company had deferred tax assets of $470 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $46 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $98 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Also, the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the company will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007. The company continues to evaluate the impact of FIN 48 but does not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on the financial statements. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. The extended period of low long term interest rates has had the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $40 million and $60 million for the calendar year 2007, which is in excess of the minimum funding required. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $34 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). This statement amends SFAS 87 and requires that the funded status of plans, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit 26 obligations, be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic benefit cost. The statement was adopted in 2006 and resulted in a $180 million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which reduced shareholders equity. Share Based Payment The company uses stock based compensation to reward key executives and align their interests with those of shareholders. Types of stock based compensation that have been awarded in recent years include restricted stock, stock options and stock appreciation rights. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values and prohibits the recording of additional capital from restricted stock until those instruments vest. With the adoption of SFAS 123 R, pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer an alternative. The provisions of SFAS 123 R generally apply to awards granted after the required effective date of the statement, which was January 1, 2006 for the company. The company has elected the modified prospective method of application and, accordingly, has not restated previously reported financial condition, operating results or the presentation of cash flows. The elimination of additional capital associated with unvested restricted shares resulted in an offsetting reversal of unamortized executive stock plan expense upon implementation of SFAS 123 R. Additionally, the presentation of cash flows for 2006 has been modified to reflect the benefits of tax deductions for stock compensation in excess of recognized compensation cost as financing cash flows, with an offsetting amount in operating cash flows, as now required. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the company recognized pretax compensation expense, including the impact on expense of retirement eligibility discussed below, of $4.6 million ($0.03 per diluted share after tax) associated with stock options. The per share fair value of such options was determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Previously under APB 25, no compensation cost was recognized for unvested stock options where the grant price was equal to the market price on the date of grant and the vesting provisions were based only on the passage of time. Had SFAS 123 R been adopted in 2005 and 2004, the impacts would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The company has not historically considered retirement eligibility in determining stock based compensation expense, including expense associated with stock options and restricted stock. The adoption of SFAS 123 R required the company to assume the first date on which an employee becomes eligible to retire in determining the amortization period for stock based awards. For example, if the employee is eligible for retirement two years from the date of grant, the amortization period will be no longer than two years rather than the specified service period over which awards normally vest. Retirement eligibility has been considered in the determination of periodic expense on a prospective basis for current year awards, and compensation expense associated with awards granted in prior periods has continued to be recognized using historical straight line amortization practices based on award specific vesting periods. The impact of using retirement eligibility in determining all stock option expense would have been to decrease the pro forma adjustments by approximately 70 percent and 65 percent, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The impact of using retirement eligibility to determine amortization periods for all restricted stock awards would have been to increase recorded restricted stock amortization expense by approximately one third during 2005 and 2004. The impact of using retirement eligibility to determine amortization periods for 2006 stock option and restricted stock awards was to increase pretax amortization expense by approximately $2.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for an aggregate after tax impact of $0.08 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006. 27 Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance (EPCM) and is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil & Gas segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides design, engineering, procurement and construction professional services for transportation projects, mining, life sciences facilities, telecommunications projects, manufacturing facilities, commercial and institutional, microelectronics and healthcare facilities. The Government segment provides project management, engineering, construction and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, small capital project execution, equipment, industrial fleet outsourcing, plant turnaround, temporary staffing, strategic sourcing and construction related support services. The Power segment provides professional services to the gas, solid fuel, nuclear and plant betterment marketplace. Oil & Gas Revenue in the Oil & Gas segment amounted to $5.4 billion, $5.3 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Increased levels of project execution activities during 2006 more than replaced the $294 million of revenue that was recognized in 2005 from the settlement of a project dispute in Venezuela. The 54 percent increase in revenue during 2005 resulted from the strength of new contract awards that has accompanied the increased level of global oil and gas exploration and refining and also included the project settlement. Operating profit margin in the Oil & Gas segment was 5.7 percent in 2006 compared with 4.6 percent in 2005 and 4.7 percent in 2004. The operating margin in 2006 includes the impact of favorable project performance during the year, as well as an increase in the level of higher margin front end engineering and design work. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $10.4 billion in 2006, $4.4 billion in 2005 and $4.0 billion in 2004. The segment is participating in an expanding market that includes very large mega projects in diverse geographical locations, which are very well suited for Fluors global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. New project awards in 2006 included a $1.8 billion refinery expansion in the United States, a $2.2 billion project in Saudi Arabia and a project in excess of $1 billion in Qatar. New project awards in 2005 included $1.3 billion for two large international petrochemical projects, $1.0 billion for a gas complex in the United Arab Emirates and $774 million from a Canadian oil sands project. New project awards in 2004 included a $570 million oil sands project and a $244 million clean fuels project, which are both in Canada, a $346 million refinery complex modernization project in Mexico and a $176 million refinery upgrade project in South Africa. Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $12.0 billion at December 31, 2006, up sequentially from $6.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The 2006 and 2005 growth relate principally to the continued strength of new awards and positive project scope adjustments to existing projects. Total assets in the Oil & Gas segment increased to $629 million at December 31, 2006 from $575 million at December 31, 2005 due to additional working capital associated with the continued increase in the level of project execution activities. Total assets of the segment decreased during 2005 from $731 million at the end of 2004, reflecting the net impact of the project settlement, partially offset by additional working capital associated with the increased level of project execution activities. Industrial & Infrastructure The Industrial & Infrastructure segment had revenue of $3.2 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and $2.1 billion in 2004. Although revenue remained fairly constant in total for 2006 and 2005, the mix of new business in the current year has shifted somewhat from manufacturing facilities to large infrastructure and mining projects that generally have longer execution periods. This has resulted in significant growth in backlog to $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2006. Revenue increased significantly during 2005, primarily as the result of the strength of 2004 contract awards. 28 The segment reported an operating profit of $76.4 million for 2006, compared with an operating loss of $16.7 million in 2005 and an operating profit of $62.4 million for 2004. The improvement during 2006 includes the favorable impacts of successful project performance, improved margins on more recent projects and overhead spending reductions. Operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects. The segment participates in a 50/50 joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. The project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays, resulting in additional cost. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, provisions of $30 million, $24 million and $28 million, respectively, were recorded due to increasing estimated cost. The company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost, as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project. To date, the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately $130 million to the client. Cost of $59 million has been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of December 31, 2006 and the company has recognized its $29 million proportionate share of this cost in revenue. The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2007. During 2005, a charge relating to the resolution of a Cayman Islands project was recognized. On June 23, 2005, Fluor Daniel Caribbean, Inc. (FD Caribbean) received an unfavorable jury verdict awarding $28.8 million to the developer of a resort hotel project in the Caribbean. FD Caribbean was the general contractor on the project, which is located in the Cayman Islands. As a consequence, the segment recorded a $65 million charge in the second quarter of 2005 to recognize the jury award, estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest and reversal of previously billed accounts receivable for work performed on the project. At the time of the original jury decision, the company strongly believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or by applicable law. On September 15, 2005, the judge who tried the case granted the companys motion for a new trial, setting aside the unfavorable verdict in its totality. On September 29, 2005, in lieu of a new trial, the parties stipulated to a judgment of no liability in favor of either side and the action was dismissed with prejudice. As a result, $32.9 million of the second quarter 2005 charge was reversed in the third quarter of 2005, resulting in a net charge of $32.1 million for the hotel project settlement during 2005. In addition to charges arising from the transportation infrastructure and Cayman Islands projects discussed above, during 2005 the segment recorded provisions totaling approximately $50 million relating to a number of other projects that had been the subject of dispute resolution activities. These losses included settlements on a resort hotel project in the Bahamas and two life sciences projects. The projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company. Where the company had determined that cost incurred in excess of the contract price should be the responsibility of the owner, the company made claims against the owners for recovery of cost incurred. Dispute resolution activities were concluded on these matters and settlements finalized during 2005. Several other matters of lesser significance were concluded and incurred cost deemed to be unrecoverable, including certain legal fees, was recognized in 2005. The company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its London Connect Project (LUL), a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the London Underground system. In February 2005, the company sought relief through arbitration proceedings for two issues. First, the company is seeking relief for the overall delay and disruption to the project. The arbitration hearings on the claim that relates to the contract time period of 2001 through 2003 has been held and an interim decision from the arbitrator was received in December 2006. The parties have each filed appeals relating to certain aspects of the decision and further hearings on those issues are expected in the spring of 2008. A claim for delay and disruption for the 2004 through 2005 time period has been submitted to the dispute resolution process. Reflecting the interim outcome for 2001 through 2003, the company has recognized $74 million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to the delay and disruption claims. In addition, the company was assessed and has paid $54 million representing its share of liquidated damages. This payment has not been recognized as a reduction in project revenue because it is expected that amounts assessed will be substantially recovered upon resolution of the companys claims. The second issue concerns the responsibility for enabling the various train stock to accept the new telecommunication network equipment. The hearings on this issue 29 have concluded and resulted in sustaining the companys position that it did not have any responsibility for costs associated with this portion of the work under the contract. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $4.5 billion during 2006, $2.3 billion in 2005 and $4.6 billion during 2004. New awards during 2006 increased across most of the segments business lines, with new mining projects representing approximately 45 percent of the total. The lower level of new awards in 2005 includes the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards. New awards in 2004 included a variety of mining, life sciences and manufacturing projects throughout the world. Backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment increased to $5.4 billion at the end of 2006 from $3.9 billion at the end of 2005. For 2004, ending backlog was $5.1 billion. The 2005 decline includes the impact of the lower level of new awards during the year and reductions relating primarily to the cancellations of a number of life sciences projects. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment increased to $686 million at December 31, 2006 from $490 million at December 31, 2005 as the principal result of revenue recognized in connection with the National Roads Telecommunications Services project discussed below under Financial Position and Liquidity. Government The Government segment had revenue of $2.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue in all three years includes reconstruction activity in Iraq and work for environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project (Fernald) in Ohio, which was completed in 2006, and the ongoing Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. Revenue during 2006 and 2005 includes hurricane relief activities in support of FEMA. The six percent increase in revenue in 2006 compared with 2005 resulted from the continuation of hurricane relief activities in support of FEMA, which commenced in the second half of 2005, partially offset by reduced Iraq reconstruction and DOE project activity. The level of FEMA activity increased during early 2006, but began to decline in the third and fourth quarters of the year, as the companys work on hurricane relief efforts was completed. The decline in DOE activity resulted largely from the completion of the Fernald project at the end of October, 2006. The 19 percent increase in revenue during 2005 resulted principally from new FEMA contracts associated with hurricane relief efforts in certain states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and an increase in reconstruction activity in Iraq. The operating profit for the Government segment during 2006 was $17.7 million, compared with $83.7 million and $83.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating profit contribution during 2006 from FEMA contracts was more than offset by loss provisions totaling $183 million on the projects discussed below. Although 2005 operating profit increased due to the years revenue growth, that improvement was largely offset by loss provisions on the embassy projects discussed below. The company has been performing work on 11 embassy projects for the United States Department of State under fixed price contracts over the last three years. These projects have been adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions, scope changes causing material deviations from the Standard Embassy Design, increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. As of December 31, 2006, projects in Kazakhstan, Jamaica and Belize were completed and the facilities are occupied, bringing the total to nine embassies that have been completed. The project in Greece will be completed in early 2007 and, as of January 31, 2007, the physical completion of the Haiti embassy has progressed to approximately 40 percent. During 2006, the company recognized provisions totaling $154 million for estimated cost overruns on these projects, including substantial amounts relating to the embassy in Haiti, where periods of civil unrest have resulted in significant unanticipated schedule delays and cost increases. In addition, at the site in Haiti, increased cost has resulted from collapsible soil conditions, additional client imposed requirements and subsequent increases in material quantities and the availability and productivity of construction labor. The company recognized provisions for estimated cost overruns on certain of the embassy projects totaling $56 million in 2005. 30 Claims for equitable adjustment on seven of the projects totaling approximately $81 million have been submitted or identified to date. As the first formal step in dispute resolution, the majority of these claims have now been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements. As of December 31, 2006, $59 million in cost relating to these claims have been incurred and recognized in revenue. Additional claims continue to be evaluated. In addition to the provisions on the embassy projects, provisions totaling $29 million were recognized during 2006 for subcontractor cost overruns on a fixed price project at the Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. Due to performance and quality issues, the primary subcontractors scope has been substantially reduced and the estimated cost to complete the project using alternative resources has further escalated. The provisions include the estimated impact of schedule delays and limited site access due to client imposed restrictions. The project is estimated to be completed in mid 2007. New awards in the Government segment were $2.2 billion during 2006, compared with $2.5 billion during 2005 and $2.3 billion in 2004. During the past two years new awards have included emergency response work for FEMA, reconstruction activities in Iraq and the environmental restoration work at two DOE sites. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months for annually funded contracts. Backlog declined during 2006 to $840 million from $1.4 billion in 2005 and $1.5 billion in 2004 as the result of progress towards completion on the Fernald and Iraq contracts. FEMA awards have generally been performed very quickly and therefore have not significantly impacted backlog from one period to the next. The company no longer pursues projects in the embassy market. Total assets in the Government segment were $597 million at December 31, 2006, down from $905 million at December 31, 2005. This decrease was the principal result of progress towards completion on the FEMA and Iraq reconstruction contracts. During 2005, segment assets increased from $654 million at December 31, 2004. This increase was the combined result of significant increases in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to FEMA and Iraq reconstruction projects, deferred cost associated with embassy claims and unbilled fees on the Fernald project. The segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling $135 million on the Fernald project at December 31, 2006, up from $130 million at the end of 2005 and $91 million at the end of 2004. The unbilled fees, of which $118 million are included in other current assets and $17 million are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, reflect the favorable impact of accelerated completion and will be billed and collected upon the completion of project close out activities. Collection of substantially all of the unbilled fees is expected in the first half of 2007. Global Services The Global Services segment had revenue of $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 increase occurred broadly across the segments business. Increased operations and maintenance and equipment rental activities were the primary drivers of the 2005 increase. The segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models. Operating profit for the Global Services segment was $152.4 million in 2006 compared with $113.7 million in 2005 and $100.0 million in 2004. The 2006 increase reflects the strong business environment extending across most of Global Services markets as well as the favorable impact of hurricane recovery activities. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 7.1 percent, 7.2 percent and 7.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. The decline during 2005 resulted from a shift in the mix of business among the segments various service lines. The equipment, temporary staffing, strategic sourcing and construction services business lines do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. In recent years, Global Services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from short duration operations and maintenance activities and from other business not traditionally reported in backlog. 31 New awards in the Global Services segment were $1.6 billion during 2006, $2.2 billion during 2005 and $1.5 billion during 2004. New awards in 2005 included two large multi year operations and maintenance awards. During 2006, backlog for the Global Services segment declined to $2.3 billion, compared with $2.5 billion at the end of 2005. Contributing to the 2006 backlog decline was the execution in 2006 of a substantial portion of a fixed duration contract. Backlog increased 9 percent during 2005, from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2004. This growth was principally the result of the increase in new awards discussed in the preceding paragraph, although a change in scope on a large maintenance contract resulted in the removal of $400 million in materials cost from backlog during 2005. Total assets in the Global Services segment increased to $721 million at December 31, 2006, up from $640 million at December 31, 2005 and $463 million at December 31, 2004 as the principal result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth. Power The Power segment reported revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004, of $542 million, $384 million and $326 million, respectively. Revenue levels in recent years have been negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in 2003. Operating profit margin in the Power segment declined to 0.8 percent during 2006 from 3.5 percent during 2005 and 4.2 percent in 2004. The lower 2006 margin was the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of the Dearborn Industrial Project discussed below, a loss on another project, a concentration of projects that are in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market. Although the power market is entering an expansion phase, that has not yet translated to significantly improved operating performance for the segment. The 2005 margin includes the negative impact of a loss on one project, partly offset by successful project close out activities on a number of other projects. The 2004 margin reflects performance on projects that were either completed or nearing completion, where profit recognition is strongest, and a favorable settlement for a dispute relating to a project that was completed in 2002. The favorable results were partly offset by unexpected cost associated with a waste coal power plant start up and commissioning. Projects in the Power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution, but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) was a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan that was executed by the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership. The owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. The Project was severely delayed and DIG unilaterally took over completion and operation of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit. Subsequently, the matter was referred to arbitration and in December 2006 Duke/Fluor Daniel was awarded a net amount of $12 million. The award included full recovery of the letter of credit and certain other cost, but the arbitrators unexpectedly awarded DIG certain amounts. The company recognized a provision of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 representing its proportionate share of the overall shortfall in recovery. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount, but occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $635 million during 2006 include a plant retrofit project in South Carolina. New awards of $1 billion during 2005 included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in Kentucky and a 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada. New awards of $612 million in 2004 included one for the recommissioning of a power plant in South Africa and a contract for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in Nevada. Backlog for the Power segment increased sequentially to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and from $552 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting growth in the number of projects in progress. Total assets in the Power segment increased to $137 million at December 31, 2006 from $94 million at December 31, 2005 and $61 million at December 31, 2004, due to additional working capital associated with the higher level of project execution activities. 32 Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2006, corporate administrative and general expenses were $178.8 million, $143.7 million and $142.4 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are non operating expenses of $5 million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during 2006 and non operating income of $9 million for each year 2005 and 2004. The 2005 and 2004 amounts relate primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties in both years and a gain from disposal of a residual property interest in 2004. Corporate administrative and general expense, excluding non operating items, increased 14 percent in 2006 and one percent in 2005. The 2006 increase includes $13.1 million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard. Additionally, during 2006, expenses recorded with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters increased by $8.5 million. On May 10, 2005, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from Southern California to the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. As of the end of the second quarter of 2006, the relocation was completed. Approximately 120 employees in Southern California who did not relocate to Texas left the company. The cost of these employee displacements was accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of 2005 through the date of the employee departures. All other relocation and hiring cost has been charged to expense as incurred. Total relocation cost included in corporate administrative and general expense was $14.2 million and $5.7 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The corporate facility in Aliso Viejo was sold in September 2005. A short term, market rate lease back agreement that was negotiated with the buyer terminated on June 30, 2006. The cost to construct the new Texas headquarters totaled $60 million and was funded from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the former headquarters facility. Net interest income was $4.3 million, $7.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 decrease was the net result of interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of 2006 that were required to support project execution activities, an increase in the interest rates on those commercial paper borrowings and the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt starting in the fourth quarter of 2005, partially offset by higher cash balances and investment interest rates during the second half of the year. Higher interest income in 2005 related principally to larger investment balances and higher short term interest rates. Tax The effective tax rates on the companys pretax earnings were 31.0 percent, 24.1 percent and 33.6 percent for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion, a domestic production activities deduction related to domestic construction projects and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of associated tax benefits, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes. The comparatively low 2005 tax rate was primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefits associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) as more fully discussed below and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. These aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely. During 2005, the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan. Accordingly, the 2005 tax rate reflects the U.S. tax effect on these earnings. On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. Among its various provisions, the AJCA creates a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations. On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation 33 Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 2 allows companies additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the AJCA was enacted to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on a companys plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings for the purpose of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. On August 11, 2005, the companys Domestic Reinvestment Plan (the Plan) prepared pursuant to the AJCA was approved by the companys Chief Executive Officer. The Plan was ratified by the Executive Committee of the companys Board of Directors on August 29, 2005. On September 29, 2005, approximately $89 million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company, including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the AJCA. The results of operations for 2005 included a tax benefit of $3.8 million attributable to the dividends received deduction, net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution Conex International v. Fluor Enterprises, Inc. In November 2006, a Jefferson County, Texas, jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of Conex International (Conex) v. Fluor Enterprises Inc. (FEI), ruling in favor of Conex and awarded $98.8 million in damages related to a 2001 construction project. In 2001, Atofina (now part of Total Petrochemicals Inc.) hired Conex International to be the mechanical contractor on a project at Atofinas refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. FEI was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to Atofina on the project. There was no contract between Conex and FEI. Later in 2001 after the project was complete, Conex and Atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project. Conex sued FEI in September 2003 alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that FEI should pay Conex the balance of the extra work charges that Atofina did not pay in the settlement. Conex also asserted that FEI interfered with Conexs contract and business relationship with Atofina. The jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference. The company will appeal the decision and believes, based on the advice of counsel, that it is probable that any judgment based on this verdict would be overturned. The company strongly believes that this verdict is supported neither by the facts nor the law and will pursue all possible avenues for reconsideration or appeal. Accordingly, the company did not recognize a charge reflecting the verdict amount. As of December 31, 2006, a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process. These include an Infrastructure Joint Venture Project and the London Connect Project, which are discussed above under Industrial & Infrastructure and certain Embassy Projects, which are discussed above under Government. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. v. General Electric Company, et al In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded. In January 2005 the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases; the first to be a decision on entitlement and second, a decision on damages. On May 4, 2005 the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed Fluors entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for cost incurred in construction of the plant. A decision determining the amount recoverable has yet to be issued by the arbitration panel. 34 Financial Position and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities during 2006 was $296 million compared with $409 million in 2005. Operating activities utilized $86 million during 2004. The 2005 amount includes $245 million collected in connection with the close out of a project in Venezuela. The company used significant cash in 2004 to fund ongoing work and change orders relating to this project and the completion of nearly all work on Power segment projects that were being executed through the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership. The company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation in 2003, the decision to dissolve the partnership. The dissolution has been largely completed with no significant impact on cash flows. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. The increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress. As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. In the event there is net investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. While contributions to defined contribution plans have increased over the past three years in response to increases in the number of eligible employees, contributions to the defined benefit plans have shown more variability, at $41 million in 2006 compared with $89 million in 2005 and $30 million in 2004. The large contributions in 2005 were due in part to the variability of actual returns on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan that was not fully funded in 2004 received a contribution totaling $60 million during 2005, which provided full funding to the level of accumulated benefits as of the end of that year. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005 all plans are funded to the level of accumulated benefits. Cash flows from investing activities during 2005 and 2004 included $45.0 million and $58.6 million, respectively, from the sale of real estate assets and a residual property interest. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $39.3 million, $24.7 million and $22.2 million, respectively were received from the disposal of other property, plant and equipment. Property disposals relate primarily to ongoing renewal and replacements in the Global Services segment. The acquisition of Trend Western utilized cash of $33.0 million during 2004. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004 included capital expenditures of $274.1 million, $213.2 million and $104.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures include $35.5 million in 2006 and $23.9 million in 2005 for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in Texas, but otherwise relate primarily to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures over the past three years related largely to the ongoing renewal and replacement in the construction equipment operations, rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq in 2005 and 2004 and hurricane recovery in the United States during 2005. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, renewal and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. New engineering and construction joint ventures of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment in the United Kingdom during 2005 required capital contributions totaling approximately $30 million. During 2006, the company amended and restated its Senior Credit Facility, increasing the size from $800 million to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity to 2011. During 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo 35 engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash if a specified trading price of the companys common stock (the trigger price) is achieved and maintained for a specified period and the Notes are presented by the holders for conversion. During the fourth quarter of 2005 and throughout 2006, the trigger price was achieved for the specified number of days and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The company does not know the amount, if any, of the Notes that will be presented for conversion, and will use available cash balances to satisfy any required repayments. In December 2004, the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the company subsequently entered into a distribution agreement for up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2005 the company sold 758,367 shares under this distribution agreement, realizing net proceeds of $41.8 million. No shares were issued in 2006 or 2004 under this distribution agreement. During 2006, non recourse project financing provided $127.3 million of financing cash flow. During 2005, an equity bridge loan and non recourse project financing provided $16.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively, of financing cash flow. These amounts relate to the consolidation of a joint venture, as discussed below under Non Recourse Project Financing. A warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares was exercised in 2006, yielding proceeds of $16.6 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $15.2 million, $50.6 million and $61.7 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. No purchases were made during 2006, 2005 or 2004. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. There is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program. In the first quarter of 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend payable April 3, 2006 to $0.20 per share. Subsequent dividends have continued at this rate. Quarterly cash dividends declared totaled $0.16 per share in both 2005 and 2004. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. However, for the dividend paid to shareholders as of January 3, 2006, payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of December 2005, resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter of 2005. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. During 2006 and 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. During 2005 the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar, and unrealized translation losses occurred. Unrealized gains of $10.3 million in 2006 and $40.0 million in 2004 and unrealized losses of $32.9 million in 2005 primarily relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand, short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. 36 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (including contractual obligations) The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $2.1 billion in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2006, the company had utilized $686 million of its letter of credit capacity. In addition, the company has $107 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. The company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms, primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 330 $ 330 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 4.65% equity bridge loan 19 19 Non recourse project finance debt 193 23 46 73 51 Interest on all obligations(1) 44 17 10 7 10 Operating leases(2) 277 35 74 45 123 Pension minimum funding(3) 217 15 97 105 Other post employment benefits 49 6 13 11 19 Other compensation related obligations(4) 290 20 62 54 154 Guarantee of pollution control bonds 3 3 Total $ 1,440 $ 468 $ 302 $ 295 $ 375 (1) Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payment indicated in the above table. Interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted. (2) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3) The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans based on the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (4) Principally deferred executive compensation. The company has a joint venture arrangement to design, build, finance and maintain an aircraft refueling facility at a United States Air Force base in Qatar for the Defense Energy Support Center, an agency of the Department of Defense. The company has a 27.5 percent interest in the joint venture company. On April 29, 2005, the joint venture entered into an agreement for project financing which includes a joint and several project completion guarantee by the members of the joint venture. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required under the guarantee is $76.5 million, the maximum principal amount available under the financing arrangement, plus any accrued interest. The facility has now been completed and was accepted by the customer in January 2007. Non Recourse Project Financing During 2005, the companys Industrial & Infrastructure segment was awarded a $544 million project by a joint venture, GeneSYS Telecommunications Limited (GeneSYS), which is consolidated in the companys consolidated financial statements. The project was entered into with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport (the Highways Agency) to design, build, maintain and finance a new integrated transmission network throughout Englands motorways. The project will be executed by GeneSYS in which the company owns a 45 percent interest and HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited, which owns a 55 percent interest. GeneSYS will finance the engineering and construction (E&C) of upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately $273 million 37 (140 million) of non recourse debt (the term loan facility) from a consortium of lenders (the Banks) along with joint venture member capital contributions totaling approximately $43 million (22 million). The equity contributions by the joint venture members have been provided through equity bridge loans from the Banks. The loans have been guaranteed or secured in proportion to each members equity participation. The equity bridge loans are repayable upon completion of the upgrade at which time the equity members are required to fund their contributions to the joint venture, which is expected to occur in 2007. Based on a qualitative analysis of the operations of GeneSYS and the variable interests of all parties to the arrangement, under the provisions of FIN 46 R the company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The companys 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GeneSYS and accordingly, the non recourse debt provided by the Banks totaling $192.8 million and $57.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in the 2006 amount is $23.4 million that will become payable in 2007. The term loan facility provides for interest only at LIBOR plus a margin of 95 basis points during construction of the upgraded facilities reducing to a margin of 90 basis points after completion of construction and continuing until fully repaid. Commitment fees are payable on unused portions of the facility. Payments commence in 2008 and are due in installments over the term of the services period ending in 2016. The term loan facility is an obligation of GeneSYS and will never be a debt obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. Accordingly, in the event of a default on the term loans, the lenders may only look to the resources of GeneSYS for repayment. The debt will never be repayable from assets of the company beyond its gross $19 million equity investment plus any un remitted profits in the venture. The contract has been segmented between the E&C and operations and maintenance (O&M) portions of the work to be performed. The E&C portion of the work is being accounted for using contract accounting revenue recognition principles. As of December 31, 2006, a total of $172.5 million of E&C revenue has been recognized, including $143.3 million during 2006, for which the related receivable is included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Revenue in connection with O&M services including on demand services will be recognized as earned through the life of the contract. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2006. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where cost exceeds the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. The carrying value of the liability for guarantees is not material. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment 38 which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2006, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $4.9 million. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. The companys presently outstanding debt instruments, except non recourse and associated equity bridge loan project finance debt, carry a fixed rate coupon. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on fixed rate debt is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations. Outstanding project finance debt is subject to a floating interest rate and, commercial paper, when outstanding, is issued at current short term interest rates, which could result in higher interest cost if such rates increase in the future. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2006, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 15 months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2006 was $242 million. During 2006 and 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. During 2005, the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar, and unrealized translation losses occurred. Because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held, the exposure to realized translation gains or losses is mitigated. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, operating profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results During 2006, revenue increased by 7 percent compared with 2005. This increase is the primary result of higher project execution activities in the Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments and work being performed in continuing support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for hurricane relief efforts that started in 2005. The level of FEMA activity declined in the second half of 2006, as the companys work on hurricane relief efforts was completed. Additionally, a large Department of Energy (DOE) project has been completed. These factors, plus lower activity in Iraq, resulted in reduced revenue in the second half of 2006 for the Government segment, which was largely offset by revenue growth in the other segments. Earnings before taxes for 2006 increased by 28 percent compared with 2005. The company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years. The Oil & Gas and Global Services segments are benefiting from this trend, as reflected in improved operating results. Additionally, during 2006 the Industrial & Infrastructure segment returned to profitability after reporting an operating loss for 2005. Partially offsetting these operating profit improvements during 2006 were provisions totaling $183 million on fixed price projects in the Government segment. Provisions for losses on certain fixed price embassy projects totaling $154 million were recognized in 2006, in addition to provisions totaling $56 million during 2005. The embassy projects have been subject to significant cost increases resulting from schedule extensions, scope changes, client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. Civil unrest impacting the project in Haiti has also caused significant schedule delays resulting in increased cost. In addition to the provisions on the embassy projects, provisions totaling $29 million were recognized during 2006 for cost overruns due to difficulties with a subcontractor on a fixed price project in Afghanistan. See further discussion of the embassy and Afghanistan provisions under Government below. During 2005, revenue and earnings before taxes increased by 40 percent and 22 percent, respectively, compared with 2004. All of the companys business segments had higher revenue primarily due to increased project execution activity resulting from strong new award levels in the previous years. Contributing to results in the Oil & Gas segment was the completion of a major refinery upgrader project in Venezuela and final settlement of all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the project. This performance was, however, partially offset by an operating loss in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment primarily due to settlements related to projects in the dispute resolution process and cost overruns on several projects. Revenue improved in the Government segment due to higher activity in Iraq and in support of the FEMA hurricane relief efforts; however, operating profit was essentially flat primarily due to the embassy project losses discussed above. Earnings before taxes for 2005 included gains of $15 million from the sale of the former corporate facility and other real estate assets and a provision in the amount of $19 million for foreign employment related taxes primarily on behalf of certain United States expatriate employees working in certain foreign jurisdictions. Approximately $15 million of the charge was recognized in the Oil & Gas segment with the majority of the balance recognized in Industrial & Infrastructure and minor amounts in the Government and Global Services segments. 23 Earnings before taxes were $382 million in 2006, $300 million in 2005 and $281 million in 2004. During 2006, U.S. earnings before taxes increased significantly primarily due to FEMA activity, while embassy project losses reduced non U.S. earnings before taxes. The effective tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately 31 percent, 24 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Variability in effective tax rates in recent years is discussed below under Corporate and Tax Matters. The company had net earnings of $2.95 per share in 2006 compared with $2.62 per share in 2005 and $2.25 per share in 2004. Consolidated new awards for 2006 were $19.3 billion, compared with $12.5 billion during 2005 and $13.0 billion in 2004. The Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure segments had increases in new awards during 2006, partially offset by lower new awards in the Global Services, Government and Power segments. Consolidated backlog at December 31, 2006 of $21.9 billion was 47 percent higher compared with backlog of $14.9 billion at December 31, 2005. Consolidated backlog was essentially unchanged at December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see Segment Operations and Corporate and Tax Matters below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared with total estimated contract cost. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2006, 74 percent of the companys backlog is cost reimbursable while 26 percent is for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees, as well as increases in contract cost can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable cost, which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. 24 Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for costs. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $200 million and $144 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and cost, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue, cost and operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46 R) provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 00 01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards, and may reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events. Foreign Currency The company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in U.S. dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. 25 Under certain limited circumstances, such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts. Managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies. The company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure. The objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made. The company does not engage in currency speculation. Deferred Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2006 the company had deferred tax assets of $470 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $46 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $98 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for non U.S. subsidiaries, and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Also, the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the company will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007. The company continues to evaluate the impact of FIN 48 but does not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on the financial statements. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended (SFAS 87). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. The extended period of low long term interest rates has had the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved, future funding obligations could increase substantially. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $40 million and $60 million for the calendar year 2007, which is in excess of the minimum funding required. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $34 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). This statement amends SFAS 87 and requires that the funded status of plans, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit 26 obligations, be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic benefit cost. The statement was adopted in 2006 and resulted in a $180 million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which reduced shareholders equity. Share Based Payment The company uses stock based compensation to reward key executives and align their interests with those of shareholders. Types of stock based compensation that have been awarded in recent years include restricted stock, stock options and stock appreciation rights. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123 R), which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values and prohibits the recording of additional capital from restricted stock until those instruments vest. With the adoption of SFAS 123 R, pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer an alternative. The provisions of SFAS 123 R generally apply to awards granted after the required effective date of the statement, which was January 1, 2006 for the company. The company has elected the modified prospective method of application and, accordingly, has not restated previously reported financial condition, operating results or the presentation of cash flows. The elimination of additional capital associated with unvested restricted shares resulted in an offsetting reversal of unamortized executive stock plan expense upon implementation of SFAS 123 R. Additionally, the presentation of cash flows for 2006 has been modified to reflect the benefits of tax deductions for stock compensation in excess of recognized compensation cost as financing cash flows, with an offsetting amount in operating cash flows, as now required. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the company recognized pretax compensation expense, including the impact on expense of retirement eligibility discussed below, of $4.6 million ($0.03 per diluted share after tax) associated with stock options. The per share fair value of such options was determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Previously under APB 25, no compensation cost was recognized for unvested stock options where the grant price was equal to the market price on the date of grant and the vesting provisions were based only on the passage of time. Had SFAS 123 R been adopted in 2005 and 2004, the impacts would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The company has not historically considered retirement eligibility in determining stock based compensation expense, including expense associated with stock options and restricted stock. The adoption of SFAS 123 R required the company to assume the first date on which an employee becomes eligible to retire in determining the amortization period for stock based awards. For example, if the employee is eligible for retirement two years from the date of grant, the amortization period will be no longer than two years rather than the specified service period over which awards normally vest. Retirement eligibility has been considered in the determination of periodic expense on a prospective basis for current year awards, and compensation expense associated with awards granted in prior periods has continued to be recognized using historical straight line amortization practices based on award specific vesting periods. The impact of using retirement eligibility in determining all stock option expense would have been to decrease the pro forma adjustments by approximately 70 percent and 65 percent, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The impact of using retirement eligibility to determine amortization periods for all restricted stock awards would have been to increase recorded restricted stock amortization expense by approximately one third during 2005 and 2004. The impact of using retirement eligibility to determine amortization periods for 2006 stock option and restricted stock awards was to increase pretax amortization expense by approximately $2.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for an aggregate after tax impact of $0.08 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006. 27 Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance (EPCM) and is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil & Gas segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides design, engineering, procurement and construction professional services for transportation projects, mining, life sciences facilities, telecommunications projects, manufacturing facilities, commercial and institutional, microelectronics and healthcare facilities. The Government segment provides project management, engineering, construction and contingency response services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance, small capital project execution, equipment, industrial fleet outsourcing, plant turnaround, temporary staffing, strategic sourcing and construction related support services. The Power segment provides professional services to the gas, solid fuel, nuclear and plant betterment marketplace. Oil & Gas Revenue in the Oil & Gas segment amounted to $5.4 billion, $5.3 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Increased levels of project execution activities during 2006 more than replaced the $294 million of revenue that was recognized in 2005 from the settlement of a project dispute in Venezuela. The 54 percent increase in revenue during 2005 resulted from the strength of new contract awards that has accompanied the increased level of global oil and gas exploration and refining and also included the project settlement. Operating profit margin in the Oil & Gas segment was 5.7 percent in 2006 compared with 4.6 percent in 2005 and 4.7 percent in 2004. The operating margin in 2006 includes the impact of favorable project performance during the year, as well as an increase in the level of higher margin front end engineering and design work. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $10.4 billion in 2006, $4.4 billion in 2005 and $4.0 billion in 2004. The segment is participating in an expanding market that includes very large mega projects in diverse geographical locations, which are very well suited for Fluors global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. New project awards in 2006 included a $1.8 billion refinery expansion in the United States, a $2.2 billion project in Saudi Arabia and a project in excess of $1 billion in Qatar. New project awards in 2005 included $1.3 billion for two large international petrochemical projects, $1.0 billion for a gas complex in the United Arab Emirates and $774 million from a Canadian oil sands project. New project awards in 2004 included a $570 million oil sands project and a $244 million clean fuels project, which are both in Canada, a $346 million refinery complex modernization project in Mexico and a $176 million refinery upgrade project in South Africa. Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $12.0 billion at December 31, 2006, up sequentially from $6.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The 2006 and 2005 growth relate principally to the continued strength of new awards and positive project scope adjustments to existing projects. Total assets in the Oil & Gas segment increased to $629 million at December 31, 2006 from $575 million at December 31, 2005 due to additional working capital associated with the continued increase in the level of project execution activities. Total assets of the segment decreased during 2005 from $731 million at the end of 2004, reflecting the net impact of the project settlement, partially offset by additional working capital associated with the increased level of project execution activities. Industrial & Infrastructure The Industrial & Infrastructure segment had revenue of $3.2 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and $2.1 billion in 2004. Although revenue remained fairly constant in total for 2006 and 2005, the mix of new business in the current year has shifted somewhat from manufacturing facilities to large infrastructure and mining projects that generally have longer execution periods. This has resulted in significant growth in backlog to $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2006. Revenue increased significantly during 2005, primarily as the result of the strength of 2004 contract awards. 28 The segment reported an operating profit of $76.4 million for 2006, compared with an operating loss of $16.7 million in 2005 and an operating profit of $62.4 million for 2004. The improvement during 2006 includes the favorable impacts of successful project performance, improved margins on more recent projects and overhead spending reductions. Operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects. The segment participates in a 50/50 joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. The project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays, resulting in additional cost. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, provisions of $30 million, $24 million and $28 million, respectively, were recorded due to increasing estimated cost. The company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost, as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project. To date, the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately $130 million to the client. Cost of $59 million has been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of December 31, 2006 and the company has recognized its $29 million proportionate share of this cost in revenue. The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2007. During 2005, a charge relating to the resolution of a Cayman Islands project was recognized. On June 23, 2005, Fluor Daniel Caribbean, Inc. (FD Caribbean) received an unfavorable jury verdict awarding $28.8 million to the developer of a resort hotel project in the Caribbean. FD Caribbean was the general contractor on the project, which is located in the Cayman Islands. As a consequence, the segment recorded a $65 million charge in the second quarter of 2005 to recognize the jury award, estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest and reversal of previously billed accounts receivable for work performed on the project. At the time of the original jury decision, the company strongly believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or by applicable law. On September 15, 2005, the judge who tried the case granted the companys motion for a new trial, setting aside the unfavorable verdict in its totality. On September 29, 2005, in lieu of a new trial, the parties stipulated to a judgment of no liability in favor of either side and the action was dismissed with prejudice. As a result, $32.9 million of the second quarter 2005 charge was reversed in the third quarter of 2005, resulting in a net charge of $32.1 million for the hotel project settlement during 2005. In addition to charges arising from the transportation infrastructure and Cayman Islands projects discussed above, during 2005 the segment recorded provisions totaling approximately $50 million relating to a number of other projects that had been the subject of dispute resolution activities. These losses included settlements on a resort hotel project in the Bahamas and two life sciences projects. The projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company. Where the company had determined that cost incurred in excess of the contract price should be the responsibility of the owner, the company made claims against the owners for recovery of cost incurred. Dispute resolution activities were concluded on these matters and settlements finalized during 2005. Several other matters of lesser significance were concluded and incurred cost deemed to be unrecoverable, including certain legal fees, was recognized in 2005. The company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its London Connect Project (LUL), a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the London Underground system. In February 2005, the company sought relief through arbitration proceedings for two issues. First, the company is seeking relief for the overall delay and disruption to the project. The arbitration hearings on the claim that relates to the contract time period of 2001 through 2003 has been held and an interim decision from the arbitrator was received in December 2006. The parties have each filed appeals relating to certain aspects of the decision and further hearings on those issues are expected in the spring of 2008. A claim for delay and disruption for the 2004 through 2005 time period has been submitted to the dispute resolution process. Reflecting the interim outcome for 2001 through 2003, the company has recognized $74 million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to the delay and disruption claims. In addition, the company was assessed and has paid $54 million representing its share of liquidated damages. This payment has not been recognized as a reduction in project revenue because it is expected that amounts assessed will be substantially recovered upon resolution of the companys claims. The second issue concerns the responsibility for enabling the various train stock to accept the new telecommunication network equipment. The hearings on this issue 29 have concluded and resulted in sustaining the companys position that it did not have any responsibility for costs associated with this portion of the work under the contract. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $4.5 billion during 2006, $2.3 billion in 2005 and $4.6 billion during 2004. New awards during 2006 increased across most of the segments business lines, with new mining projects representing approximately 45 percent of the total. The lower level of new awards in 2005 includes the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards. New awards in 2004 included a variety of mining, life sciences and manufacturing projects throughout the world. Backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment increased to $5.4 billion at the end of 2006 from $3.9 billion at the end of 2005. For 2004, ending backlog was $5.1 billion. The 2005 decline includes the impact of the lower level of new awards during the year and reductions relating primarily to the cancellations of a number of life sciences projects. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment increased to $686 million at December 31, 2006 from $490 million at December 31, 2005 as the principal result of revenue recognized in connection with the National Roads Telecommunications Services project discussed below under Financial Position and Liquidity. Government The Government segment had revenue of $2.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue in all three years includes reconstruction activity in Iraq and work for environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project (Fernald) in Ohio, which was completed in 2006, and the ongoing Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. Revenue during 2006 and 2005 includes hurricane relief activities in support of FEMA. The six percent increase in revenue in 2006 compared with 2005 resulted from the continuation of hurricane relief activities in support of FEMA, which commenced in the second half of 2005, partially offset by reduced Iraq reconstruction and DOE project activity. The level of FEMA activity increased during early 2006, but began to decline in the third and fourth quarters of the year, as the companys work on hurricane relief efforts was completed. The decline in DOE activity resulted largely from the completion of the Fernald project at the end of October, 2006. The 19 percent increase in revenue during 2005 resulted principally from new FEMA contracts associated with hurricane relief efforts in certain states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and an increase in reconstruction activity in Iraq. The operating profit for the Government segment during 2006 was $17.7 million, compared with $83.7 million and $83.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating profit contribution during 2006 from FEMA contracts was more than offset by loss provisions totaling $183 million on the projects discussed below. Although 2005 operating profit increased due to the years revenue growth, that improvement was largely offset by loss provisions on the embassy projects discussed below. The company has been performing work on 11 embassy projects for the United States Department of State under fixed price contracts over the last three years. These projects have been adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions, scope changes causing material deviations from the Standard Embassy Design, increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. As of December 31, 2006, projects in Kazakhstan, Jamaica and Belize were completed and the facilities are occupied, bringing the total to nine embassies that have been completed. The project in Greece will be completed in early 2007 and, as of January 31, 2007, the physical completion of the Haiti embassy has progressed to approximately 40 percent. During 2006, the company recognized provisions totaling $154 million for estimated cost overruns on these projects, including substantial amounts relating to the embassy in Haiti, where periods of civil unrest have resulted in significant unanticipated schedule delays and cost increases. In addition, at the site in Haiti, increased cost has resulted from collapsible soil conditions, additional client imposed requirements and subsequent increases in material quantities and the availability and productivity of construction labor. The company recognized provisions for estimated cost overruns on certain of the embassy projects totaling $56 million in 2005. 30 Claims for equitable adjustment on seven of the projects totaling approximately $81 million have been submitted or identified to date. As the first formal step in dispute resolution, the majority of these claims have now been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements. As of December 31, 2006, $59 million in cost relating to these claims have been incurred and recognized in revenue. Additional claims continue to be evaluated. In addition to the provisions on the embassy projects, provisions totaling $29 million were recognized during 2006 for subcontractor cost overruns on a fixed price project at the Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. Due to performance and quality issues, the primary subcontractors scope has been substantially reduced and the estimated cost to complete the project using alternative resources has further escalated. The provisions include the estimated impact of schedule delays and limited site access due to client imposed restrictions. The project is estimated to be completed in mid 2007. New awards in the Government segment were $2.2 billion during 2006, compared with $2.5 billion during 2005 and $2.3 billion in 2004. During the past two years new awards have included emergency response work for FEMA, reconstruction activities in Iraq and the environmental restoration work at two DOE sites. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months for annually funded contracts. Backlog declined during 2006 to $840 million from $1.4 billion in 2005 and $1.5 billion in 2004 as the result of progress towards completion on the Fernald and Iraq contracts. FEMA awards have generally been performed very quickly and therefore have not significantly impacted backlog from one period to the next. The company no longer pursues projects in the embassy market. Total assets in the Government segment were $597 million at December 31, 2006, down from $905 million at December 31, 2005. This decrease was the principal result of progress towards completion on the FEMA and Iraq reconstruction contracts. During 2005, segment assets increased from $654 million at December 31, 2004. This increase was the combined result of significant increases in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to FEMA and Iraq reconstruction projects, deferred cost associated with embassy claims and unbilled fees on the Fernald project. The segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling $135 million on the Fernald project at December 31, 2006, up from $130 million at the end of 2005 and $91 million at the end of 2004. The unbilled fees, of which $118 million are included in other current assets and $17 million are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006, reflect the favorable impact of accelerated completion and will be billed and collected upon the completion of project close out activities. Collection of substantially all of the unbilled fees is expected in the first half of 2007. Global Services The Global Services segment had revenue of $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 increase occurred broadly across the segments business. Increased operations and maintenance and equipment rental activities were the primary drivers of the 2005 increase. The segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models. Operating profit for the Global Services segment was $152.4 million in 2006 compared with $113.7 million in 2005 and $100.0 million in 2004. The 2006 increase reflects the strong business environment extending across most of Global Services markets as well as the favorable impact of hurricane recovery activities. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 7.1 percent, 7.2 percent and 7.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. The decline during 2005 resulted from a shift in the mix of business among the segments various service lines. The equipment, temporary staffing, strategic sourcing and construction services business lines do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. In recent years, Global Services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from short duration operations and maintenance activities and from other business not traditionally reported in backlog. 31 New awards in the Global Services segment were $1.6 billion during 2006, $2.2 billion during 2005 and $1.5 billion during 2004. New awards in 2005 included two large multi year operations and maintenance awards. During 2006, backlog for the Global Services segment declined to $2.3 billion, compared with $2.5 billion at the end of 2005. Contributing to the 2006 backlog decline was the execution in 2006 of a substantial portion of a fixed duration contract. Backlog increased 9 percent during 2005, from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2004. This growth was principally the result of the increase in new awards discussed in the preceding paragraph, although a change in scope on a large maintenance contract resulted in the removal of $400 million in materials cost from backlog during 2005. Total assets in the Global Services segment increased to $721 million at December 31, 2006, up from $640 million at December 31, 2005 and $463 million at December 31, 2004 as the principal result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth. Power The Power segment reported revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004, of $542 million, $384 million and $326 million, respectively. Revenue levels in recent years have been negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in 2003. Operating profit margin in the Power segment declined to 0.8 percent during 2006 from 3.5 percent during 2005 and 4.2 percent in 2004. The lower 2006 margin was the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of the Dearborn Industrial Project discussed below, a loss on another project, a concentration of projects that are in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market. Although the power market is entering an expansion phase, that has not yet translated to significantly improved operating performance for the segment. The 2005 margin includes the negative impact of a loss on one project, partly offset by successful project close out activities on a number of other projects. The 2004 margin reflects performance on projects that were either completed or nearing completion, where profit recognition is strongest, and a favorable settlement for a dispute relating to a project that was completed in 2002. The favorable results were partly offset by unexpected cost associated with a waste coal power plant start up and commissioning. Projects in the Power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution, but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. The Dearborn Industrial Project (the Project) was a co generation combined cycle power plant project in Dearborn, Michigan that was executed by the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership. The owner/operator, Dearborn Industrial Generation (DIG), issued substantial change orders enlarging the scope of the project. The Project was severely delayed and DIG unilaterally took over completion and operation of the plant. Shortly thereafter, DIG drew upon a $30 million letter of credit. Subsequently, the matter was referred to arbitration and in December 2006 Duke/Fluor Daniel was awarded a net amount of $12 million. The award included full recovery of the letter of credit and certain other cost, but the arbitrators unexpectedly awarded DIG certain amounts. The company recognized a provision of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 representing its proportionate share of the overall shortfall in recovery. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount, but occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $635 million during 2006 include a plant retrofit project in South Carolina. New awards of $1 billion during 2005 included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in Kentucky and a 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada. New awards of $612 million in 2004 included one for the recommissioning of a power plant in South Africa and a contract for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in Nevada. Backlog for the Power segment increased sequentially to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and from $552 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting growth in the number of projects in progress. Total assets in the Power segment increased to $137 million at December 31, 2006 from $94 million at December 31, 2005 and $61 million at December 31, 2004, due to additional working capital associated with the higher level of project execution activities. 32 Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2006, corporate administrative and general expenses were $178.8 million, $143.7 million and $142.4 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are non operating expenses of $5 million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during 2006 and non operating income of $9 million for each year 2005 and 2004. The 2005 and 2004 amounts relate primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties in both years and a gain from disposal of a residual property interest in 2004. Corporate administrative and general expense, excluding non operating items, increased 14 percent in 2006 and one percent in 2005. The 2006 increase includes $13.1 million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard. Additionally, during 2006, expenses recorded with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters increased by $8.5 million. On May 10, 2005, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from Southern California to the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. As of the end of the second quarter of 2006, the relocation was completed. Approximately 120 employees in Southern California who did not relocate to Texas left the company. The cost of these employee displacements was accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of 2005 through the date of the employee departures. All other relocation and hiring cost has been charged to expense as incurred. Total relocation cost included in corporate administrative and general expense was $14.2 million and $5.7 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The corporate facility in Aliso Viejo was sold in September 2005. A short term, market rate lease back agreement that was negotiated with the buyer terminated on June 30, 2006. The cost to construct the new Texas headquarters totaled $60 million and was funded from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the former headquarters facility. Net interest income was $4.3 million, $7.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 decrease was the net result of interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of 2006 that were required to support project execution activities, an increase in the interest rates on those commercial paper borrowings and the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt starting in the fourth quarter of 2005, partially offset by higher cash balances and investment interest rates during the second half of the year. Higher interest income in 2005 related principally to larger investment balances and higher short term interest rates. Tax The effective tax rates on the companys pretax earnings were 31.0 percent, 24.1 percent and 33.6 percent for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion, a domestic production activities deduction related to domestic construction projects and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of associated tax benefits, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes. The comparatively low 2005 tax rate was primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefits associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) as more fully discussed below and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. These aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely. During 2005, the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan. Accordingly, the 2005 tax rate reflects the U.S. tax effect on these earnings. On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. Among its various provisions, the AJCA creates a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations. On December 21, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation 33 Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 2 allows companies additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the AJCA was enacted to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on a companys plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings for the purpose of applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. On August 11, 2005, the companys Domestic Reinvestment Plan (the Plan) prepared pursuant to the AJCA was approved by the companys Chief Executive Officer. The Plan was ratified by the Executive Committee of the companys Board of Directors on August 29, 2005. On September 29, 2005, approximately $89 million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company, including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the AJCA. The results of operations for 2005 included a tax benefit of $3.8 million attributable to the dividends received deduction, net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution Conex International v. Fluor Enterprises, Inc. In November 2006, a Jefferson County, Texas, jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of Conex International (Conex) v. Fluor Enterprises Inc. (FEI), ruling in favor of Conex and awarded $98.8 million in damages related to a 2001 construction project. In 2001, Atofina (now part of Total Petrochemicals Inc.) hired Conex International to be the mechanical contractor on a project at Atofinas refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. FEI was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to Atofina on the project. There was no contract between Conex and FEI. Later in 2001 after the project was complete, Conex and Atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project. Conex sued FEI in September 2003 alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that FEI should pay Conex the balance of the extra work charges that Atofina did not pay in the settlement. Conex also asserted that FEI interfered with Conexs contract and business relationship with Atofina. The jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference. The company will appeal the decision and believes, based on the advice of counsel, that it is probable that any judgment based on this verdict would be overturned. The company strongly believes that this verdict is supported neither by the facts nor the law and will pursue all possible avenues for reconsideration or appeal. Accordingly, the company did not recognize a charge reflecting the verdict amount. As of December 31, 2006, a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process. These include an Infrastructure Joint Venture Project and the London Connect Project, which are discussed above under Industrial & Infrastructure and certain Embassy Projects, which are discussed above under Government. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. v. General Electric Company, et al In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded. In January 2005 the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases; the first to be a decision on entitlement and second, a decision on damages. On May 4, 2005 the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed Fluors entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for cost incurred in construction of the plant. A decision determining the amount recoverable has yet to be issued by the arbitration panel. 34 Financial Position and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities during 2006 was $296 million compared with $409 million in 2005. Operating activities utilized $86 million during 2004. The 2005 amount includes $245 million collected in connection with the close out of a project in Venezuela. The company used significant cash in 2004 to fund ongoing work and change orders relating to this project and the completion of nearly all work on Power segment projects that were being executed through the Duke/Fluor Daniel partnership. The company jointly announced with Duke Energy Corporation in 2003, the decision to dissolve the partnership. The dissolution has been largely completed with no significant impact on cash flows. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. The increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress. As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. In the event there is net investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. While contributions to defined contribution plans have increased over the past three years in response to increases in the number of eligible employees, contributions to the defined benefit plans have shown more variability, at $41 million in 2006 compared with $89 million in 2005 and $30 million in 2004. The large contributions in 2005 were due in part to the variability of actual returns on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan that was not fully funded in 2004 received a contribution totaling $60 million during 2005, which provided full funding to the level of accumulated benefits as of the end of that year. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005 all plans are funded to the level of accumulated benefits. Cash flows from investing activities during 2005 and 2004 included $45.0 million and $58.6 million, respectively, from the sale of real estate assets and a residual property interest. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $39.3 million, $24.7 million and $22.2 million, respectively were received from the disposal of other property, plant and equipment. Property disposals relate primarily to ongoing renewal and replacements in the Global Services segment. The acquisition of Trend Western utilized cash of $33.0 million during 2004. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004 included capital expenditures of $274.1 million, $213.2 million and $104.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures include $35.5 million in 2006 and $23.9 million in 2005 for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in Texas, but otherwise relate primarily to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures over the past three years related largely to the ongoing renewal and replacement in the construction equipment operations, rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq in 2005 and 2004 and hurricane recovery in the United States during 2005. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, renewal and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. New engineering and construction joint ventures of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment in the United Kingdom during 2005 required capital contributions totaling approximately $30 million. During 2006, the company amended and restated its Senior Credit Facility, increasing the size from $800 million to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity to 2011. During 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the Notes) due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of the Aliso Viejo 35 engineering and corporate offices through payoff of the lease financing. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash if a specified trading price of the companys common stock (the trigger price) is achieved and maintained for a specified period and the Notes are presented by the holders for conversion. During the fourth quarter of 2005 and throughout 2006, the trigger price was achieved for the specified number of days and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The company does not know the amount, if any, of the Notes that will be presented for conversion, and will use available cash balances to satisfy any required repayments. In December 2004, the company filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the company subsequently entered into a distribution agreement for up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2005 the company sold 758,367 shares under this distribution agreement, realizing net proceeds of $41.8 million. No shares were issued in 2006 or 2004 under this distribution agreement. During 2006, non recourse project financing provided $127.3 million of financing cash flow. During 2005, an equity bridge loan and non recourse project financing provided $16.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively, of financing cash flow. These amounts relate to the consolidation of a joint venture, as discussed below under Non Recourse Project Financing. A warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares was exercised in 2006, yielding proceeds of $16.6 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $15.2 million, $50.6 million and $61.7 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares under certain market conditions. No purchases were made during 2006, 2005 or 2004. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. There is no present plan to purchase any shares under the existing program. In the first quarter of 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend payable April 3, 2006 to $0.20 per share. Subsequent dividends have continued at this rate. Quarterly cash dividends declared totaled $0.16 per share in both 2005 and 2004. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. However, for the dividend paid to shareholders as of January 3, 2006, payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of December 2005, resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter of 2005. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. During 2006 and 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. During 2005 the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar, and unrealized translation losses occurred. Unrealized gains of $10.3 million in 2006 and $40.0 million in 2004 and unrealized losses of $32.9 million in 2005 primarily relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. The company has sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating needs. Cash on hand, short and long term lines of credit and potential issuances of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statement give the company significant operating liquidity. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. 36 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (including contractual obligations) The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $2.1 billion in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or for performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2006, the company had utilized $686 million of its letter of credit capacity. In addition, the company has $107 million in uncommitted lines for general cash management purposes. The company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms, primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 330 $ 330 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 4.65% equity bridge loan 19 19 Non recourse project finance debt 193 23 46 73 51 Interest on all obligations(1) 44 17 10 7 10 Operating leases(2) 277 35 74 45 123 Pension minimum funding(3) 217 15 97 105 Other post employment benefits 49 6 13 11 19 Other compensation related obligations(4) 290 20 62 54 154 Guarantee of pollution control bonds 3 3 Total $ 1,440 $ 468 $ 302 $ 295 $ 375 (1) Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payment indicated in the above table. Interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted. (2) Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3) The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans based on the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (4) Principally deferred executive compensation. The company has a joint venture arrangement to design, build, finance and maintain an aircraft refueling facility at a United States Air Force base in Qatar for the Defense Energy Support Center, an agency of the Department of Defense. The company has a 27.5 percent interest in the joint venture company. On April 29, 2005, the joint venture entered into an agreement for project financing which includes a joint and several project completion guarantee by the members of the joint venture. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required under the guarantee is $76.5 million, the maximum principal amount available under the financing arrangement, plus any accrued interest. The facility has now been completed and was accepted by the customer in January 2007. Non Recourse Project Financing During 2005, the companys Industrial & Infrastructure segment was awarded a $544 million project by a joint venture, GeneSYS Telecommunications Limited (GeneSYS), which is consolidated in the companys consolidated financial statements. The project was entered into with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport (the Highways Agency) to design, build, maintain and finance a new integrated transmission network throughout Englands motorways. The project will be executed by GeneSYS in which the company owns a 45 percent interest and HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited, which owns a 55 percent interest. GeneSYS will finance the engineering and construction (E&C) of upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately $273 million 37 (140 million) of non recourse debt (the term loan facility) from a consortium of lenders (the Banks) along with joint venture member capital contributions totaling approximately $43 million (22 million). The equity contributions by the joint venture members have been provided through equity bridge loans from the Banks. The loans have been guaranteed or secured in proportion to each members equity participation. The equity bridge loans are repayable upon completion of the upgrade at which time the equity members are required to fund their contributions to the joint venture, which is expected to occur in 2007. Based on a qualitative analysis of the operations of GeneSYS and the variable interests of all parties to the arrangement, under the provisions of FIN 46 R the company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The companys 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GeneSYS and accordingly, the non recourse debt provided by the Banks totaling $192.8 million and $57.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in the 2006 amount is $23.4 million that will become payable in 2007. The term loan facility provides for interest only at LIBOR plus a margin of 95 basis points during construction of the upgraded facilities reducing to a margin of 90 basis points after completion of construction and continuing until fully repaid. Commitment fees are payable on unused portions of the facility. Payments commence in 2008 and are due in installments over the term of the services period ending in 2016. The term loan facility is an obligation of GeneSYS and will never be a debt obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. Accordingly, in the event of a default on the term loans, the lenders may only look to the resources of GeneSYS for repayment. The debt will never be repayable from assets of the company beyond its gross $19 million equity investment plus any un remitted profits in the venture. The contract has been segmented between the E&C and operations and maintenance (O&M) portions of the work to be performed. The E&C portion of the work is being accounted for using contract accounting revenue recognition principles. As of December 31, 2006, a total of $172.5 million of E&C revenue has been recognized, including $143.3 million during 2006, for which the related receivable is included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Revenue in connection with O&M services including on demand services will be recognized as earned through the life of the contract. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2006. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where cost exceeds the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. The carrying value of the liability for guarantees is not material. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment 38 which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2006, the company had extended financial guarantees on behalf of certain clients and other unrelated third parties totaling approximately $4.9 million. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. The companys presently outstanding debt instruments, except non recourse and associated equity bridge loan project finance debt, carry a fixed rate coupon. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on fixed rate debt is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations. Outstanding project finance debt is subject to a floating interest rate and, commercial paper, when outstanding, is issued at current short term interest rates, which could result in higher interest cost if such rates increase in the future. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2006, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 15 months duration, to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2006 was $242 million. During 2006 and 2004, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. During 2005, the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar, and unrealized translation losses occurred. Because it is expected that most of this cash will be used for project execution expenditures in the currency in which it is held, the exposure to realized translation gains or losses is mitigated.
