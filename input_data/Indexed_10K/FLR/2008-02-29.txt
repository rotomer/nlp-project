Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, "operating profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Consolidated revenue in 2007 was $16.7 billion compared with $14.1 billion in 2006. This increase is primarily the result of the 56 percent higher volume of work performed in the Oil & Gas segment in 2007 compared with 2006. The company believes that high demand in the global oil and gas industry is driving a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years. In addition, revenue increased in the Industrial & Infrastructure, Global Services and Power segments while the Government segment experienced a significant decline in revenue in 2007 compared with 2006. The revenue decline in the Government segment was primarily due to the substantial completion of environmental work on a large Department of Energy ("DOE") project and hurricane relief efforts for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") in 2006 and lower embassy and Iraq construction work in 2007. Revenue in the Power segment in 2007 increased significantly compared with 2006 primarily due to work on a coal fired power plant in Texas that was released for full execution in 2007. The company believes that the power market is entering an expansion phase due to higher demand for power generation facilities. Consolidated revenue in 2006 increased by 7 percent compared with 2005. This increase was the primary result of higher project execution activities in the Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments and work performed for support of FEMA for hurricane relief efforts that started in 2005. Earnings before taxes were $649 million in 2007, $382 million in 2006 and $300 million in 2005. Earnings before taxes for 2007 increased by 70 percent compared with 2006 primarily from the 44 percent overall improvement in business segment operating profit and a significant increase in net interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates in 2007. All business segments, except Government, had improvements in operating profit primarily due to increases in revenue from work performed. Operating Profit in the Government segment improved primarily due to the absence of charges associated with Embassy projects which significantly impacted results in 2006 as discussed below. Incentive and stock price based compensation expense, that is included in corporate administrative and general expense, was higher in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005. Earnings before taxes for 2006 increased by 28 percent compared with 2005. The Oil & Gas and Global Services segments reported higher operating profit benefiting from favorable conditions in oil and gas markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment returned to profitability in 2006 on improved project execution performance and the absence of provisions required in 2005 on certain projects in dispute resolution. Partially offsetting these operating profit improvements during 2006 was significantly lower operating profit from the Government segment. Operating profit was reduced primarily due to provisions totaling $183 million on fixed price projects in the Government segment which largely offset earnings from hurricane relief work for FEMA. The 2006 provisions were for losses on certain fixed price embassy projects totaling $154 million and the balance for the air base project in Afghanistan due to difficulties with a subcontractor. See further discussion of the embassy and Afghanistan provisions under Government below. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 17.8 percent which includes the impact of the final resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of a tax audit relating to tax years 1996 through 2000. The reduction in tax expense associated with the settlement totaled $123 million. The settlement lowered the effective tax rate for 2007 by 19 percentage points. The 2007 effective rate compares with effective rates of 23 31 percent and 24 percent for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Variability in effective tax rates in recent years and further discussion of the 2007 settlement with the IRS are discussed below under Corporate, Tax and Other Matters. The company had net earnings of $5.85 per share in 2007 compared with $2.95 per share in 2006 and $2.62 per share in 2005. The significant increase in 2007 earnings per share includes the impact of the $123 million ($1.35 per share) settlement with the IRS discussed above. Thus, earnings per share increased 53 percent in 2007 excluding the impact of the settlement compared with 2006. Consolidated new awards for 2007 were $22.6 billion, compared with $19.3 billion in 2006, and $12.5 billion in 2005. The Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments had increases in new awards during 2007, partially offset by decreases in new awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure segments had increases in new awards during 2006, partially offset by lower new awards in the Global Services, Government and Power segments. Approximately 53 percent of consolidated new awards for 2007 were for projects located outside of the United States. Consolidated backlog at December 31, 2007 of $30.2 billion has more than doubled over the last two years due to strong demand for capital investment in Oil & Gas markets and large awards in Industrial & Infrastructure and Power. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 56 percent of consolidated backlog relates to projects located outside of the United States. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see Segment Operations and Corporate and Tax Matters below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared with total estimated contract cost. This method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. Pre contract costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2007, 76 percent of the companys backlog is cost reimbursable while 24 percent is for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages. In addition, increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. 24 Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $246 million and $200 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable, but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, deferrals and revised project scope and cost, both upward and downward. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue, cost and operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Frequently, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles. Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46 R") provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46 R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 00 1, "Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures" ("EITF 00 1") and Statement of Position 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts" ("SOP 81 1"). The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46 R to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards, and will reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events. Deferred Taxes and Tax Contingencies Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2007, the company had deferred tax assets of $589 million which were partially 25 offset by a valuation allowance of $59 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $70 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries, certain reserves on investments, and certain foreign tax credit carryforwards. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. In the first quarter of 2007, the company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), an interpretation of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Also, the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $45 million, increasing its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties and reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. As of the date of adoption, including the impact of recognizing the increase in liability noted above, the companys unrecognized tax benefits totaled $351 million of which $166 million, if recognized, would affect the companys effective tax rate. The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2007, the accrual totaled $26 million for the potential payment of interest and penalties. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended ("SFAS 87"). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $50 million and $75 million for the calendar year 2008, which is expected to satisfy the minimum funding requirement. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $32 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("SFAS 158"). This statement amends SFAS 87 and requires that the funded status of plans, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the pension benefit obligations, be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic pension expense. The statement was adopted in 2006 and resulted in a $180 million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which reduced shareholders equity. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance ("EPCM") and is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil & Gas segment 26 provides design, engineering, procurement, construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides design, engineering, procurement and construction professional services for transportation projects, mining, life sciences facilities, telecommunications projects, manufacturing facilities, commercial and institutional, microelectronics and healthcare facilities. The Government segment provides engineering, construction, contingency response, management and operations services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance activities, small capital project engineering and execution, site equipment and tool services, industrial fleet outsourcing, plant turnaround services, temporary staffing and materials and subcontract procurement. The Power segment provides professional services to the gas fueled, solid fueled, renewables, nuclear and plant betterment marketplaces. Oil & Gas Revenue and operating profit for the Oil & Gas segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 8,369.9 $ 5,368.0 $ 5,291.2 Operating profit 432.7 305.7 242.0 Revenue in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005 has increased substantially as a result of higher levels of project execution activities from the significant levels of new project awards experienced over the last three years. Operating profit margin in the Oil & Gas segment was 5.2 percent in 2007 compared with 5.7 percent in 2006 and 4.6 percent in 2005. The operating margin in 2007 includes the impact of a higher volume of lower margin construction related activities as a number of large projects have moved from the engineering phase into on site execution. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $13.5 billion in 2007, $10.4 billion in 2006 and $4.4 billion in 2005. The world wide demand for oil and gas exploration and expansion of refining capacity continues at a high level. The segment is participating in this expanding market that includes very large projects in diverse geographical locations, which are very well suited for Fluors global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. New project awards in 2007 included a $2 billion award for the utility and offsite facilities for a new refinery in the Middle East and refinery expansion projects in Spain and the United States amounting to $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. New project awards in 2006 included a $1.8 billion refinery expansion in the United States, a $2.2 billion project in Saudi Arabia and a project in excess of $1.0 billion in Qatar. New project awards in 2005 included $1.3 billion for two large international petrochemical projects and $1.0 billion for a gas complex in the United Arab Emirates. Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $18.5 billion at December 31, 2007, up sequentially from $12.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2005. The 2007 and 2006 growth in backlog results principally from the continued strength of new awards and positive project scope related cost adjustments to existing projects. Total assets in the Oil & Gas segment increased to $891 million at December 31, 2007 from $629 million at December 31, 2006 and $575 million at December 31, 2005 primarily due to the continued increase in the level of project execution activities over the periods. 27  Industrial & Infrastructure Revenue and operating profit for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 3,385.0 $ 3,171.1 $ 3,200.4 Operating profit 101.0 76.4 (16.7 ) Revenue increased during 2007 compared with 2006 primarily as a result of continued strong execution activities on mining and infrastructure projects. Although revenue remained fairly constant for 2006 and 2005, the mix of new business in 2006 shifted somewhat from manufacturing facilities to large infrastructure and mining projects that generally have longer execution periods. Operating profit and margin percentages have increased during 2007 compared with 2006, largely on the strength of performance on mining and infrastructure projects. The improvement during 2006 compared with 2005 includes the favorable impacts of successful project performance, reduced provisions on disputed projects, improved margins on more recent projects and overhead spending reductions. Operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects. The segment participates in a 50/50 joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. The project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays, resulting in additional cost. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, provisions of $25 million, $30 million and $24 million, respectively, were recorded due to increasing estimated cost. The company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost, as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project. To date, the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately $155 million to the client. Cost of $101 million has been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of December 31, 2007 and the company has recognized its $51 million proportionate share of this cost in revenue including $22 million in 2007. The project opened to traffic in November 2007 and is expected to be completed in mid 2008. During 2007, the customer withheld liquidated damages totaling $49 million from amounts otherwise due the joint venture. The company believes that any amounts that are withheld for liquidated damages will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and has therefore not recognized any reduction in project revenue because of the withholdings. In addition to the charge in 2005 arising from the transportation infrastructure project discussed above, the segment recorded provisions totaling $82 million involving several other projects which contributed to the operating loss in that year. The provisions recognized included settlements involving projects that had been the subject of dispute resolution activities including two resort hotel projects and two life sciences projects. The projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company. Dispute resolution activities were concluded on these matters and settlements finalized during 2005. The company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its London Connect Project, a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the London Underground system. The company has recognized $42 million in 2007 and an aggregate of $116 million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to delay and disruption claims that are the subject of the arbitration proceedings. In addition, the company was assessed and has paid $54 million representing its share of liquidated damages. This payment has not been recognized as a reduction in project revenue because it is expected that amounts assessed will be substantially recovered upon resolution of the companys claims. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $3.4 billion during 2007, $4.5 billion in 2006 and $2.3 billion during 2005. New awards during 2007 continued to be concentrated in the mining sector and also included a $1.3 billion transportation infrastructure project in Virginia. New awards during 28 2006 increased across most of the segments business lines, with new mining projects representing approximately 45 percent of the total. The lower level of new awards in 2005 included the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards. Backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment increased to $6.1 billion at the end of 2007 from $5.4 billion at the end of 2006. For 2005, ending backlog was $3.9 billion. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $576 million, $686 million and $490 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in total assets from 2007 to 2006 is primarily due to the deconsolidation of the National Roads Telecommunication Services project in the United Kingdom. See Variable Interest Entities below for further discussion of this project. Government Revenue and operating profit for the Government segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 1,308.2 $ 2,859.9 $ 2,708.2 Operating profit 29.3 17.7 83.7 Revenue in the last three years includes reconstruction activity in Iraq and work for environmental restoration, engineering, construction, site operations and maintenance services at two major DOE sites: the Fernald Environmental Management Project ("Fernald") in Ohio, which was completed in 2006, and the ongoing Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington. Revenue during 2006 and 2005 also includes significant amounts relating to hurricane relief activities in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"). As expected, a substantial decrease in revenue occurred in 2007 compared with 2006. The decrease was primarily the result of the significant contributions from FEMA hurricane relief and the Fernald environmental project during the 2006 period. The Fernald contract is substantially complete and the volume of FEMA task orders was significantly lower in 2007 and the second half of 2006. Work in Iraq was also lower in 2007. The six percent increase in revenue in 2006 compared with 2005 resulted from the continuation of hurricane relief activities in support of FEMA, which commenced in the second half of 2005, partially offset by reduced Iraq reconstruction and DOE project activity. The level of FEMA activity increased during early 2006, but began to decline in the third and fourth quarters of the year, as the companys work on hurricane relief efforts was completed. The decline in DOE activity resulted largely from the completion of the Fernald project at the end of October 2006. Operating profit during 2007 and 2006 include provisions totaling $21 million and $29 million, respectively, on a fixed priced contract at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. These charges relate to subcontractor execution issues and liquidated damages due to the resulting delay in project completion. In addition, operating profit in 2006 was negatively impacted by loss provisions totaling $154 million on certain embassy projects. The company recognized provisions for estimated cost overruns on certain of the embassy projects totaling $56 million in 2005. The company has been performing work on 11 embassy projects over the last four years for the United States Department of State under fixed price contracts. These projects have been adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions, scope changes causing material deviations from the Standard Embassy Design, increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. As of December 31, 2007, all embassy projects were complete with the exception of the project in Haiti where periods of civil unrest have resulted in significant unanticipated schedule delays and cost increases. In addition, at the site in Haiti, increased cost has resulted from collapsible soil conditions, additional client imposed requirements, subsequent increases in material quantities and the availability and productivity of construction labor. As of December 31, 2007, the physical completion of the Haiti embassy has progressed to approximately 95 percent and is estimated to be completed in early 2008. 29 During 2007, claims for recovery of cost associated with requirements for additional security cleared labor on three of the embassies were settled. Claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified to date on three of the projects remain open and total approximately $59 million. As the first formal step in dispute resolution, the majority of these claims have now been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements. As of December 31, 2007, aggregate cost totaling $47 million relating to these claims has been incurred and recognized in revenue. Additional claims continue to be evaluated. New awards in the Government segment were $1.2 billion during 2007, compared with $2.2 billion during 2006 and $2.5 billion in 2005. Backlog and new awards in 2007 do not include amounts for the Logistics Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) IV contract, awarded in the second quarter, pending resolution of protest proceedings and subsequent award of task orders. The decrease in new awards in 2007 was due to the significant decrease in emergency response work for FEMA and reconstruction activities in Iraq. Many projects performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months for annually funded contracts. Backlog during 2007 decreased to $740 million from $840 million in 2006 and $1.4 billion in 2005. The decline in backlog in 2006 compared to 2005 is the result of progress towards completion on the Fernald and Iraq contracts. FEMA awards have generally been performed very quickly and therefore have not significantly impacted backlog from one period to the next. The company is no longer pursuing projects in the embassy market. Total assets in the Government segment were $285 million at December 31, 2007, down from $597 million at December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the billing and collection of substantially all of the previously unbilled fees on the Fernald project and progress towards completion on the FEMA and Iraq reconstruction contracts. During 2006, segment assets decreased from $905 million at December 31, 2005. This decrease was the principal result of progress towards completion on the FEMA and Iraq reconstruction contracts. Global Services Revenue and operating profit for the Global Services segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 2,460.0 $ 2,137.9 $ 1,577.7 Operating profit 201.4 152.4 113.7 The 2007 and 2006 increases in revenue reflect continued growth across the segments various service lines. The segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models. Operating profit increases for 2007 and 2006 reflect the strong business environment extending across most of Global Services markets. Additionally, in 2006, operating profit was favorably impacted by hurricane recovery activities. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 8.2 percent, 7.1 percent and 7.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The equipment, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue. Accordingly, new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only. In recent years, Global Services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from short duration operations and maintenance activities and from other business not reported in backlog. 30  New awards in the Global Services segment were $2.2 billion during 2007, $1.6 billion during 2006 and $2.2 billion during 2005. New awards during 2007 include new work and renewals for key clients. New awards in 2005 included two large multi year operations and maintenance awards. Backlog for the Global Services segment was $2.5 billion at December 31, 2007. During 2006, backlog for the Global Services segment declined to $2.3 billion, compared with $2.5 billion at the end of 2005. Contributing to the 2006 backlog decline was the execution in 2006 of a substantial portion of a fixed duration contract. Total assets in the Global Services segment increased to $856 million at December 31, 2007, up from $721 million at December 31, 2006 and $640 million at December 31, 2005 as the principal result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth. Power Revenue and operating profit for the Power segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 1,167.9 $ 541.6 $ 383.6 Operating profit 38.0 4.3 13.3 Revenue in 2007 increased compared to 2006 and 2005 primarily due to higher volume of work performed on a new project awarded in 2007 and continuing activities on projects awarded in 2006 and 2005. Revenue levels in 2006 and 2005 were negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in 2003. Operating profit margin in the Power segment increased to 3.3 percent during 2007 from 0.8 percent during 2006. The 2007 increase in operating profit is the result of higher levels of project execution activities. The lower 2006 operating profit was the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of a project dispute, a loss on another project, a concentration of projects that were in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market. The 2005 operating results include the negative impact of a loss on one project, partly offset by successful project close out activities on a number of other projects. Projects in the Power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution, but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. The power market is entering an expansion phase that the company believes will translate to higher operating performance for the segment. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount, but occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $2.2 billion in 2007 include a $1.7 billion award for the Oak Grove coal fired power units in Texas for Luminant, a unit of Energy Future Holdings Corporation. New awards of $635 million during 2006 included a plant retrofit project in South Carolina. New awards of $1.0 billion during 2005 included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in Kentucky and a 200 megawatt power plant in Nevada. Backlog for the Power segment increased to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2007 from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006 and from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting growth in the number of projects in progress. Total assets in the Power segment increased to $150 million at December 31, 2007 from $137 million at December 31, 2006 and $94 million at December 31, 2005, due to additional working capital associated with the higher level of project execution activities. 31 Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2007, corporate administrative and general expenses were $193.9 million, $178.8 million and $143.7 million, respectively. The increase in 2007 is primarily due to higher incentive and stock price based compensation cost as a result of the increase in the companys stock price. Corporate administrative and general expense includes non operating income of $2.6 million during 2007, non operating expense of $5 million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during 2006 and non operating income of $9 million for the year 2005. The 2005 amount relates primarily to gains from sales of portfolio properties including the corporate headquarters building discussed below. The 2006 increase in corporate administrative and general expense includes $13.1 million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard compared with 2005. Additionally, during 2006, expenses recorded with respect to the relocation of the corporate headquarters increased by $8.5 million. In May 2005, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from Southern California to the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. The relocation was completed in the second quarter of 2006. Approximately 120 employees in Southern California who did not relocate to Texas left the company. The cost of these employee displacements was accrued ratably starting in the third quarter of 2005 through the date of the employee departures. All other relocation and hiring cost was charged to expense as incurred. Total relocation cost included in corporate administrative and general expense was $14.2 million and $5.7 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The corporate facility in California was sold in 2005. The cost to construct the new Texas headquarters totaled $60 million and was funded from available cash resources including proceeds from the sale of the former headquarters facility. Net interest income was $40.5 million, $4.3 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net interest income significantly increased in 2007 primarily as a result of higher cash balances and interest rates during the year. The 2006 decrease was the net result of interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of 2006 that were required to support project execution activities, an increase in the interest rates on those commercial paper borrowings and the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt starting in the fourth quarter of 2005, partially offset by higher cash balances and investment interest rates during the second half of 2005. Higher interest income in 2005 related principally to larger available cash balances and higher short term interest rates. Tax The effective tax rates on the companys pretax earnings were 17.8 percent, 31.0 percent and 24.1 percent for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In connection with the IRS examination of the companys income tax returns for the tax years beginning November 1, 1995 through December 31, 2000, the IRS proposed numerous adjustments that, if sustained, would have resulted in significant additional taxes and penalties. The company filed protests with IRS Appeals contesting many of the proposed adjustments and reached an agreement with IRS Appeals, which was reviewed and approved in December 2007 by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. As a result of the IRS Appeals settlement, the company recognized a $123 million reduction to income tax expense in 2007. The 2006 effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of associated tax benefits, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes. The comparatively low 2005 tax rate was primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement for the 1993 through 1995 tax years with the Internal Revenue Service, tax benefits associated with the dividends made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA") as more fully discussed below and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns. These items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit. These aforementioned favorable tax rate variances were partially offset by the tax effect recorded on certain foreign earnings which the company had previously 32 planned to reinvest overseas indefinitely. During 2005, the company reviewed its intent with respect to such foreign earnings and decided to forego this permanent reinvestment plan. Accordingly, the 2005 tax rate reflects the U.S. tax effect on these earnings. The AJCA created a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate certain qualified foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction, subject to specific reinvestment guidelines and certain limitations. In August 2005, the companys Domestic Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") prepared pursuant to the AJCA was approved by the companys Chief Executive Officer. The Plan was ratified by the Executive Committee of the companys Board of Directors on August 29, 2005. In September 2005, approximately $89 million was repatriated from certain foreign subsidiaries of the company, including certain previously taxed income and the base year amount as provided under the repatriation provision of the AJCA. The results of operations for 2005 included a tax benefit of $3.8 million attributable to the dividends received deduction, net of the foreign tax credits given up in exchange for such deduction. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution Conex International v. Fluor Enterprises, Inc. In November 2006, a Jefferson County, Texas, jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of Conex International ("Conex") v. Fluor Enterprises Inc. ("FEI"), ruling in favor of Conex and awarding $98.8 million in damages related to a 2001 construction project. In 2001, Atofina (now part of Total Petrochemicals Inc.) hired Conex International to be the mechanical contractor on a project at Atofinas refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. FEI was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to Atofina on the project. There was no contract between Conex and FEI. Later in 2001 after the project was complete, Conex and Atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project. Conex sued FEI in September 2003 alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that FEI should pay Conex the balance of the extra work charges that Atofina did not pay in the settlement. Conex also asserted that FEI interfered with Conexs contract and business relationship with Atofina. The jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference. The company has appealed the decision and believes, based on the advice of counsel, that it is probable that any judgment based on this verdict would be overturned. The company strongly believes that the judgment based on this verdict is supported neither by the facts nor the law, and will pursue all possible avenues for reconsideration or appeal. Accordingly, the company did not recognize a charge reflecting the verdict amount. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. v. General Electric Company, et al In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric, a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint seeks damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Subsequent to a motion to compel arbitration of the matter, the company initiated arbitration proceedings in New York under the American Arbitration Association international rules. The evidentiary phase of the arbitration has been concluded. In January 2005 the arbitration panel indicated that it would be rendering its decision in two phases; the first to be a decision on entitlement and second, a decision on damages. On May 4, 2005 the arbitration panel issued a partial award on entitlement issues which confirmed Fluors entitlement to recovery of certain of its claims for cost incurred in construction of the plant. On April 10, 2007, the arbitration panel issued a partial final award stipulating the amount of entitlement to recovery of certain claims and awarding interest on the net amounts due Fluor. An award on the amount of interest due Fluor is expected in 2008. The company does not expect that the final resolution of the arbitration will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. As of December 31, 2007, a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process. These include an Infrastructure Joint Venture Project and the London Connect Project, which are discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure" and certain Embassy Projects, which are discussed above under " Government". 33  Financial Position and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was $905 million compared with $296 million in 2006 and $409 million in 2005. During 2007, cash generated by operating activities resulted from earnings sources and reduced working capital excluding cash, which includes the billing and collection of fees on the Fernald project. During 2006, cash generated by operating activities resulted primarily from earnings sources. The 2005 amount includes $245 million collected in connection with the close out of a project in Venezuela. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. The increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts begin, cash used in start up activities is recovered and cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress. As customer advances are used in project execution and not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. In the event there is net investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. While contributions to defined contribution plans have fluctuated over the past three years in response to increases in the number of eligible employees, contributions to the defined benefit plans have shown more variability, at $62 million in 2007 compared with $41 million in 2006 and $89 million in 2005. The large contributions in 2005 were due in part to the variability of actual returns on plan assets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits in most of the plans. One plan that was not fully funded in 2004 received a contribution totaling $60 million during 2005, which provided full funding to the level of accumulated benefits as of the end of that year. As of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 all plans were funded to the level of accumulated benefits. Cash flows from investing activities during 2005 included $45 million from the sale of real estate assets and a residual property interest. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, $60 million, $39 million and $25 million, respectively were received from the disposal of primarily construction equipment associated with the equipment operations in the Global Services segment. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2007, 2006 and 2005 included capital expenditures of $284 million, $274 million and $213 million, respectively. Expenditures during 2007 include significant amounts relating to equipment operations and investments in computer infrastructure upgrades. Capital expenditures include $36 million in 2006 and $24 million in 2005 for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in Texas, but otherwise relate primarily to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in these capital expenditures over the past three years related largely to the ongoing renewal and replacement in the construction equipment operations, investments in computer infrastructure upgrades, rental equipment to support reconstruction activity in Iraq in 2005 and hurricane recovery in the United States during 2005. Capital expenditures in future periods will include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, renewal and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. New engineering and construction joint ventures of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment in the United Kingdom during 2005 required capital contributions totaling approximately $30 million. During 2006, the company amended and restated its Senior Credit Facility, increasing the size from $800 million to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity to 2011. During 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due 2024, realizing net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off the 34 then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of engineering and corporate office facilities in California through payoff of the lease financing. Ownership of the Calgary, Canada facilities was also obtained during 2004 through the payoff of $28.6 million of lease financing using available Canadian cash balances. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash. Notes are convertible if the specified trading price of the companys common stock (the "trigger price") is achieved and maintained for a specified period. During the fourth quarter of 2005 and throughout 2006 and 2007, the trigger price was achieved for the specified number of days and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. During 2007, holders converted $22.8 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 251,731 shares of the companys common stock. The company does not know the timing or principal amount of the remaining Notes that may be presented for conversion in the future. Available cash balances will be used to satisfy any principal payments. Shares of the companys common stock will be issued to satisfy any appreciation between the conversion price and the market price on the date of conversion. In December 2004, the company filed a "shelf" registration statement for the issuance of up to $500 million of any combination of debt securities or common stock, the proceeds from which could be used for debt retirement, the funding of working capital requirements or other corporate purposes. Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the company subsequently entered into a distribution agreement for up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2005, the company sold 758,367 shares under this distribution agreement, realizing net proceeds of $41.8 million. No shares were issued in 2007 or 2006 under this distribution agreement. During 2007 and 2006, non recourse project financing provided $101.7 and $127.3 million of financing cash flow, respectively, related to the National Roads Telecommunications Services Project. During 2005, an equity bridge loan and non recourse project financing provided $16.8 million and $57.6 million, respectively, of financing cash flow. These amounts relate to the activities of a joint venture that was previously consolidated in the companys financial statements. See below under Variable Interest Entities National Roads Telecommunications Services Project for further discussion of this matter. A warrant for the purchase of 460,000 shares was exercised in 2006, yielding proceeds of $16.6 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of $12.5 million, $15.2 million and $50.6 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in open market or negotiated transactions. During 2007, 2,800 shares of company stock were repurchased by the company under its stock repurchase program. No purchases were made during 2006 or 2005. The maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 4.1 million shares. Quarterly cash dividends declared totaled $0.16 per share in 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend payable April 3, 2006 to $0.20 per share. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. However, for the dividend paid to shareholders as of January 3, 2006, payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of December 2005, resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend payable April 2, 2008 to $0.25 per share. The payment and level of future cash dividends will be subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. During 2007 and 2006, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. During 2005 the exchange rates for these currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar, and unrealized translation losses occurred. Unrealized gains of $53.8 million in 2007, $10.3 million in 2006 and unrealized losses of $32.9 million in 2005 primarily relate to cash balances held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 35 Because most of the cash held in foreign currencies will be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. Liquidity is provided by cash generated from operations, advance billings on contracts in progress and access to financial markets. As customer advances are reduced through use in project execution and if not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position could be reduced. For the next 12 months, cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of debt or equity securities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (including Contractual Obligations) The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $2.2 billion in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2007, the company had utilized $994 million of its credit capacity. In addition, the company has $113 million in credit lines for general purposes in addition to the amount above. The company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms, primarily on state and local government projects to guarantee its performance on contracts. Contractual Obligations at December 31, 2007 are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years $ in millions Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 307 $ 307 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Interest on debt obligations(1) 16 6 2 2 6 Operating leases(2) 306 48 97 53 108 Uncertain tax contingencies(3) 73 73 Joint venture contributions 27 3 6 17 1 Pension minimum funding(4) 234 17 104 113 Other post employment benefits 47 6 13 11 17 Other compensation related obligations(5) 354 47 65 47 195 Total $ 1,382 $ 434 $ 287 $ 243 $ 418 (1)Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payment indicated in the above table. Interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted. (2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3)Uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the "Over 5 years" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. (4)The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans based on the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (5)Principally deferred executive compensation. 36 Variable Interest Entities National Roads Telecommunications Services ("NRTS") Project In 2005, the companys Industrial & Infrastructure segment was awarded a $544 million project by a joint venture, GeneSYS Telecommunications Limited ("GeneSYS"), in which the company owns a 45 percent interest and HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited owns a 55 percent interest. The project was entered into with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport (the "Highways Agency") to design, build, maintain and finance a significant upgrade to the integrated transmission network throughout Englands motorways. GeneSYS financed the engineering and construction ("E&C") of the upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately $279 million of non recourse debt (the "term loan facility") from a consortium of lenders (the "Banks") along with joint venture member equity contributions and subordinated debt which were financed during the construction period utilizing equity bridge loans from outside lenders. During September 2007, the joint venture members paid their required permanent financing commitments in the amount of $44 million and were issued Subordinated Notes by GeneSYS. These funds were used by GeneSYS to repay the temporary construction term financing including the companys equity bridge loan. In early October 2007, the newly constructed network achieved operational status and was fully accepted by the Highways Agency on December 20, 2007, thereby concluding the E&C phase and entering the operations and maintenance phase of the project. Based on a qualitative analysis of the variable interests of all parties involved at the formation of GeneSYS, under the provisions of FIN 46 R, the company was initially determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The companys consolidated financial statements included the accounts of GeneSYS, and, accordingly, the non recourse debt provided by the Banks from the inception of the venture. Effective October 1, 2007, the company no longer consolidates the accounts of GeneSYS because it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. FIN 46 R requires that the initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity ("VIE") shall be reconsidered under certain conditions. One of those conditions is when the entitys governing documents or contractual arrangements are changed in a manner that changes the characteristics or adequacy of the entitys equity investment at risk. Such an event occurred in September 2007 upon the infusion of capital by the joint venture members which resulted in permanent financing through issuance of Subordinated Notes by GeneSYS that replaced the temporary equity bridge loans that had been provided by outside lenders. This refinancing of temporary debt with permanent debt constituted a change in the governing documents of GeneSYS that required reconsideration of GeneSYS as a variable interest entity. Based on the new capitalization structure of GeneSYS, the adequacy of the equity at risk in GeneSYS was evaluated and found to be inadequate to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support. Accordingly, upon reconsideration, GeneSYS continues to be a variable interest entity. Because the company holds a variable interest in the entity through its equity and debt investments, a qualitative evaluation was undertaken to determine if it was the primary beneficiary. In this evaluation, the company considered all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests based on the contractual arrangements existing at the time of reconsideration. Based on this evaluation, the company has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of GeneSYS. Accordingly, GeneSYS is not consolidated in the companys accounts at December 31, 2007 and is being accounted for on the equity method of accounting. The companys maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in GeneSYS is its aggregate $20 million equity and debt investment plus any un remitted earnings. The term loan is an obligation of GeneSYS and will never be a debt repayment obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. 37 Interstate 495 Capital Beltway Project In December 2007, the company was awarded the $1.3 billion Interstate 495 Capital Beltway high occupancy toll ("HOT") lanes project in Virginia. The project is a public private partnership between the Virginia Department of Transportation ("VDOT") and Capital Beltway Express LLC, a joint venture in which the company has a ten percent interest and Transurban (USA) Inc. has a 90 percent interest ("Fluor Transurban"). Under the agreement, VDOT will own and oversee the addition of traffic lanes, interchange improvements and construction of HOT lanes on 14 miles of the I 495 Capital Beltway in northern Virginia. Fluor Transurban, as concessionaire, will develop, design, finance, construct, maintain and operate the improvements and HOT lanes under an 80 year concession agreement. The construction will be financed through grant funding from VDOT, non recourse borrowings from issuance of public tax exempt bonds, a non recourse loan from the Federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act (TIFIA) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation and equity contributions from the joint venture members. The construction of the improvements and HOT lanes will be performed by a construction joint venture in which the company has a 65 percent interest and Lane Construction has a 35 percent interest ("Fluor Lane"). Transurban (USA) Inc. will perform the operations and maintenance upon completion of the improvements and commencement of operations of the toll lanes. Fluor Transurban has been determined to be a variable interest entity under the provisions of FIN 46 R. Pursuant to the requirements of the Interpretation, the company evaluated its interest in Fluor Transurban including its project execution obligations and risks relating to its interest in Fluor Lane and has determined based on a qualitative analysis that it is not the primary beneficiary of Fluor Transurban. The companys maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in Fluor Transurban is its $35 million aggregate equity investment commitment, of which $9 million has been funded, plus any un remitted earnings. The company will never have repayment obligations associated with any of the debt because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. The company will account for its ownership interest in Fluor Transurban on the equity method of accounting. The company will fully consolidate Fluor Lane in its consolidated financial statements. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totals $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. The carrying value of the liability for guarantees is not material. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. There are no material guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2007. 38  Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities, primarily time deposits, that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. All of the companys long term debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on fixed rate debt is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. The company generally utilizes currency options and forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business and does not engage in currency speculation. At December 31, 2007, the company had forward foreign exchange contracts of less than 8 months duration, to exchange major world currencies. The total gross notional amount of these contracts at December 31, 2007 was $65 million. During 2007, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income.
