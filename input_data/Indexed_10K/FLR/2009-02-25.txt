Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, "operating profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Consolidated revenue in 2008 increased to $22.3 billion compared to $16.7 billion in 2007. While all business segments contributed to the increase in revenue in 2008, the Oil & Gas segment was the primary driver, growing by 55 percent when compared to the prior year. Over the past several years, the company has benefited from the long term growth in global demand for oil and gas and the capital spending of our clients to support this growth. However, the global credit crisis and falling oil prices have reduced the demand for oil and gas, which is impacting the near term capital investment plans of some of our Oil & Gas clients. Similarly, the companys other business segments could be impacted by the global recession and credit crisis. Consolidated revenue in 2007 increased by 18 percent when compared to 2006, primarily due to the 56 percent higher volume of work performed in the Oil & Gas segment and higher project execution activities in the Industrial & Infrastructure, Global Services and Power segments. Revenue for the Power segment increased in 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to work on a coal fired power plant in Texas that was released for full execution in 2007. Revenue for the Government segment declined in 2007 when compared to 2006 due to lower embassy and Iraq construction work in 2007 and the substantial completion of environmental work on a large Department of Energy ("DOE") project and hurricane relief efforts for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") in 2006. Earnings before taxes were $1.1 billion in 2008, $649 million in 2007 and $382 million in 2006. Earnings before taxes for 2008 increased 72 percent compared to 2007 primarily as a result of a 61 percent improvement in business segment operating profit. All business segments experienced improvements in operating profit due to increases in the level of project execution activities. The 2008 operating profit of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment included a pre tax gain from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the United Kingdom partially offset by provisions for a fixed price telecommunications project in the United Kingdom, both discussed under " Industrial & Infrastructure" below. The 2008 operating profit of the Government segment also improved compared to the prior year due to the absence of charges associated with the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan which negatively impacted the operating performance of the segment in 2007, as discussed under " Government" below. The 2008 operating profit of the Power segment included a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable, discussed under " Power" below. The improved operating performance of the business segments in 2008 was offset somewhat by higher corporate general and administrative expense, including higher compensation related costs and a loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the United Kingdom. Earnings before taxes in 2008 were also higher when compared to 2007 due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the reduction of outstanding principal resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in 2008. Earnings before taxes for 2007 increased by 70 percent compared to 2006 primarily from the 44 percent overall improvement in business segment operating profit and a significant increase in net interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates in 2007. All business segments, except Government, had improvements in operating profit primarily due to increases in revenue from work performed. Operating profit in the Government segment improved primarily due to the absence of charges 24 associated with certain embassy projects which significantly impacted results in 2006, as discussed below. Incentive and stock price based compensation expense, which is included in corporate administrative and general expense, was higher in 2007 compared to 2006. Net interest income increased significantly in 2007 primarily as a result of higher cash balances and interest rates during the year. The effective tax rate for 2008 was 35.4 percent which includes a favorable benefit resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances, statute expirations and tax settlements. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 17.8 percent and 31.0 percent, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2007 includes the impact of the final resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of a tax audit relating to tax years 1996 through 2000. The reduction in tax expense associated with the settlement totaled $123 million. The settlement lowered the effective tax rate for 2007 by 19 percentage points. Variability in effective tax rates in recent years is discussed below under " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters." The company had net earnings of $3.93 per share in 2008 compared to $2.93 per share in 2007 and $1.48 per share in 2006. The 34 percent increase in 2008 earnings per share is primarily the result of increases in the level of project execution activities and includes the pre tax gain of $79 million ($0.27 per share) from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment. The significant increase in 2007 earnings per share includes the impact of increased project execution activities and the $123 million ($0.68 per share) settlement with the IRS discussed above. Excluding the impact of the settlement, 2007 earnings per share increased 52 percent compared to 2006. Consolidated new awards for 2008 were $25.1 billion, compared to $22.6 billion in 2007, and $19.3 billion in 2006. The increase in new award activity in 2008 was primarily attributable to the Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure segments, partially offset by lower new awards for Power. The Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments had increases in new awards during 2007, partially offset by decreases in new awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. Approximately 45 percent of consolidated new awards for 2008 were for projects located outside of the United States. Consolidated backlog was $33.2 billion at December 31, 2008, $30.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and $21.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The trend of growing backlog is primarily attributable to strong demand for capital investment in Oil & Gas markets and large awards in Industrial & Infrastructure. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 50 percent of consolidated backlog relates to projects located outside of the United States. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see " Segment Operations" and " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Contracts are segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, and accordingly, gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered. The percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to 25 prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. Pre contract costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. In the highly competitive markets served by the company, there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. As of December 31, 2008, 75 percent of the companys backlog is cost reimbursable while 25 percent is for guaranteed maximum, fixed or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages. In addition, increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions. The company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $202 million and $246 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable, but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis. Under this method of accounting, the company consolidates its proportionate share of venture revenue, cost and operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Generally, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles. Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46(R)") provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. FIN 46(R) requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys 26 residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, "Disclosures about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities" which requires additional disclosures by public companies with variable interests in variable interest entities. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 00 1, "Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures" ("EITF 00 1") and Statement of Position 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts" ("SOP 81 1"). The company evaluates the applicability of FIN 46(R) to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards, and will reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events. Deferred Taxes and Tax Contingencies Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2008, the company had deferred tax assets of $602 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $40 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $27 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The allowance for 2008 primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. In the first quarter of 2007, the company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), an interpretation of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Also, the interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $45 million, increasing its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties and reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended ("SFAS 87"). As permitted by SFAS 87, changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $40 million and $60 million for the calendar year 2009, which is expected to be substantially in excess of the minimum funding required. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $28 million. 27 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("SFAS 158"). This statement amends SFAS 87 and requires that the funded status of plans, measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the pension benefit obligations, be recognized in the statement of financial position and that various items be recognized in other comprehensive income before they are recognized in periodic pension expense. The statement was adopted in 2006 and resulted in a $180 million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss, which reduced shareholders equity. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management. The company is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. The Oil & Gas segment provides design, engineering, procurement, construction and project management professional services for upstream oil and gas production, downstream refining and certain integrated petrochemical markets. The Industrial & Infrastructure segment provides design, engineering, procurement and construction professional services for transportation, wind power, mining and metals, life sciences, telecommunications, manufacturing, commercial and institutional development, microelectronics and healthcare clients. The Government segment provides engineering, construction, contingency response, management and operations services to the United States government. The Global Services segment includes operations and maintenance activities, small capital project engineering and execution, site equipment and tool services, industrial fleet outsourcing, plant turnaround services, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions. The Power segment provides engineering, procurement, construction, program management, start up and commissioning and maintenance services to the gas fueled, solid fueled, renewables, emerging nuclear and plant betterment markets. Oil & Gas Revenue and operating profit for the Oil & Gas segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 12,946.3 $ 8,369.9 $ 5,368.0 Operating profit 723.8 432.7 305.7 Both revenue and operating profit increased substantially in 2008 when compared to both 2007 and 2006 as a result of continued growth in project execution activities from the significant levels of new project awards over the last few years. Operating profit margin for the segment was 5.6 percent in 2008 compared to 5.2 percent in 2007 and 5.7 percent in 2006. Operating profit margin in 2008 is comparatively higher than in 2007 for a number of reasons, including the performance of certain large projects in the engineering phase which typically generate higher margins than projects in the construction phase and improved contributions from other projects of the segment. The operating margin in 2007 includes the impact of a higher volume of lower margin construction related activities as a number of large projects moved from the engineering phase into on site execution. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $15.1 billion in 2008, $13.5 billion in 2007 and $10.4 billion in 2006. The high worldwide demand for new capacity in oil and gas exploration and refining, as well as polysilicon, has driven the increase in new project awards. New awards in 2008 included two refinery expansion projects in the United States valued at $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion, and a $1.0 billion polysilicon project in China. New awards in 2007 included a $2.0 billion award for the utility and offsite facilities for a new refinery in the Middle East and refinery expansion projects in Spain and the United States amounting to $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. New awards in 2006 included a $1.8 billion refinery expansion in the United States, a $2.2 billion project in Saudi Arabia and a project in excess of $1.0 billion in Qatar. 28 Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $21.4 billion at December 31, 2008, up sequentially from $18.5 billion at December 31, 2007 and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The 2008 and 2007 growth in backlog is primarily due to the continued strength of new award activity and positive scope related cost adjustments to existing projects. The segment has been a participant in an expanding market that includes very large projects in diverse geographical locations, which are well suited to the companys global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. However, the global credit crisis and falling oil prices have resulted in some clients reassessing their capital spending plans for 2009. As such, there is some uncertainty as to the sustainability of the high growth and operating profit margins recently experienced by the segment. Total assets in the segment increased to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2008 from $891 million at December 31, 2007 and $629 million at December 31, 2006 primarily due to the continued increase in the level of project execution activities over the periods. Industrial & Infrastructure Revenue and operating profit for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 3,470.3 $ 3,385.0 $ 3,171.1 Operating profit 208.2 101.0 76.4 Revenue in 2008 improved slightly from 2007 on the strength of the mining and metals and manufacturing and life sciences business lines. Revenue increased during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of project execution activities on mining and infrastructure projects. The 2008 revenue growth for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment has been accompanied by substantial operating profit and operating profit margin increases, primarily as the result of improved performance in mining and a pre tax gain of $79 million from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the United Kingdom. The higher margins for the mining and metals business line in 2008 are largely attributable to an increase in the mix of engineering and consulting projects, which typically generate higher margins than projects in the construction phase. The segments ability to command more favorable pricing due to its capabilities and project execution performance, along with industry wide resource constraints, also contributed to the higher mining margins in 2008. Operating profit and operating profit margin increased during 2007 compared to 2006, largely on the strength of performance on mining and infrastructure projects. Operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by loss provisions relating to specific projects. Looking ahead, the segment could be impacted by the global credit crisis and falling commodity prices, as some clients, particularly in the mining and metals business line, are reassessing their capital spending programs for 2009. Projects originally planned for 2009 could be delayed or canceled. The company is involved in dispute resolution proceedings in connection with its London Connect Project, a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows transmission and reception throughout the London Underground system. The project, which is now complete, has been subject to significant delays by the owner, resulting in additional cost to the company and claims against the client. The company has recognized an aggregate of $105 million in claims revenue relating to incurred costs attributed to delay and disruption claims that are part of the dispute resolution proceedings, reduced for settlement amounts. Total claims related cost incurred to date and the value of the claims submitted or identified exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue. In addition, the client withheld $54 million representing the companys share of liquidated damages, a substantial portion of which has been reserved for possible non collection. During 2008, provisions of $33 million were 29 recognized as the result of reassessments of the remaining time and cost to complete the project and the probability of recovery of liquidated damages and certain claims. The company participates in a 50/50 joint venture that is completing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. The project continues to be subject to circumstances resulting in additional cost including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays. The company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project cost, as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project. During 2007 and 2006, provisions of $25 million and $30 million, respectively, were recognized due to increases in estimated cost. The company continues to incur legal expenses associated with the claims and dispute resolution process. As of December 31, 2008, the company has recognized in cost and revenue its $52 million proportionate share of $104 million of cost relating to claims recognized by the joint venture. Total claims related costs incurred, as well as claims submitted to the client by the joint venture, are in excess of the $104 million of recognized cost. As of December 31, 2008, the client withheld liquidated damages totaling $51 million from amounts otherwise due the joint venture and has asserted additional claims against the joint venture. The company believes that the claims against the joint venture are without merit and that amounts withheld will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and has, therefore, not recognized any reduction in project revenue for its $25.5 million proportionate share of the withheld liquidated damages. In addition, the client has drawn down $14.8 million against letters of credit provided by the company and its joint venture partner. The company believes that the amounts drawn down against the letters of credit will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and, as such, has not reserved for the possible non recovery of the companys $7.4 million proportionate share. The project opened to traffic in November 2007 and is expected to be completed in the spring of 2009. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $5.0 billion during 2008, $3.4 billion during 2007, and $4.5 billion in 2006. New awards during 2008 reflected a substantial increase in the mining and metals business line and also included a $1.8 billion infrastructure project in the United Kingdom. New awards during 2007 were also concentrated in the mining sector and included a $1.3 billion transportation infrastructure project in Virginia. New awards during 2006 increased across most of the segments business lines, with new mining projects representing approximately 45 percent of the total. Ending backlog for the segment increased to $6.7 billion for 2008 from $6.1 billion for 2007 and $5.4 billion for 2006. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $536 million at December 31, 2008, largely comparable to the $576 million of total assets at December 31, 2007. Total assets at December 31, 2006 were $686 million and included the consolidation of the National Roads Telecommunication Services project in the United Kingdom, which was deconsolidated in 2007. Government Revenue and operating profit for the Government segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 1,319.9 $ 1,308.2 $ 2,859.9 Operating profit 52.2 29.3 17.7 Revenue in 2008 increased slightly compared to revenue in 2007 primarily due to the start up of the Savannah River Site Management and Operating Project in South Carolina ("Savannah River") which offsets reduced contributions from the embassy projects and Iraq related work. Other contributors to 2008 revenue include continued support for the public assistance program in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"), the Hanford Environmental Management Project in Washington and work that began in late 2008 in support of Logistics Augmentation Program ("LOGCAP IV") task orders for the United States Army in Afghanistan. The substantial decrease in revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 30 was primarily attributable to significantly reduced contributions from FEMA hurricane relief task orders, Iraq related work and the Fernald project that was completed in October 2006. Operating profit for the Government segment during 2008 increased significantly compared to 2007 and 2006, primarily due to the absence of significant provisions for loss projects that had been made in the earlier two years. Operating profit in 2008 was also favorably impacted by work that began at the Savannah River project and for LOGCAP IV task orders. Provisions totaling $21 million and $29 million were made in 2007 and 2006, respectively, on a fixed priced contract at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. These charges related to subcontractor execution issues and liquidated damages due to the resulting delay in project completion. During 2008, the Bagram project was completed and various disputed items and warranty issues were resolved. As a result, $5 million was recognized in operating profit during the year. The remaining disputed items and warranty obligations are expected to be addressed in 2009. Operating profit in 2006 was negatively impacted by loss provisions for estimated cost overruns totaling $154 million on certain embassy projects. Provisions totaling $56 million had been previously recognized in 2005. The company has performed work on 11 embassy projects over the last five years for the United States Department of State under fixed price contracts. These projects were adversely impacted by higher cost due to schedule extensions, scope changes causing material deviations from the Standard Embassy Design, increased cost to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. As of December 31, 2008, all embassy projects were complete, with some warranty items still pending. As of December 31, 2008, aggregate cost totaling $45 million relating to claims on three of the embassy projects has been recognized in revenue. Total claims related cost incurred to date, along with claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified, exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue. As the first formal step in dispute resolution, all of these claims have been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements. The company continues to periodically evaluate its position with respect to these claims. New awards in the Government segment were $1.4 billion during 2008, compared to $1.2 billion during 2007 and $2.2 billion during 2006. The increase in new awards in 2008 was driven by the start up of the Savannah River project and the first task orders issued to the company under LOGCAP IV. The Savannah River projects transitional work and first full year of operations were included as a new award in 2008. The company reports new awards for LOGCAP IV as individual task orders are awarded and funded. The decrease in new awards in 2007 was due to the significant decrease in emergency response work for FEMA and reconstruction activities in Iraq. Many projects, like Savannah River, are performed on behalf of U.S. government clients under multi year contracts and provide for annual funding. As a result, new awards for the Government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing 12 months for annually funded contracts. Backlog for the Government segment was $804 million at December 31, 2008, $740 million at December 31, 2007 and $840 million at December 31, 2006. The decline in backlog in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to progress toward completion on Iraq contracts. Total assets in the Government segment were $326 million at December 31, 2008, $285 million at December 31, 2007 and $597 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in total assets from the end of 2006 was primarily due to the billing and collection of substantially all of the previously unbilled fees on the Fernald project and progress towards completion on the FEMA and Iraq reconstruction contracts. 31  Global Services Revenue and operating profit for the Global Services segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 2,675.8 $ 2,460.0 $ 2,137.9 Operating profit 229.3 201.4 152.4 The 2008 increase in revenue reflects continued growth across most of the Global Services segments various business lines. The operations and maintenance business line experienced broad based growth in the majority of its markets during 2008, but its results were unfavorably impacted by delays in refinery turnarounds and hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The 2007 revenue increase was driven primarily by growth in the operations and maintenance business line. The segment continues to implement a disciplined growth strategy through widespread expansion of existing core competencies and regional deployment of new services and business models. Operating profit and operating profit margin increases for 2008 and 2007 reflect the strong business environment that has extended across most of Global Services markets. Additionally, operating profit in 2006 was favorably impacted by hurricane recovery activities. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Global Services began to be impacted by the current global economic downturn, particularly for natural resource prospects. The drop in commodity prices has caused delays of work originally planned for 2008 and 2009. Operating profit margin in the Global Services segment was 8.6 percent, 8.2 percent, and 7.1 percent for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise Global Services backlog. The equipment, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards. In recent years, Global Services has derived larger percentages of its revenue and operating profit from these non backlog reporting business lines and from short duration operations and maintenance activities. Therefore, Global Services revenue and profit increases may outpace backlog growth. New awards in the Global Services segment were $2.1 billion during 2008, $2.2 billion during 2007 and $1.6 billion during 2006. New awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients. Backlog for the Global Services segment was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2008, $2.5 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2006. Total assets in the Global Services segment were $763 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $856 million at December 31, 2007 and $721 million at December 31, 2006. The decrease in total assets in 2008 was due to the reduction in working capital in the equipment, supply chain solutions and operations and maintenance business lines. The increase in assets in 2007 was primarily the result of investments in equipment and working capital to support revenue growth. Power Revenue and operating profit for the Power segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 1,913.6 $ 1,167.9 $ 541.6 Operating profit 75.4 38.0 4.3 Revenue in 2008 and 2007 increased substantially as the result of higher levels of project execution activities from projects awarded over the last few years, including the Oak Grove coal fired power project in Texas for Luminant, a unit of Energy Futures Holdings Corporation, that was awarded in the second 32 quarter of 2007. Revenue levels in 2006 were negatively impacted by the reduced level of construction of new power plants following the completion of the most recent building cycle in 2003. Operating profit margin in the Power segment increased to 3.9 percent during 2008 from 3.3 percent during 2007 and 0.8 percent during 2006. Operating profit and operating profit margin increased in 2008 and 2007 as a result of higher levels of project execution activities, including the Oak Grove project. In addition, the operating profit margin in 2008 reflects higher margin front end services in the nuclear business line. Also reflected in 2008 operating profit, but as a partial offset to the drivers of margin improvement, was a fourth quarter provision for an uncollectible retention receivable of $9 million for the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia, discussed in more detail under Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution below. The lower 2006 operating profit and operating profit margin were the combined result of a charge associated with the final resolution of a project dispute, a loss on another project, a concentration of projects that were in the early stages where profit recognition is generally lower and higher overhead spending in anticipation of increasing revenue in an expanding market. Projects in the Power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis. This method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution, but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays. The Power segment has been impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants due to concerns over carbon emissions. In addition, power producers have been impacted by the global credit crisis. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount, but occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $1.3 billion in 2008 include a gas fired power plant in Texas, expansions to an existing emissions control retrofit program in Kentucky and an emissions control retrofit program in Texas for Luminant. New awards of $2.2 billion in 2007 included $1.7 billion for the Oak Grove award. New awards of $635 million during 2006 included a plant retrofit project in South Carolina. Backlog for the Power segment was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008, $2.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in backlog since December 31, 2006 is largely due to the 2007 new award for the Oak Grove project. Total assets in the Power segment were $130 million at December 31, 2008, $150 million at December 31, 2007 and $137 million at December 31, 2006. Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, corporate administrative and general expenses were $229 million, $194 million and $179 million, respectively. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to higher compensation related costs and a $16 million loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the United Kingdom. These increases in 2008 corporate administrative and general expenses are offset somewhat by foreign currency gains. Corporate administrative and general expense includes $17 million of non operating expense in 2008, of which $16 million is for the loss on the sale of the building and associated legal entity discussed above, compared to non operating income of $3 million during 2007 and non operating expense of $5 million relating principally to an investment impairment provision during 2006. The increase in corporate administrative and general expenses in 2007 from 2006 is primarily due to higher incentive and stock based compensation cost as a result of the increase in the value of the companys stock. The 2006 amount includes $13 million from the adoption of the new share based compensation accounting standard and $14 million of expenses related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters from Southern California to the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area that was completed in the second quarter of 2006. Net interest income was $55 million, $41 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net interest income increased in 2008 primarily due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the reduction of outstanding principal resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in 2008. Net interest income increased significantly in 2007 primarily as a result of higher cash balances and 33 interest rates during the year. The 2006 amount includes interest expense on outstanding commercial paper balances during the first six months of 2006 that were required to support project execution activities and interest expense from the consolidation of non recourse project finance debt during the year. Though the company is expected to continue to maintain high cash and marketable securities positions in 2009, lower interest rates could significantly reduce interest income. Tax The effective tax rates on the companys pretax earnings were 35.4 percent, 17.8 percent and 31.0 percent for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by the reversal of certain valuation allowances of $19 million and statute expirations and tax settlements of $28 million. The lower effective rate in 2007 was due to the reduction of income tax expense for the year as the result of an IRS Appeals settlement in connection with the IRS examination of the companys income tax returns for the period November 1, 1995 through December 31, 2000. The 2006 effective tax rate includes a favorable benefit resulting from the extraterritorial income exclusion and the reversal of certain valuation allowances, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of tax rate changes on certain state deferred taxes. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution Conex International v. Fluor Enterprises, Inc. In November 2006, a Jefferson County, Texas, jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of Conex International ("Conex") v. Fluor Enterprises Inc. ("FEI"), ruling in favor of Conex and awarding $99 million in damages related to a 2001 construction project. In 2001, Atofina (now part of Total Petrochemicals Inc.) hired Conex International to be the mechanical contractor on a project at Atofinas refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. FEI was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to Atofina on the project. There was no contract between Conex and FEI. Later in 2001 after the project was complete, Conex and Atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project. Conex sued FEI in September 2003 alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that FEI should pay Conex the balance of the extra work charges that Atofina did not pay in the settlement. Conex also asserted that FEI interfered with Conexs contract and business relationship with Atofina. The jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference. The company appealed the decision and the judgment against the company was reversed in its entirety in December 2008 and remanded for a new trial. Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. v. General Electric Company, et al In October 1998, Fluor Daniel International and Fluor Arabia Ltd. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against General Electric Company and certain operating subsidiaries as well as Saudi American General Electric ("SAMGE"), a Saudi Arabian corporation. The complaint sought damages in connection with the procurement, engineering and construction of the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. On April 10, 2007, the arbitration panel issued a partial final award stipulating the amount of entitlement to recovery of certain claims and awarding interest on the net amounts due to Fluor. A final award on the calculation of interest due to Fluor has been received. All amounts have been collected except for post award, pre judgment interest of approximately $1 million and a retention receivable of $9 million to be paid by SAMGE after it receives payment from the owner. In the fourth quarter of 2008, a provision was recognized for the full amount of the unpaid retention receivable as the result of a re assessment by the company of the likelihood that SAMGE would ever receive payment from the owner. 34  Fluor Corporation v. Citadel Equity Fund Ltd. Citadel Equity Fund Ltd., a hedge fund and investor in the companys 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes"), and the company are disputing the calculation of the number of shares of the companys common stock that were due to Citadel upon conversion of approximately $58 million of Notes. Citadel argues that it is entitled to an additional $28 million in value under its proposed calculation method. The company believes that the payout given to Citadel was proper and correct and that Citadels claims are without merit. The company is vigorously defending its position. Other As of December 31, 2008, a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process. These include an Infrastructure Joint Venture Project and the London Connect Project, which are discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure" and certain Embassy Projects, which are discussed above under " Government". Financial Position and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was $951 million compared to $905 million in 2007 and $296 million in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities during 2008, 2007 and 2006 resulted primarily from earning sources and increases in customer advance billings. Cash generated by operating activities in 2007 also includes the billing and collection of fees on the Fernald project. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects. The increase in new awards over the last three years will continue to result in periodic start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on individual projects and client payments on invoiced amounts increase, cash used in start up activities is recovered and project cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Liquidity is also provided by substantial advance billings on contracts in progress. As customer advances are used in project execution and if they are not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position will be reduced. In the event there is net new investment in operating assets that exceeds available cash balances the company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any periodic net operating cash outflows. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Contributions into the defined contribution plans of $98 million during 2008 have increased compared to $74 million in 2007 and $59 million in 2006 as a result of increases in the number of eligible employees. The company contributed $190 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2008, as a result of adverse conditions in the financial markets coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to maintain or achieve full funding of accumulated benefits. The company contributed $62 million and $41 million into its defined benefits plans during 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 all plans were funded to the level of accumulated benefits. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2008 include proceeds of $79 million from the sale of a joint venture interest in a wind power project in the United Kingdom. In addition, cash flows provided by investing activities during 2008 include $48 million primarily related to the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment operations in the Global Services segment compared with $60 million and $39 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2008, 2007 and 2006 included capital expenditures of $300 million, $284 million and $274 million, respectively. Expenditures during 2008 and 2007 included significant amounts relating to equipment operations and investments in computer infrastructure upgrades. Capital expenditures during 2006 included $36 million for construction of the new corporate headquarters facility in Texas, but otherwise relate primarily to the equipment operations in the Global Services segment that support engineering and construction projects. The increase in capital expenditures over the past three years largely relates to the ongoing renewal and replacement of equipment in the 35 construction equipment operations and investments in computer infrastructure upgrades. Capital expenditures in future years are expected to include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, purchase and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in automated systems. The company holds excess cash in bank deposits and marketable securities. These investments are governed by the companys investment policy, which focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield. These investments are placed with highly rated banks and include short term fixed income securities, money market funds which invest in U.S. Government related securities, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. Government related securities, medium term fixed income securities and highly rated commercial paper. During 2006, the company amended and restated its Senior Credit Facility, increasing the size from $800 million to $1.5 billion and extending the maturity to 2011. In February 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due February 15, 2024 and received proceeds of $323 million, net of underwriting discounts. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of engineering and corporate office facilities in California through payoff of the lease financing. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash. Notes are convertible during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of the companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 percent of the conversion price in effect on that 30th trading day (the "trigger price"). The split adjusted trigger price is currently $36.20, but is subject to adjustment as outlined in the indenture. The trigger price condition has been satisfied during each period since the fourth quarter of 2005 and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. During 2008, holders converted $174 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 4,058,792 shares of the companys common stock. During 2007, holders converted $23 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 503,462 shares of the companys common stock. The company does not know the timing or principal amount of the remaining Notes that may be presented for conversion in future periods. Holders of Notes were entitled to require the company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes on February 17, 2009 at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest; a de minimis amount of Notes was tendered for purchase. Holders of Notes will again be entitled to have the company purchase their Notes at the same price on February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019. After February 16, 2009, the Notes are redeemable at the option of the company, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change of control of the company, each holder may require the company to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The outstanding principal amount of the Notes was $134 million and $307 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Available cash balances will be used to satisfy any principal and interest payments. Shares of the companys common stock will be issued to satisfy any appreciation between the conversion price and the market price on the date of conversion. During 2007 and 2006, non recourse project financing provided $102 and $127 million of financing cash flow, respectively, related to the National Roads Telecommunications Services Project. These amounts relate to the activities of a joint venture that was previously consolidated in the companys financial statements. See below under Variable Interest Entities National Roads Telecommunications Services Project for further discussion of this matter. On December 15, 2008, the company registered shares of its common and preferred stock, debt securities and warrants pursuant to its filing of a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 36 A warrant for the purchase of 920,000 shares was exercised in 2006, yielding proceeds of $17 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash flow of approximately $13 million during each of 2008 and 2007 and $15 million during 2006. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in open market or negotiated transactions. During 2008 and 2007, 6,000 shares and 5,600 shares, respectively, of company stock were repurchased by the company under its stock repurchase program. No purchases were made during 2006. The maximum number of shares that could still be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 8.3 million shares. In the first quarter of 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividends payable to $0.125 per share (split adjusted). Previously, in the first quarter of 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividends to $0.10 per share (split adjusted) from $0.08 per share (split adjusted). Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. However, for the dividend paid to shareholders as of January 3, 2006, payment by the company to the disbursing agent occurred in the month of December 2005, resulting in two cash payments by the company in the fourth quarter of 2005 and none in the first quarter of 2006. The payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. During 2008, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation losses that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss. During 2007 and 2006, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses of $85 million in 2008, and unrealized gains of $54 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006 relate to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash. The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore, the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. Liquidity is provided by cash generated from operations, advance billings on new awards and contracts in progress and access to financial markets. As the cash advances are reduced through use in project execution and, if not replaced by advances on new projects, the companys cash position may decline. While the impact of continued market volatility cannot be predicted, the company believes that for the next 12 months, cash generated from operations and advance billings, along with its unused credit capacity and the option to issue debt or equity securities, if required, is expected to be sufficient to fund operating requirements. The companys conservative financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings resulting in continued access to the tighter financial markets. The companys total debt to total capitalization ("debt to capital") ratio at December 31, 2008 was 5.4 percent compared to 12.5 percent at December 31, 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company maintains a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in its engineering and construction contracts. The company has $2.4 billion in committed and uncommitted lines of credit to support letters of credit. Letters of credit are provided to clients in the ordinary course of business in lieu of retention or performance and completion guarantees on engineering and construction contracts. At December 31, 2008, the company had $1.0 billion in letters of credit outstanding. The company has $149 million in credit lines for general purposes in addition to the amount above. The companys access to the commercial paper market has been limited as a result of the current financial crisis. However, the companys short term financing needs are not expected to be impacted due to its high cash balances and access to short term borrowing sources. The company also posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms, primarily to guarantee its performance on state and local government projects. 37 Contractual Obligations at December 31, 2008 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years (in millions) Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 134 $ 134 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Interest on debt obligations(1) 12 3 2 2 5 Operating leases(2) 328 57 111 59 101 Uncertain tax contingencies(3) 71 71 Joint venture contributions 25 2 10 13 Pension minimum funding(4) 169 16 34 119 Other post employment benefits 43 7 12 11 13 Other compensation related obligations(5) 247 26 57 65 99 Total $ 1,047 $ 245 $ 226 $ 269 $ 307 (1)Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payment indicated in the above table. Interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted. (2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3)Uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the "Over 5 years" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. (4)The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (5)Principally deferred executive compensation. Guarantees, Inflation and Insurance Arrangements Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurances to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. The amount of guarantees outstanding measured on this basis totaled $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2008. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs 38 exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. The carrying value of the liability for guarantees was not material as of December 31, 2008 or 2007. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. As of December 31, 2008, there were no material guarantees outstanding. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix the companys cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Insurance Arrangements The company utilizes a number of providers to meet its insurance and surety needs. The current financial crisis has not disrupted the companys insurance or surety programs or limited its ability to access needed insurance or surety capacity. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the company forms partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. Applying the guidance of FIN 46(R), the company evaluates qualitative and quantitative information for each partnership or joint venture at inception to determine, first, whether the entity formed is a variable interest entity ("VIE") and, second, if the company is the primary beneficiary and needs to consolidate the entity. Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in FIN 46(R), the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the entity is a VIE and whether consolidation is still required. A partnership or joint venture is considered a VIE if either (a) the total equity investment is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) characteristics of a controlling financial interest are missing (either the ability to make decisions through voting or other rights, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity), or (c) the voting rights of the equity holders are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity and or their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, and substantially all of the entitys activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidates the entity if the company will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both. The company considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining if it is the primary beneficiary. The majority of the partnerships and joint ventures that are formed for the execution of the companys projects are VIEs because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. However, often the VIE does not meet the consolidation requirements of FIN 46(R). The contractual agreements that define the ownership structure and equity investment at risk, distribution of profits and losses, risks, responsibilities, indebtedness, voting rights and board representation of the respective parties are used to determine if the entity is a VIE and if the company is the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the entity. 39  The partnerships or joint ventures of the company are typically characterized by a 50 percent or less, non controlling, ownership or participation interest, with decision making and distribution of expected gains and losses typically being proportionate to the ownership or participation interest. As such and as noted above, even when the partnership or joint venture is determined to be a VIE, the company is frequently not the primary beneficiary. Should losses occur in the execution of the project for which the VIE was established, the losses would be absorbed by the partners of the VIE. The majority of the partnership and joint venture agreements provide for capital calls to fund operations, as necessary; however, such funding is rare and is not currently anticipated. Some of the companys VIEs have debt, but the debt is typically non recourse in nature. At times, the companys participation in VIEs requires agreements to provide financial or performance assurances to clients. See " Guarantees, Inflation and Insurance Arrangements" above for a further discussion of such agreements. As of December 31, 2008 the company had a number of entities that were determined to be VIEs, with the majority not meeting the consolidation requirements of FIN 46(R). Most of the unconsolidated VIEs are proportionately consolidated, though the equity and cost methods of accounting for the investments are also used, depending on the companys respective participation rights, amount of influence in the VIE and other factors. The aggregate investment carrying value of the unconsolidated VIEs was $111 million at December 31, 2008 and was classified under Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investments in unconsolidated VIEs is typically limited to the aggregate of the carrying value of the investment and future funding commitments. Future funding commitments at December 31, 2008 for the unconsolidated VIEs were $24 million. In some cases, the company is required to consolidate VIEs. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities for consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2008 was $281 million and $202 million, respectively. None of the VIEs are individually material to the companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Below is a discussion of a couple of the companys more unique VIEs and related accounting considerations. National Roads Telecommunications Services ("NRTS") Project In 2005, the companys Industrial & Infrastructure segment was awarded a $544 million project by a joint venture, GeneSYS Telecommunications Limited ("GeneSYS"), in which the company owns a 45 percent interest and HSBC Infrastructure Fund Management Limited owns a 55 percent interest. The project was entered into with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport (the "Highways Agency") to design, build, maintain and finance a significant upgrade to the integrated transmission network throughout Englands motorways. GeneSYS financed the engineering and construction ("E&C") of the upgraded telecommunications infrastructure with approximately $279 million of non recourse debt (the "term loan facility") from a consortium of lenders (the "Banks") along with joint venture member equity contributions and subordinated debt which were financed during the construction period utilizing equity bridge loans from outside lenders. During September 2007, the joint venture members paid their required permanent financing commitments in the amount of $44 million and were issued Subordinated Notes by GeneSYS. These funds were used by GeneSYS to repay the temporary construction term financing including the companys equity bridge loan. In early October 2007, the newly constructed network achieved operational status and was fully accepted by the Highways Agency on December 20, 2007, thereby concluding the E&C phase and entering the operations and maintenance phase of the project. Based on a qualitative analysis of the variable interests of all parties involved at the formation of GeneSYS, under the provisions of FIN 46(R), the company was initially determined to be the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. The companys consolidated financial statements included the accounts of GeneSYS, and, accordingly, the non recourse debt provided by the Banks at the inception of the venture. Effective October 1, 2007, the company no longer consolidates the accounts of GeneSYS because it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. 40 FIN 46(R) requires that the initial determination of whether an entity is a VIE shall be reconsidered under certain conditions. One of those conditions is when the entitys governing documents or contractual arrangements are changed in a manner that changes the characteristics or adequacy of the entitys equity investment at risk. Such an event occurred in September 2007 upon the infusion of capital by the joint venture members which resulted in permanent financing through issuance of Subordinated Debentures by GeneSYS that replaced the temporary equity bridge loans that had been provided by outside lenders. This refinancing of temporary debt with permanent debt constituted a change in the governing documents of GeneSYS that required reconsideration of GeneSYS as a VIE. Based on the new capitalization structure of GeneSYS, the adequacy of the equity at risk in GeneSYS was evaluated and found to be inadequate to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support. Accordingly, upon reconsideration, GeneSYS continues to be a VIE. Because the company holds a variable interest in the entity through its equity and debt investments, a qualitative evaluation was undertaken to determine if it was the primary beneficiary. In this evaluation, the company considered all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests based on the contractual arrangements existing at the time of reconsideration. Based on this evaluation, the company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of GeneSYS. Accordingly, GeneSYS was not consolidated in the companys accounts at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, and is being accounted for on the equity method of accounting. Based on contractual documents, the companys maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in GeneSYS is its aggregate $20 million equity and debt investment plus any un remitted earnings. The term loan is an obligation of GeneSYS and will never be a debt repayment obligation of the company because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. Interstate 495 Capital Beltway Project In December 2007, the company was awarded the $1.3 billion Interstate 495 Capital Beltway high occupancy toll ("HOT") lanes project in Virginia. The project is a public private partnership between the Virginia Department of Transportation ("VDOT") and Capital Beltway Express LLC, a joint venture in which the company has a ten percent interest and Transurban (USA) Inc. has a 90 percent interest ("Fluor Transurban"). Under the agreement, VDOT owns and oversees the addition of traffic lanes, interchange improvements and construction of HOT lanes on 14 miles of the I 495 Capital Beltway in northern Virginia. Fluor Transurban, as concessionaire, will develop, design, finance, construct, maintain and operate the improvements and HOT lanes under an 80 year concession agreement. The construction is being financed through grant funding from VDOT, non recourse borrowings from issuance of public tax exempt bonds, a non recourse loan from the Federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act (TIFIA) which is administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation and equity contributions from the joint venture members. The construction of the improvements and HOT lanes are being performed by a construction joint venture in which the company has a 65 percent interest and Lane Construction has a 35 percent interest ("Fluor Lane"). Transurban (USA) Inc. will perform the operations and maintenance upon completion of the improvements and commencement of operations of the toll lanes. The company has evaluated its interest in Fluor Lane and has determined, based on a qualitative analysis, that the entity is a VIE. The company has further determined from an analysis of risk and contractual agreements that it is the primary beneficiary of Fluor Lane since the company absorbs the majority of Fluor Lanes expected returns or losses. Accordingly, the company consolidates Fluor Lane. As of December 31, 2008, the companys financial statements include assets of $55 million and liabilities of $48 million for Fluor Lane. Fluor Transurban has been determined to be a VIE under the provisions of FIN 46(R). Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46(R), the company evaluated its interest in Fluor Transurban including its project execution obligations and risks relating to its interest in Fluor Lane and has determined based on a qualitative analysis that it is not the primary beneficiary of Fluor Transurban. Based on contractual 41 documents, the companys maximum exposure to loss relating to its investment in Fluor Transurban is its $35 million aggregate equity investment commitment, of which $11 million has been funded, plus any un remitted earnings. The company will never have repayment obligations associated with any of the debt because it is non recourse to the joint venture members. The company accounts for its ownership interest in Fluor Transurban on the equity method of accounting.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The company invests excess cash in short term securities, primarily time deposits, that carry a floating money market rate of return. Additionally, a substantial portion of the companys cash balances are maintained in foreign countries. All of the companys long term debt instruments carry a fixed rate coupon. The companys exposure to interest rate risk on fixed rate debt is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations. The company utilizes derivative instruments to hedge exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices to minimize the volatility of project cost. The company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. At December 31, 2008, the company had foreign exchange forward contracts of less than 2 years duration to exchange major world currencies for U.S. dollars. The total gross notional amount of these contracts was $112 million. At December 31, 2008 the company had commodity swap forward contracts of less than 5 years duration and a total gross notional amount of $54 million. The company does not currently use derivatives, such as swaps, to alter the interest characteristics of its short term securities or its debt instruments. During 2008, exchange rates for functional currencies for most of the companys international operations weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation losses that are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss.
