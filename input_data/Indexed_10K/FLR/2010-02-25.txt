Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, "segment profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate administrative and general expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Consolidated revenue of $22.0 billion in 2009 was essentially level with 2008 consolidated revenue of $22.3 billion. The revenue for the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments increased in 2009 when compared to the prior year, while 2009 revenue decreases occurred in the other three segments. Consolidated revenue in 2008 increased to $22.3 billion compared to $16.7 billion in 2007. While all business segments contributed to the increase in revenue in 2008, the Oil & Gas segment was the primary driver, growing by 55 percent when compared to the prior year. Over the past several years, the company has experienced significant revenue growth, particularly in the Oil & Gas segment, due to higher levels of capital spending by many clients to support an increase in global demand for oil and gas. However, the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in some project delays and cancellations in 2009 as some clients reassessed their capital spending plans. In addition, the capacity expansion in the North American refining market is nearing an end, further impacting the segments ability to maintain its recent level of performance. Though the prospect of growth for the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments remains promising, the weak economy continues to affect the Global Services segment, with uncertainty over the timing of a broad based recovery. The Power segment continues to be impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants and the lingering effects of the global credit crisis and recession. Earnings before taxes were $1.1 billion in both 2009 and 2008. The 2009 segment profit of the Oil & Gas segment increased slightly from 2008, while the 2009 performance of both the Government and Power segments improved significantly. The 2009 segment profit of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment declined when compared to the prior year, primarily because 2008 included a pre tax gain from the sale of the companys joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm Project ("Greater Gabbard Project") in the United Kingdom, partially offset by provisions for a fixed price telecommunications project in the United Kingdom, both discussed under " Industrial & Infrastructure" below. The 2009 performance of the Global Services segment was negatively impacted by a provision for the non collectability of a client receivable and the continued effects of the recession, discussed further under " Global Services" below. The company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in 2009 when compared to 2008, primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation related costs, though much of this improvement was offset by a significant decrease in net interest income in 2009 due to the impact of lower interest rates. Earnings before taxes for 2008 increased 73 percent compared to earnings before taxes of $660 million in 2007, primarily as a result of a 61 percent improvement in the companys segment profit. All business segments experienced improvements in profitability due to increases in the level of project execution activities in 2008. As noted above, the 2008 segment profit of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment included a pre tax gain from the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project in the United Kingdom, partially offset by provisions for a fixed price telecommunications project in the United Kingdom. The 2008 segment profit of the Government segment also improved compared to the prior year due to the absence of charges associated with the 27 Table of Contents Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan which negatively impacted the operating performance of the segment in 2007, as discussed under " Government" below. The 2008 segment profit of the Power segment included a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable, discussed under " Power" below. The improved operating performance of the business segments in 2008 was offset somewhat by higher corporate general and administrative expense, including higher compensation related costs and a loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the United Kingdom. Earnings before taxes in 2008 were also higher when compared to 2007 due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the reduction of outstanding debt resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in 2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 was 35.5 percent, slightly higher than the effective tax rate of 34.4 percent for 2008. The effective tax rate for 2008 included favorable benefits resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances, statute expirations and tax settlements. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 17.2 percent and included the impact of the final resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of a tax audit relating to tax years 1996 through 2000. Factors affecting the effective tax rates for 2007 2009 are discussed further under " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation were $3.75 per share in 2009, a four percent decrease compared to $3.89 per share in 2008. Earnings per share in 2008 represented a 35 percent improvement compared to earnings per share of $2.88 in 2007. Both the 2009 and 2008 per share amounts included the impact of positive contributions associated with a higher overall level of project execution activities when compared to 2007. Earnings per share in 2009 also included the negative impact of a provision for the non collectability of an accounts receivable in the Global Services segment ($0.15 per share). Earnings per share in 2008 reflected the positive effect of the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project ($0.27 per share) and the negative impact of provisions for the fixed price telecommunications project ($0.11 per share), both in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and discussed above. Earnings per share in 2007 included the impact of the $123 million ($0.68 per share) settlement with the IRS noted previously. Consolidated new awards for 2009 were $18.5 billion, compared to $25.1 billion in 2008, and $22.6 billion in 2007. The decrease in new award activity in 2009 was attributable to the Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments, offset somewhat by increased new awards in Industrial & Infrastructure and Government. The increase in new award activity in 2008 was primarily attributable to the Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure segments, partially offset by lower new awards for Power. Approximately 73 percent of consolidated new awards for 2009 were for projects located outside of the United States. Consolidated backlog was $26.8 billion as of December 31, 2009, $33.2 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $30.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. The decrease in backlog during 2009 was primarily due to certain project cancellations and scope reductions, as well as work performed on existing projects outpacing new award activity. The Oil & Gas segment experienced a sharp decline in backlog, offset somewhat by an increase in Industrial & Infrastructure backlog. As noted above, the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in cancellations and scope reductions of certain projects in Oil & Gas during 2009, and the capacity expansion in the North American refining market is winding down, further reducing the segments backlog. The growth in Industrial & Infrastructure backlog was driven by new award activity in the mining and metals business line. Consolidated backlog grew during 2008 primarily due to strong demand for capital investment in Oil & Gas markets and large awards in Industrial & Infrastructure. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 62 percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the United States. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate administrative and general expense and other items, see " Segment Operations" and " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. 28 Table of Contents Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies. Engineering and Construction Contracts Engineering and construction contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Contracts are segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, and accordingly, gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered. The percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. Pre contract costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. As of December 31, 2009, 79 percent of the companys backlog is cost reimbursable while 21 percent is for guaranteed maximum, lump sum or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages. In addition, increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. The company believes that there may be an increase in the percentage of lump sum projects executed by the company because of the highly competitive market conditions and global recession. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions. The company recognizes, under ASC 605 35 25, certain significant claims for recovery of incurred cost when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims amounted to $247 million and $202 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable, but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties. The company generally accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportionate consolidation basis unless the joint venture is fully consolidated under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46(R)" (ASC 810). Under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting, the company consolidates its 29 Table of Contents proportionate share of venture revenue, cost and segment profit in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The companys accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established. The company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution. Generally, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment. Execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements. When the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution, the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenue using appropriate contract accounting principles. ASC 810 provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary. In general, a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. ASC 810 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. The company evaluates the applicability of ASC 810 to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards, and will reevaluate applicability upon the occurrence of certain events. Contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionately consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 00 1, "Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures" (ASC 910 810 45) and Statement of Position 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts" (ASC 605 35). Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. Interim testing of goodwill is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. During 2009, the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired. Deferred Taxes and Tax Contingencies Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. As of December 31, 2009, the company had deferred tax assets of $483 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $43 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $61 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The allowance for 2009 primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in 30 Table of Contents the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended by SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" (ASC 715 30). As required by ASC 715 30, the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the companys financial statements. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $50 million and $90 million for the calendar year 2010, which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required. If the discount rate were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities would increase by approximately $33 million. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management. The company is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. For more information on the business segments see Item 1 "Business" above. Oil & Gas Revenue and segment profit for the Oil & Gas segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 11,826.9 $ 12,946.3 $ 8,369.9 Segment profit 729.7 723.8 432.7 Revenue in 2009 decreased nearly 9 percent when compared to 2008 due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects within the segment near completion. Both revenue and segment profit increased substantially in both 2009 and 2008 when compared to 2007 as a result of growth in project execution activities due to the significant levels of new project awards during 2006 through 2008. Segment profit margin was 6.2 percent in 2009 compared to 5.6 percent in 2008 and 5.2 percent in 2007. Segment profit margin in 2009 was comparatively higher than in 2008 primarily due to the net positive impact of adjustments for certain projects nearing completion, which were primarily due to the approval of change orders and the successful resolution of disputed items. Segment profit margin in 2008 was comparatively higher than in 2007 for a number of reasons, including the relatively high percentage of work in the engineering phase, which will typically generate higher margins than the construction phase, and improved contributions from other projects of the segment. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $7.0 billion in 2009, $15.1 billion in 2008 and $13.5 billion in 2007. New awards in 2009 included a major Canadian oil sands project valued at $1.8 billion and an expansion to an onshore production facility in Russia valued at $842 million. New awards in 2008 included two refinery expansion projects in the United States valued at $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion, and a $1.0 billion polysilicon project in China. New awards in 2007 included refinery expansion projects in Spain and the United States. amounting to $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $11.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 compared to $21.4 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $18.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. The segment has been a participant in an expanding market that included very large project awards in diverse geographical locations, which were well suited to the companys global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. However, the global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in some clients reassessing their capital spending plans for 2009 and beyond, with others delaying or even canceling projects. In addition, the large projects awarded as part of the capacity expansion of the North American refining market are nearing completion, and no other major refining projects in this region are anticipated in the near term. The lower 2009 new awards and ending backlog are reflective of these changing market conditions and correspond with a decline in demand for new capacity in oil and gas production and refining, as well as polysilicon. Ending backlog in 2009 was also impacted by $5.2 billion of project cancellations and scope reductions. The high growth and level of profitability recently experienced by the segment are not expected to be maintained in 2010. Total assets in the segment were $972 million as of December 31, 2009, $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $891 million as of December 31, 2007. The change in total assets from year to year has been primarily due to the changing level of project execution activities over the periods. Industrial & Infrastructure Revenue and segment profit for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 4,820.6 $ 3,470.3 $ 3,385.0 Segment profit 140.4 208.2 101.0 Revenue in 2009 increased 39 percent from 2008 due to significant growth in the mining and metals and infrastructure business lines. Revenue in 2008 improved slightly from 2007 on the strength of project execution activities on mining and metals and manufacturing and life sciences projects. Segment profit and segment profit margin for 2009 declined compared to 2008 primarily because the prior year included a pre tax gain of $79.2 million from the sale of the companys joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project, offset somewhat by the impact of 2008 provisions totaling $32.7 million related to the London Connect Project. Segment profit margin in 2009 was also negatively impacted as the result of a significant shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering and feasibility studies to lower margin construction activities in the manufacturing and life sciences and mining and metals business lines, the continuation of the downturn in the life sciences market and reduced margins on Greater Gabbard Project execution activities in the infrastructure business line. In addition, the segment experienced lower margins in 2009 as the result of the consolidation of a large mining project joint venture in which the segment reports all of the joint ventures revenue, but only the segments share of the joint ventures profit. Segment profit and segment profit margin for 2008 improved significantly compared to 2007, primarily as the result of improved performance in mining and metals and the aforementioned pre tax gain of the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project, offset somewhat by the impact of provisions related to the London Connect Project, also noted above. The higher margins for the mining and metals business line in 2008 were largely attributable to an increase in the mix of engineering and consulting projects, which typically generate higher margins than projects in the construction phase. The segments ability to command more favorable pricing due to its capabilities and project execution performance, along with industry wide resource constraints, also contributed to the higher mining margins in 2008. The 2007 period was also negatively impacted by provisions totaling $25 million related to a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. 32 Table of Contents The company was involved in dispute resolution proceedings in connection with the London Connect Project, a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows transmission and reception throughout the London Underground system. The project, which is now complete, was subject to significant delays, resulting in additional costs to the company and claims against the client. As mentioned previously, during 2008, provisions of $32.7 million were recognized as the result of reassessments of the remaining time and cost to complete the project and the probability of recovery of liquidated damages and certain claims. In 2009, the company settled the dispute with no material change to segment profit. As a result of the settlement, the company is no longer reporting claim revenue for the project, which totaled $105 million and $116 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The company participated in a 50/50 joint venture for a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. This joint venture project was adversely impacted by higher costs due to owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays. As noted above, during 2007, provisions of $25 million were recognized by the company due to increases in estimated cost. As of December 31, 2009, the company has recognized in cost and revenue its $52 million proportionate share of $104 million of cost relating to claims recognized by the joint venture. Total claims related costs incurred, as well as claims submitted to the client by the joint venture, are in excess of the $104 million of recognized cost. As of December 31, 2009, the client had withheld liquidated damages totaling $51 million from amounts otherwise due the joint venture and had asserted additional claims against the joint venture. The company believes that the claims against the joint venture are without merit and that amounts withheld will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and has, therefore, not recognized any reduction in project revenue for its $25.5 million proportionate share of the withheld liquidated damages. In addition, the client has drawn down $14.8 million against letters of credit provided by the company and its joint venture partner. The company believes that the amounts drawn down against the letters of credit will ultimately be recovered by the joint venture and, as such, has not reserved for the possible non recovery of the companys $7.4 million proportionate share. The project opened to traffic in November 2007 and reached construction completion in the second quarter of 2009. The company continues to evaluate claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project and continues to incur legal expenses associated with the claims and dispute resolution process. The company is involved in a dispute in connection with the Greater Gabbard Project, a $1.7 billion lump sum project to provide engineering, procurement and construction services for the clients offshore wind farm project in the United Kingdom. The dispute relates to specifications for monopiles and transition pieces required under the contract. By the end of 2009, the company had recorded $162 million of claim revenue related to this issue for costs incurred to date. Substantial additional costs arising from this dispute are expected to be incurred in future quarters. The company believes the ultimate recovery of incurred and future costs is probable. The company does not expect to recognize any profit related to this project until the dispute is resolved. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $6.8 billion during 2009, $5.0 billion during 2008 and $3.4 billion during 2007. New awards during 2009 were driven by the mining and metals business line, including a $2.9 billion project in Australia and a $2.2 billion project in Canada. New awards during 2008 reflected substantial activity in mining and metals and also included the infrastructure business lines Greater Gabbard Project in the United Kingdom. New awards during 2007 were also concentrated in the mining sector and included a $1.3 billion transportation infrastructure project in Virginia. Ending backlog for the segment increased to $10.2 billion for 2009 from $6.7 billion for 2008 and $6.1 billion for 2007. The growth in backlog during 2009 is reflective of the significant new award activity for the year and project adjustments of $1.5 billion. The project adjustments were primarily due to the positive impact on backlog of a weakening U.S. dollar for projects awarded in other currencies and revisions to project cost, mainly for customer furnished materials and the Greater Gabbard Project. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $676 million as of December 31, 2009 compared to $536 million as of December 31, 2008 and $576 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in total assets in 2009 was primarily due to contract work in progress associated with recording claim revenue for the Greater Gabbard Project. 33  Table of Contents Government Revenue and segment profit for the Government segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 1,983.2 $ 1,319.9 $ 1,308.2 Segment profit 116.8 52.2 29.3 Revenue for the Government segment in 2009 increased by 50 percent compared to 2008, primarily as the result of project execution activities for Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ("LOGCAP IV") task orders for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, the Savannah River Site Management and Operating ("Savannah River") Project in South Carolina and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA") funded work at Savannah River. The higher revenue in the 2009 periods was offset somewhat by reduced volume at the Hanford Environmental Management Program ("Hanford") Project in Washington. Revenue in 2008 increased slightly compared to revenue in 2007, primarily due to the start up of the Savannah River Project which offsets reduced contributions from the embassy projects and Iraq related work. Other contributors to 2008 revenue included support for the Public Assistance Program for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Hanford Project and work that began in late 2008 in support of LOGCAP IV task orders. Segment profit for the Government segment during 2009 more than doubled when compared to the performance in the prior year as the result of contributions from LOGCAP IV task orders, the Savannah River Project, project execution activities associated with ARRA funding at Savannah River and a favorable outcome of $15.3 million related to requests for equitable adjustment on a fixed price contract at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. The higher segment profit in 2009 was offset somewhat by reduced contributions for the Hanford Project and Iraq related work. Segment profit in 2008 increased significantly compared to 2007, primarily because 2007 segment profit was negatively impacted by provisions totaling $21 million for the Bagram Air Base contract. As mentioned above, provisions totaling $21 million were recognized for the Bagram Air Base contract in 2007. Provisions totaling $29 million had also been recorded for the project in 2006. These charges related to subcontractor execution issues and liquidated damages due to the resulting delay in project completion. During 2008, the Bagram project was completed and various disputed items and warranty issues were resolved, resulting in the recognition of $5 million of segment profit during the year. The remaining disputed items and warranty obligations were resolved in 2009 and, as indicated previously, $15.3 million was recognized in segment profit during 2009. The company performed work on 11 embassy projects over the last six years for the U.S. Department of State under fixed priced contracts. These projects were adversely impacted by higher costs due to schedule extensions, scope changes causing material deviations from the Standard Embassy Design, increased costs to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. The last of the embassy projects was completed in 2008, with some warranty items for certain projects still ongoing. As of December 31, 2009, aggregate costs totaling $33 million relating to claims on two of the embassy projects had been recognized in revenue. Total claims related costs incurred to date, along with claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified, exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue. As the first formal step in dispute resolution, all claims have been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements. The company continues to periodically evaluate its position with respect to these claims. New awards in the Government segment were $2.3 billion during 2009, compared to $1.4 billion during 2008 and $1.2 billion during 2007. Significant new awards for 2009 include the annual funding for the Savannah River Project, the multi year ARRA funding at Savannah River and LOGCAP IV task orders. The increase in new awards in 2008 was driven by the start up of the Savannah River 34 Table of Contents Project and the first task orders issued to the company under LOGCAP IV. The Savannah River Projects transitional work and first full year of operations were included as a new award in 2008. The company reports new awards for LOGCAP IV as individual task orders are awarded and funded. Backlog for the segment was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, $804 million as of December 31, 2008 and $740 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in backlog in 2009 over the prior year is primarily due to multi year funding at Savannah River related to ARRA work. Total assets in the Government segment were $660 million as of December 31, 2009, $326 million as of December 31, 2008 and $285 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in total assets in 2009 corresponded to an increase in working capital to support project execution activities, particularly for LOGCAP IV task orders. Global Services Revenue and segment profit for the Global Services segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 2,069.0 $ 2,675.8 $ 2,460.0 Segment profit 140.1 229.3 201.4 Revenue for the Global Services segment decreased during 2009 compared to the prior year primarily due to declining volumes of capital work and fewer refinery turnarounds and shutdowns. The segment began to be impacted by the global recession during the fourth quarter of 2008, particularly for natural resource prospects. The drop in commodity prices and the overall economic environment have caused delays of work originally planned for late 2008 and 2009. In certain cases, refinery turnaround and shutdown work previously awarded to the operations and maintenance business line has been performed internally by the clients themselves. All of the business lines of the segment continue to be affected by the weak economy and it remains unclear as to when a broad based recovery will occur. The 2008 increase in revenue when compared to 2007 reflected growth across most of the segments various business lines. The operations and maintenance business line experienced growth in the majority of its markets during 2008, but its results were unfavorably impacted by delays in refinery turnarounds and hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Segment profit margin in the Global Services segment was 6.8 percent, 8.6 percent and 8.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Segment profit and segment profit margin were negatively impacted during 2009 due to a $45 million provision for the non collectability of a client receivable for a paper mill in the operations and maintenance business line where the companys scope of work was to recommission, start up and operate the facility. Segment profit in 2009 also declined compared to 2008 due to the impact of the economic and market conditions mentioned previously on the operations and maintenance, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines. Segment profit and segment profit margin increased in 2008 from 2007 due to the strong business environment that extended across most of Global Services markets at that time. Operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise Global Services backlog. Short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog. In addition, the equipment, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards. New awards in the Global Services segment were $1.3 billion during 2009, $2.1 billion during 2008 and $2.2 billion during 2007. The decline in new awards in 2009 compared to 2008 is indicative of the economic and market conditions discussed above. New awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients. Backlog for the Global Services segment was $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2009, $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. 35 Table of Contents Although new awards and backlog declined in 2009, the segment retained a high percentage of its existing clients and jobsites, while also increasing the number of new clients. Total assets in the Global Services segment were $841 million as of December 31, 2009 compared to $763 million as of December 31, 2008 and $856 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in the segments total assets in 2009 was due to an increase in working capital to support project start ups in the operations and maintenance business line, additional working capital to support ongoing equipment transactions and an expansion of the equipment fleet to support long term agreements. The decrease in total assets in 2008 was due to the reduction in working capital in the equipment, supply chain solutions and operations and maintenance business lines. Power Revenue and segment profit for the Power segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Revenue $ 1,290.6 $ 1,913.6 $ 1,167.9 Segment profit 124.2 75.4 38.0 Power segment revenue in 2009 declined 33 percent from 2008, primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on the Oak Grove coal fired power project in Texas for Luminant, a unit of Energy Futures Holdings Corporation, that is progressing closer to completion. Revenue in 2008 increased substantially compared to 2007 as the result of higher level of project execution activities for projects awarded in 2006 and early 2007, including the Oak Grove project. Segment profit in 2009 increased compared to 2008 primarily due to increased activity on several gas turbine projects, increased pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in Texas and project completion adjustments for two emissions control programs. In addition, segment profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable of $9 million for the Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant ("Rabigh") in Saudi Arabia. Even with the Rabigh provision, segment profit increased in 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily as a result of higher levels of project execution activities, including the Oak Grove project. Segment profit margin of 9.6 percent in 2009 is considerably higher than the segment profit margin of 3.9 percent in 2008 primarily due to increased pre construction activities on the nuclear new build project in Texas, project completion adjustments in 2009 for certain projects that are progressing closer to completion and the negative impact in 2008 for the Rabigh project provision mentioned above. Segment profit margin in 2008 was higher than the 3.3 percent segment profit margin in 2007 as a result of higher levels of project execution activities, including the Oak Grove project, and higher front end services in the nuclear business line, offset somewhat by the Rabigh provision. The Power segment continues to be impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants due to concerns over carbon emissions. In addition, power producers have been impacted by the global credit crisis and ensuing recession which reduced demand. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount, but occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $894 million in 2009 included the Dominion Bear Garden gas fired plant in Virginia and nuclear preconstruction services. New awards of $1.3 billion in 2008 include a gas fired power plant in Texas, expansions to an existing emissions control retrofit program in Kentucky and an emissions control retrofit program in Texas for Luminant. New awards of $2.2 billion in 2007 included $1.7 billion for the Oak Grove award. Backlog for the Power segment was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2009, $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2007. The decline in backlog since 2007 is largely due to project execution activities associated with the Oak Grove project. 36 Table of Contents Total assets in the Power segment decreased to $75 million as of December 31, 2009 from $131 million as of December 31, 2008 and $151 million as of December 31, 2007 due to a reduction in working capital for project execution activities, including the Oak Grove project that is nearing completion. Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, corporate administrative and general expenses were $179 million, $230 million and $194 million, respectively. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation costs, offset somewhat by foreign currency losses and other factors. The increase in corporate administrative and general expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher compensation related costs and a $16 million loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the United Kingdom. These increases in 2008 corporate administrative and general expenses were offset somewhat by foreign currency gains. Corporate administrative and general expense included $2 million of non operating expense in 2009 compared to $18 million of non operating expense in 2008, of which $16 million is for the loss on the sale of the building and associated legal entity discussed above, and $3 million of non operating income during 2007. Net interest income was $14 million, $48 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 decline was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, offset partially by the cumulative increase in the balance of cash and marketable securities, with some of the latter being noncurrent. Net interest income increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest expense that resulted from the deconsolidation of non recourse project finance debt in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the reduction of outstanding debt resulting from the conversion of convertible notes in 2008. Tax The effective tax rates on the companys pretax earnings were 35.5 percent, 34.4 percent and 17.2 percent for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by increased earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for which taxes are not paid by the company because the consolidated entities are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. However, the 2009 effective tax rate was slightly higher when compared to the prior year primarily because the effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by the reversal of certain valuation allowances of $19 million and statute expirations and tax settlements of $28 million. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 was due to the reduction of income tax expense of $123 million for the year as the result of an IRS Appeals settlement in connection with the IRS examination of the companys income tax returns for the period November 1, 1995 through December 31, 2000. The settlement lowered the effective tax rate for 2007 by 19 percentage points. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution Conex International v. Fluor Enterprises, Inc. In November 2006, a Jefferson County, Texas, jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of Conex International ("Conex") v. Fluor Enterprises Inc. ("FEI"), ruling in favor of Conex and awarded $99 million in damages related to a 2001 construction project. In 2001, Atofina (now part of Total Petrochemicals Inc.) hired Conex International to be the mechanical contractor on a project at Atofinas refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. FEI was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to Atofina on the project. There was no contract between Conex and FEI. Later in 2001 after the project was complete, Conex and Atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project. Conex sued FEI in September 2003 alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that FEI should pay Conex the balance of the extra work charges that Atofina did not pay in the settlement. Conex also asserted that FEI interfered with Conexs contract and business relationship with Atofina. The jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference. 37 Table of Contents The company appealed the decision and the judgment against the company was reversed in its entirety in December 2008. Both parties appealed the decision to the Texas Supreme Court, and the Court denied both petitions and remanded the matter back to the trial court for a new trial. Based upon the present status of this matter, the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred. Fluor Corporation v. Citadel Equity Fund Ltd. Citadel Equity Fund Ltd., a hedge fund and former investor in the companys 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes"), is disputing the calculation of the number of shares of the companys common stock that were due to Citadel upon conversion of approximately $58 million of Notes. Citadel has argued that it is entitled to an additional $28 million in value under its proposed calculation method. The company believes that the payout given to Citadel was proper and correct and that Citadels claims are without merit. In January 2010, the court agreed with the company by granting the companys motion for summary judgment in its entirety. In February 2010, the court entered judgment in favor of the company, and Citadel filed a notice of appeal. Based upon the present status of this matter, the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred. Other As of December 31, 2009, a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process. These include a fixed price transportation infrastructure project and the Greater Gabbard Offshore Project, which are discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure" and certain Embassy Projects, which are discussed above under " Government". Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and access to financial markets. In addition, the company has committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling $3.0 billion, which may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit and general purposes. The company believes that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, along with its unused credit capacity of $1.9 billion, is sufficient to fund operating requirements. The companys conservative financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings, resulting in continued access to the financial markets and the option to issue debt or equity securities, if required. As of December 31, 2009, the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants related to its debt agreements. The companys total debt to total capitalization ("debt to capital") ratio as of December 31, 2009 was 3.7 percent compared to 5.3 percent as of December 31, 2008. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2009, essentially level with the $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents in 2008 increased $0.7 billion compared to 2007. Cash and cash equivalents combined with current and noncurrent marketable securities were $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was $899 million compared to $975 million in 2008 and $922 million in 2007. Cash provided by operating activities during 2009 resulted primarily from earnings sources and decreased compared to 2008 primarily due to the dispute on the Greater Gabbard Project and higher cash payments related to income taxes, somewhat offset by lower contributions into the companys defined benefit pension plans. Cash provided by operating activities during 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from earning sources and increases in customer advance 38 Table of Contents billings. Cash generated by operating activities in 2007 also includes the billing and collection of fees on the Fernald project. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects, as well as the companys volume of work and ability to execute projects within budget. New awards generally result in start up activities where the use of cash is greatest on projects for which cash is not provided by advances from clients. As work progresses on these projects and client payments increase, the cash used in the start up activities is recovered and project cash flows tend to stabilize through project completion. Cash is also provided by operating activities through advance billings on contracts in progress. The companys cash position is reduced as customer advances are used in project execution, unless they are replaced by advances on new projects. The company maintains short term borrowing facilities to satisfy any net operating cash outflows, in the event there is an investment in operating assets that exceeds the projects available cash balances. The company used significant cash in 2009 to fund ongoing work related to the dispute on the Greater Gabbard Project as discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure." As of December 31, 2009, the company had incurred costs and recorded claim revenue of $162 million related to this dispute, of which $152 million was funded during the year. Income tax payments increased from $320 million in 2008 to $418 million in 2009 as a result of increased tax liabilities and the prepayment of some 2010 income taxes. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Contributions into the defined contribution plans of $99 million during 2009 were comparable to 2008 contributions of $98 million. The 2008 contributions into the defined contribution plans increased compared to the $74 million contributed in 2007 as a result of increases in the number of eligible employees. The company contributed $34 million, $190 million and $62 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The lower contributions in 2009 were due to the rebounding of the financial markets during the year. The $190 million of contributions in 2008 were a result of adverse financial market conditions coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to generally maintain full funding of accumulated benefits. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 all plans were funded to the level of accumulated benefits. Investing Activities Cash utilized by investing activities amounted to $818 million and $793 million in 2009 and 2007, respectively, while cash provided by investing activities amounted to $23 million in 2008. The primary investing activities during 2009, 2008 and 2007 included purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; capital expenditures; and disposals of property, plant and equipment. Investing activities in 2008 also included the sale of the joint venture interest the Greater Gabbard Project. The company holds excess cash in bank deposits and marketable securities which are governed by the companys investment policy. This policy focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield. These investments are placed with highly rated banks and include money market funds which invest in U.S. Government related securities, bank deposits, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. Government related securities, commercial paper and high quality short term and medium term fixed income securities. In 2009 and 2007, the companys purchases of marketable securities exceeded its proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities by $623 million and $539 million, respectively. The proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by $211 million in 2008. The company held current and noncurrent marketable securities of $939 million and $296 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 39  Table of Contents Cash utilized by investing activities in 2009, 2008 and 2007 included capital expenditures of $233 million, $300 million and $284 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during 2009, 2008 and 2007 included significant outflows related to the equipment business line of the Global Services segment, as well as investments in computer infrastructure upgrades and the refurbishment of facilities. Capital expenditures in future years are expected to include equipment purchases for the equipment operations of the Global Services segment, purchase and refurbishment of other facilities and computer infrastructure in support of the companys continuing investment in information technology. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2009 included $38 million primarily related to the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment operations in the Global Services segment compared to $48 million and $60 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2008 include proceeds of $79 million from the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project. Financing Activities Cash utilized in financing activities during 2009 and 2008 of $317 million and $253 million, respectively, and cash provided by financing activities during 2007 of $17 million included convertible note repayments, company dividend payments to shareholders and distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests. Cash utilized in financing activities during 2009 also included company stock repurchases. Cash provided by financing activities in 2007 also includes proceeds and some repayments related to non recourse project financing. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in open market or negotiated transactions. The company repurchased 3,060,000 shares, 6,000 shares and 5,600 shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program resulting in cash outflows of $125.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The maximum number of shares that could still be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 5.2 million shares. In the first quarter of 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividends payable to $0.125 per share (split adjusted). Dividends in the amount of $91 million, $90 million and $70 million were paid in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. The payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. Distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests represent cash outflows to partners of consolidated partnerships or joint ventures created primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. Distributions paid were $76 million, $24 million and $17 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The significant increase in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 is due to the Rapid Growth Project which is discussed at "Note 13. Variable Interest Entities". In February 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due February 15, 2024 and received proceeds of $323 million, net of underwriting discounts. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of engineering and corporate office facilities in California through payoff of the lease financing. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash. Notes are convertible during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of the companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 percent of the conversion price in effect on that 30th trading day (the "trigger price"). The trigger price is currently $36.20, but is subject to adjustment as outlined in the indenture. The trigger price condition was satisfied during the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008 and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt. During 2009, holders converted $24 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 253,309 shares of the companys common stock. During 2008, holders converted $174 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 4,058,792 40 Table of Contents shares of the companys common stock. During 2007, holders converted $23 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 503,462 shares of the companys common stock. The company does not know the timing or principal amount of the remaining Notes that may be presented for conversion in future periods. Holders of Notes will be entitled to require the company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount plus unpaid interest on February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019. The Notes are currently redeemable at the option of the company, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change of control of the company, each holder may require the company to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The carrying value amount of the Notes was $110 million and $133 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Available cash balances will be used to satisfy any principal and interest payments. Shares of the companys common stock will be issued to satisfy any appreciation between the conversion price and the market price on the date of conversion. During 2007, non recourse project financing proceeds were $102 million, of which $23 million was repaid related to the National Roads Telecommunications Services Project. These amounts relate to the activities of a joint venture that was previously consolidated in the companys financial statements. See "Note 13. Variable Interest Entities" for further discussion of this matter. On December 15, 2008, the company registered shares of its common and preferred stock, debt securities and warrants pursuant to its filing of a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash During 2009 and 2007, functional currency exchange rates for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains. During 2008, functional currency exchange rates for most of the companys international operations weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation losses. The unrealized translation gains and losses resulting from changes in functional currency exchange rates are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss. Unrealized gains of $89 million and $54 million in 2009 and 2007, respectively, and unrealized losses of $85 million in 2008 relate to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash. The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The company has a combination of committed and uncommitted lines of credit that total $3.0 billion. These lines may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit and general purposes. The committed lines of credit consist of a $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility that matures in 2011 and a $500 million letter of credit facility that was executed in the third quarter of 2009 and matures in 2014. Borrowings on the $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility are to bear interest at rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus an applicable borrowing margin. Letters of credit are provided to clients and other third parties in the ordinary course of business to meet bonding requirements. As of December 31, 2009, $1.1 billion in letters of credit were outstanding under these lines of credit. The company posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms of the contracts, primarily to guarantee its performance on state and local government projects. As of December 31, 2009, the performance of the financial markets has not disrupted the companys surety programs or limited its ability to access needed surety capacity. 41 Table of Contents Guarantees, Inflation and Variable Interest Entities Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated and consolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. Performance guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2009 are estimated to be $3.6 billion. The company assessed its performance guarantee obligation in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (ASC 460) and the carrying value of the liability was not material as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. Long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included a financial guarantee on behalf of an unrelated third party that totaled approximately $18 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix the companys cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the company forms partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. The ownership percentage of these partnerships or joint ventures is typically representative of the work to be performed or the amount of risk assumed by each partner. These partnerships and joint ventures are typically considered variable interest entities ("VIEs") under FIN 46(R) (ASC 810 10). The company has consolidated all VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. Most of the unconsolidated VIEs are proportionately consolidated, though the equity and cost methods of accounting for the investment are also used, depending on the companys respective participation rights, amount of influence in the VIE and other factors. Under the proportionate consolidation method, the company recognizes its proportionate share of joint venture revenue, cost and operating profit in its Consolidated Statement of Earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2009 was $425 million and $282 million, respectively. The aggregate investment carrying value of the 42 Table of Contents unconsolidated VIEs was $116 million as of December 31, 2009 and was classified under "Investments" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. None of the VIEs are individually material to the companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion of the companys VIEs, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2009 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years (in millions) Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 110 $ 110 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Interest on debt obligations(1) 11 3 2 2 4 Operating leases(2) 345 49 103 54 139 Uncertain tax contingencies(3) 80 80 Joint venture contributions 22 4 17 1 Pension minimum funding(4) 256 19 84 153 Other post employment benefits 42 6 10 10 16 Other compensation related obligations(5) 334 46 48 44 196 Total $ 1,218 $ 237 $ 264 $ 264 $ 453 (1)Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payments indicated in the above table. Interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted. (2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3)Uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the "Over 5 years" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. (4)The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (5)Principally deferred executive compensation.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Cash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world. Such deposits are placed with high quality institutions and the amounts invested in any single institution are limited to the extent possible in order to minimize concentration of counterparty credit risk. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, registered money market funds, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, international government securities and corporate debt securities.
