Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, "segment profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. For a reconciliation of segment profit to earnings before taxes, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Consolidated revenue of $20.8 billion in 2010 decreased compared to 2009 consolidated revenue of $22.0 billion primarily because large revenue increases in the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments were more than offset by a significant revenue decline in the Oil & Gas segment. Consolidated revenue of $22.0 billion in 2009 was essentially level with 2008 consolidated revenue of $22.3 billion. The revenue for the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments increased in 2009 when compared to the prior year, while 2009 revenue decreases occurred in the other three segments. The global recession continues to impact the near term capital investment plans of many of the companys clients across all of the companys segments except Government and the mining and metals and infrastructure business lines of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment. The timing of the expected recovery for the businesses impacted by the recession remains uncertain, though there are some signs of recovery in the Oil & Gas segment as demonstrated by significant new award activity in the latter part of 2010 and a corresponding increase in the segments backlog by the end of 2010 compared to 2009. The global recession has also resulted in a highly competitive business environment that has put increased pressure on margins. This trend is expected to continue and, in certain cases, may result in more lump sum project execution for the company. In some instances, margins are being negatively impacted by the change in the mix of work performed (e.g., a higher content of mining and metals project execution activities, which generally earn lower margins than other projects). Earnings before taxes were $560 million in 2010, down from $1.1 billion in 2009. The decrease in earnings for 2010 was primarily due to the impact of charges totaling $343 million for the Greater Gabbard Project in the United Kingdom and a charge totaling $95 million for a completed infrastructure joint venture project in California, both discussed in more detail in " Industrial & Infrastructure" below. Some of the impact of the charges for the Greater Gabbard Project and the infrastructure joint venture project was offset by improved performance in 2010 on other Industrial & Infrastructure projects in the infrastructure and mining and metals business lines. The 2010 results were also impacted by the lower 28 Table of Contents volume and associated earnings in the Oil & Gas segment due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded in 2006 through 2008 have been completed or are near completion. In addition, the earnings of the segment were impacted by slower new award activity during 2009 and the first half of 2010 related to the global recession, a decline in the demand for new capacity in the refining, petrochemical and polysilicon markets, and a highly competitive business environment that has resulted from changed market conditions. Improved performance was noted in the Government, Global Services and Power segments for 2010. The 2010 improvement in the Government segment was primarily the result of a higher level of project execution activities to support the United States Army in Afghanistan. The Global Services segments increase in profitability in 2010 compared to the prior year was primarily because the 2009 period included a $45 million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill project. The Power segment contributed higher earnings during 2010 compared to the prior year mostly due to higher contributions from the Oak Grove coal fired power project and a gas fired power plant, both in Texas. These positive results in the Power segment were offset somewhat by charges of $91 million taken in 2010 on a gas fired power project in Georgia for estimated additional costs to complete the project. The company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in 2010 when compared to 2009, primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation. Earnings before taxes were $1.1 billion in both 2009 and 2008. The 2009 segment profit of the Oil & Gas segment increased slightly from 2008, while the 2009 performance of both the Government and Power segments improved significantly. The 2009 segment profit of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment declined when compared to the prior year, primarily because 2008 included a $79 million pre tax gain from the sale of the companys joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project, partially offset by charges totaling $33 million for a fixed price telecommunications project in the United Kingdom, both discussed under " Industrial & Infrastructure" below. The 2009 performance of the Global Services segment was negatively impacted by the $45 million charge for the uncollectability of paper mill project receivable, noted above, and the effects of the recession when compared to 2008 segment results. The company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in 2009 when compared to 2008, primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation related costs, though much of this improvement was offset by a significant decrease in net interest income in 2009 due to the impact of lower interest rates. The effective tax rate was 21.2 percent, 35.5 percent and 34.4 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower 2010 rate was primarily attributable to a $152 million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses. The effective tax rate for 2008 included favorable benefits resulting from the reversal of certain valuation allowances, statute expirations and tax settlements. Factors affecting the effective tax rates for 2008 2010 are discussed further under " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation were $1.98 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $3.75 and $3.89 per diluted share in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2010 included the negative impact of the following pre tax charges previously discussed: $343 million ($1.79 per diluted share) for the Greater Gabbard Project; $95 million ($0.33 per diluted share) for the completed infrastructure joint venture project in California; and $91 million, ($0.31 per diluted share) for the gas fired power project in Georgia. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2010 also included the $152 million ($0.84 per diluted share) tax benefit described above for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter. A significant portion of this tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the Greater Gabbard Project charges on the foreign subsidiary. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2009 included a $45 million ($0.15 per diluted share) pre tax charge for the uncollectability of the paper mill project receivable in the Global Services segment noted above. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2008 reflected the positive effect of the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project ($79 million pre tax, or $0.27 per diluted share) and the negative impact of charges for the fixed price telecommunications project in the United Kingdom 29 Table of Contents ($33 million pre tax, or $0.11 per diluted share), both in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and discussed above. Consolidated new awards for 2010 were $27.4 billion, compared to $18.5 billion in 2009, and $25.1 billion in 2008. The increase in new award activity in 2010 was driven by the strength of the mining and metals business line in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and strong new award activity during the last half of the year in the Oil & Gas segment. The decrease in new award activity in 2009 was attributable to the Oil & Gas, Global Services and Power segments, offset somewhat by increased new awards in Industrial & Infrastructure and Government. Approximately 80 percent of consolidated new awards for 2010 were for projects located outside of the United States. Consolidated backlog was $34.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, $26.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $33.2 billion as of December 31, 2008. The increase in backlog during 2010 was due to the strength of the new award activity noted above in the Industrial & Infrastructure and Oil & Gas segments. The decrease in backlog during 2009 was primarily due to certain project cancellations and scope reductions, as well as work performed on existing projects outpacing new award activity. The Oil & Gas segment experienced a sharp decline in backlog in 2009, offset somewhat by an increase in Industrial & Infrastructure backlog. The global credit crisis and falling oil prices resulted in cancellations and scope reductions of certain projects in the Oil & Gas segment during 2009. The segments backlog at the end of 2009 was also negatively impacted by the end of the capacity expansion in the North American refining market. The 2009 growth in Industrial & Infrastructure backlog was driven by new award activity in the mining and metals business line. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 74 percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the United States. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate general and administrative expense and other items, see " Segment Operations" and " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply the following critical accounting policies: Engineering and Construction Contracts Contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Contracts are generally segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, and accordingly, gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered. The percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. Pre contract costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. As of December 31, 2010, 71 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while 29 percent was for fixed price, lump sum, guaranteed maximum or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance 30 Table of Contents criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages. In addition, increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions. The company recognizes revenue, but not profit, for certain significant claims when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable under ASC 605 35 25, and when the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. Recognized claims against clients amounted to $209 million and $247 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost, but not profit, associated with unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable, but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties. Generally, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership interest that requires only a small initial investment. The arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the company to share risks and /or secure specialty skills required for project execution. The company evaluates at inception each partnership and joint venture to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity ("VIE") under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810. A variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The majority of the companys partnerships and joint ventures qualify as VIEs because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in ASC 810, the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a VIE. The company also evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each VIE and consolidates the VIE if the company has both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure, distribution of profits and losses, risks, responsibilities, indebtedness, voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary. The company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary. In most cases, the company does not qualify as the primary beneficiary. When the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated. As required by ASC 810, managements assessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is continuously performed. Most of the companys partnerships and joint ventures do not meet the requirements for full consolidation and are accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting, though the equity and cost methods of accounting for the investments are also used, depending on the companys respective ownership interest, amount of influence in the VIE and other factors. Under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting, the company recognizes its proportionate share of revenue, cost and segment profit in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. 31 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. Interim testing of goodwill is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. During 2010, the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired. Deferred Taxes and Tax Contingencies Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. As of December 31, 2010, the company had deferred tax assets of $563 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $134 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $80 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The allowance for 2010 primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended by SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" (ASC 715 30). As required by ASC 715 30, the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the companys financial statements. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $50 million and $90 million for the calendar year 2011, which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required. If the discount rates were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities for the U.S. and non U.S. plans would increase by approximately $18 million and $27 million, respectively. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management. The company is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. For more information on the business segments see Item 1 "Business" above. Oil & Gas Revenue and segment profit for the Oil & Gas segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 7,740.0 $ 11,826.9 $ 12,946.3 Segment profit 344.0 729.7 723.8 32  Table of Contents Revenue and segment profit in 2010 decreased 35 percent and 53 percent, respectively, compared to 2009 due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded in 2006 through 2008 have been completed or are near completion. In addition, revenue and segment profit in 2010 were impacted by slower new award activity during 2009 and the first half of 2010. Revenue in 2009 decreased nearly 9 percent when compared to 2008 due to reduced project execution activities as many large projects within the segment neared completion. Segment profit margin was 4.4 percent in 2010 compared to 6.2 percent in 2009 and 5.6 percent in 2008. Segment profit margin in 2009 was comparatively higher than in 2010 and 2008 primarily due to the net positive impact of adjustments in 2009 for certain projects nearing completion, which were primarily due to the approval of change orders and the successful resolution of disputed items. Segment profit margin in 2010 was also impacted by lower operating leverage as business volume had contracted, along with a more competitive business environment. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $9.7 billion in 2010, $7.0 billion in 2009 and $15.1 billion in 2008. New awards in 2010 included upstream services associated with a liquefied natural gas project in Australia valued at $3.5 billion and an oil sands program in Canada valued at $2.4 billion. New awards in 2009 included a Canadian oil sands program valued at $1.8 billion and an expansion to an onshore production facility in Russia. New awards in 2008 included two refinery expansion projects in the United States valued at $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion, and a $1.0 billion polysilicon project in China. Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $14.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 compared to $11.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $21.4 billion as of December 31, 2008. In 2006 through 2008, the segment participated in an expanding market that included very large project awards in diverse geographical locations, which were well suited to the companys global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. The global recession, changing market conditions and a decline in demand for new capacity in the refining, petrochemical and polysilicon markets resulted in lower new award activity in 2009 and the first half of 2010, as well as $5.2 billion of project cancellations and scope reductions during 2009. As a consequence of this lower level of new award activity and the 2009 project cancellations and scope reductions, the segments 2010 revenue and segment profit declined when compared to the two previous years, and backlog for 2010 and 2009 was significantly less than for 2008. Although the segment continues to be impacted by some of the effects of the recession, there are indications that the segment is seeing the initial signs of a recovery as demonstrated by significant new awards in the last two quarters of 2010 and a corresponding increase in backlog by the end of 2010 compared to 2009. This recovery is expected to be stronger in certain markets outside of the United States, including the Middle East and Asia. It is anticipated that a highly competitive business environment will continue to put pressure on margins and, in certain cases, may result in more lump sum project execution for the segment. Total assets in the segment were $986 million as of December 31, 2010, $972 million as of December 31, 2009 and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2008. The higher level of total assets in 2008 compared to 2010 and 2009 was primarily to support a higher level of project execution activities. Industrial & Infrastructure Revenue and segment profit for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 6,867.2 $ 4,820.6 $ 3,470.3 Segment profit (loss) (169.7 ) 140.4 208.2 Revenue in 2010 increased 42 percent compared to 2009 primarily due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line. Revenue in 2009 increased 39 percent from 2008 due to significant growth in the mining and metals and infrastructure business lines. 33 Table of Contents Segment profit and segment profit margin declined significantly in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the impact of significant charges for two infrastructure projects. For the Greater Gabbard Project, a $1.8 billion lump sum project to provide engineering, procurement and construction services for the clients offshore wind farm project in the United Kingdom, charges totaling $343 million were taken in the last two quarters of 2010 for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges, including material and equipment delivery issues, productivity issues and the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor. The project forecast has been revised for the cost overruns and includes substantial costs for additional maritime assets and other subcontractor costs associated with equipment installation, equipment repairs and the estimated schedule impact. Weather related delays have further impacted the schedule and project cost forecast. The company has taken a number of actions to mitigate further cost escalation and delays to the schedule, though there is uncertainty as to the potential impact on cost and schedule of any further weather related delays, the potential unavailability of maritime assets and any further productivity issues. The segment also recorded a charge of $95 million during the current year for a completed $700 million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project to provide engineering, procurement and construction services for a roadway near San Diego, California. On October 28, 2010, the company received notice of a ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against the bankrupt client entity that impairs the joint ventures ability to recover cost overruns resulting from owner directed scope changes that led to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays. As a result of the ruling, the company determined that the likelihood of collecting its claims related costs and certain other amounts it is due is no longer considered probable. The charges for the Greater Gabbard Project and the infrastructure joint venture project were offset somewhat by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year, including $16 million of fees earned at financial closing for an infrastructure rail project, $13 million for the final negotiated settlement and closeout of both an infrastructure road project and an infrastructure telecommunications project, and $11 million for the approval of a significant change order for another infrastructure road project. In addition, there were increased contributions in segment profit for the current year compared to last year due to a significantly higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line noted above. Segment profit and segment profit margin for 2009 declined compared to 2008 primarily because the 2008 period included a pre tax gain of $79 million from the sale of the companys joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project, offset somewhat by the impact of 2008 charges totaling $33 million related to the London Connect Project. Segment profit margin in 2009 was also negatively impacted as the result of a significant shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering and feasibility studies to lower margin construction activities in the manufacturing and life sciences and mining and metals business lines, the continuation of the downturn in the life sciences market and reduced margins on Greater Gabbard Project execution activities in the infrastructure business line. In addition, the segment experienced lower margins in 2009 as the result of the consolidation of a large mining project joint venture in which the segment reports all of the joint ventures revenue, but only the segments share of the joint ventures profit. Revenue of $1.5 billion and $34 million was recognized for this project in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company is involved in a dispute in connection with the Greater Gabbard Project. The dispute relates to the companys claim for additional compensation for schedule and cost impacts arising from delays in the fabrication of monopiles and transition pieces, and disruption and productivity issues associated with construction activities and weather related delays. The company believes the schedule and cost impacts are attributable to the client and other third parties. As of December 31, 2010, the company had recorded $176 million of claim revenue related to this issue for costs incurred to date. Significant additional project costs related to the claim are expected to be incurred in future quarters and, as a result, claim revenue will increase during the life of the project. The company believes the ultimate recovery of incurred and future costs related to the claim is probable under ASC 605 35 25. The company will continue to periodically evaluate its position and the amount recognized in revenue with respect to this claim. The company participated in a 50/50 joint venture for a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in California. This joint venture project was adversely impacted by higher costs due to owner 34 Table of Contents directed scope changes leading to quantity growth, cost escalation, additional labor and schedule delays. As noted above, during 2010, the segment recorded a charge of $95 million after an adverse ruling on the priority of the joint ventures claims against the bankrupt client entity. As of December 31, 2009, the company had recognized in cost and revenue its $52 million proportionate share of $104 million of cost relating to claims recognized by the joint venture. Total claims related costs incurred, as well as claims submitted to the client by the joint venture, were in excess of the $104 million of recognized cost. The $95 million charge included amounts for the $52 million of claim revenue and the companys proportionate share of liquidated damages ($26 million), draw downs against letters of credit ($7 million) and certain other assets ($10 million). The project opened to traffic in November 2007 and reached construction completion in the second quarter of 2009. The company continues to evaluate claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project and continues to incur legal expenses associated with the claims and dispute resolution process. The company was involved in dispute resolution proceedings in connection with the London Connect Project, a $500 million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows transmission and reception throughout the London Underground system. The project, which is now complete, was subject to significant delays, resulting in additional costs to the company and claims against the client. As mentioned previously, during 2008, charges of $33 million were recognized as the result of reassessments of the remaining time and cost to complete the project and the probability of recovery of liquidated damages and certain claims. In 2009, the company settled the dispute with no material change to segment profit. As a result of the settlement, the company did not report claim revenue for the project at the end of 2010 and 2009, which totaled $105 million as of December 31, 2008. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $12.5 billion during 2010, $6.8 billion during 2009 and $5.0 billion during 2008. The increased new award activity in 2010 was primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line, with significant contributions from the infrastructure business line. The new awards in 2010 included an aluminum program in Saudi Arabia valued at $3.4 billion, a $1.4 billion copper mine in Chile and $1.7 billion for an infrastructure rail project in the United States. New awards during 2009 were driven by the mining and metals business line, including a $2.9 billion iron ore project in Australia and a $2.2 billion nickel project in Canada. New awards during 2008 reflected substantial activity in mining and metals and also included the infrastructure business lines Greater Gabbard Project. Ending backlog for the segment increased to $16.9 billion for 2010 from $10.2 billion for 2009 and $6.7 billion for 2008. The growth in backlog during 2010 was driven by the substantial new award activity in the mining and metals business line. The growth in backlog during 2009 was the result of the significant new award activity for the year and project adjustments of $1.5 billion. The project adjustments were primarily due to the positive impact on backlog of a weakening U.S. dollar for projects awarded in other currencies and revisions to project cost, mainly for customer furnished materials and the Greater Gabbard Project. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $535 million as of December 31, 2010 compared to $676 million as of December 31, 2009 and $536 million as of December 31, 2008. The decrease in total assets in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a reduction in work in process on the Greater Gabbard Project with the installation of certain offshore materials and the write off of the investment for the infrastructure joint venture project in California. The increase in total assets in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in working capital and other assets to support the Greater Gabbard Project and the increased volume of the segment. 35 Table of Contents Government Revenue and segment profit for the Government segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 3,038.0 $ 1,983.2 $ 1,319.9 Segment profit 142.2 116.8 52.2 Revenue for the Government segment in 2010 and 2009 increased 53 percent and 50 percent compared to 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily due to the execution of Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ("LOGCAP IV") task orders for the United States Army in Afghanistan. Revenue growth in both 2010 and 2009 for the Savannah River Site Management and Operating Project ("the Savannah River Project") in South Carolina and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA") funded work at Savannah River was offset by a decrease in revenue at the Hanford Environmental Management Project ("the Hanford Project") in the state of Washington, which was completed in 2009. Segment profit for the Government segment during 2010 and 2009 increased 22 percent and 124 percent compared to 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily as the result of additional work associated with LOGCAP IV task orders. The increase in segment profit in 2009 compared to 2008 was also due to improved contributions from the Savannah River Project, project execution activities associated with ARRA funding at Savannah River and $15.3 million of income related to awards for equitable adjustment on a fixed price contract at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. The higher segment profit in 2009 was offset somewhat by reduced contributions for the Hanford Project and Iraq related work. The company performed work on 11 embassy projects over the last seven years for the U.S. Department of State under fixed priced contracts. These projects were adversely impacted by higher costs due to schedule extensions, scope changes causing material deviations from the Standard Embassy Design, increased costs to meet client requirements for additional security cleared labor, site conditions at certain locations, subcontractor and teaming partner difficulties and the availability and productivity of construction labor. The last of the embassy projects was completed in 2008, with some warranty items for one project still ongoing. As of December 31, 2010, aggregate costs totaling $33 million relating to claims on two of the embassy projects had been recognized in revenue. Total claims related costs incurred to date, along with claims for equitable adjustment submitted or identified, exceed the amount recorded in claims revenue. As the first formal step in dispute resolution, all claims have been certified in accordance with federal contracting requirements. The company continues to periodically evaluate its position with respect to these claims. New awards in the Government segment were $2.8 billion during 2010, compared to $2.3 billion during 2009 and $1.4 billion during 2008. Significant new awards for 2010 included LOGCAP IV task orders, which drove the increase in new award activity compared to 2009, and the annual funding for the Savannah River Project. Significant new awards for 2009 included the annual funding for the Savannah River Project, the multi year ARRA funding at Savannah River and LOGCAP IV task orders. The increase in new awards in 2009 was primarily due to the multi year funding of ARRA work at Savannah River and LOGCAP IV task orders. The Savannah River Projects transitional work and first full year of operations were included as a new award in 2008. The company reports new awards for LOGCAP IV as individual task orders are awarded and funded. Backlog for the segment was $751 million as of December 31, 2010, $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $804 million as of December 31, 2008. The higher backlog in 2009 compared to both 2010 and 2008 was primarily due to the multi year funding at Savannah River that was a new award in 2009 and that was partially worked off by the end of 2010. Table of Contents Total assets in the Government segment were $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010, $660 million as of December 31, 2009 and $326 million as of December 31, 2008. The increase in total assets in both 2010 and 36 Table of Contents 2009 corresponded to an increase in working capital to support project execution activities, particularly for LOGCAP IV task orders. Global Services Revenue and segment profit for the Global Services segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 1,508.6 $ 1,578.1 $ 2,244.6 Segment profit 133.3 106.6 190.3 Revenue for the Global Services segment decreased 4 percent during 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in the equipment business lines Iraq business activities. This revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup in the operations and maintenance business line. The 30 percent decrease in revenue in 2009 when compared to 2008 is primarily due to declining volumes of capital work and fewer refinery turnarounds and shutdowns. The segment began to be impacted by the global recession during the fourth quarter of 2008, particularly for natural resource prospects. In certain cases, refinery turnaround and shutdown work previously awarded to the operations and maintenance business line continues to be performed internally by the clients themselves. All of the business lines of the segment continue to be affected by the weak economy and it remains unclear as to when a broad based recovery will occur. Segment profit for the segment increased 25 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily because the prior year period included a $45 million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill where the companys scope of work was to recommission, start up and operate the facility. Segment profit in 2010 benefitted from the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup activities, though the resulting positive contribution was more than offset by the overall weak economic conditions impacting all business lines, including the continued delay and reduction in capital work and maintenance activities in the operations and maintenance business line and reduced activity in the domestic and European operations of the temporary staffing business line. Segment profit declined 44 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 because of the $45 million charge for the paper mill receivable noted above and the impact of the economic and market conditions mentioned previously on the operations and maintenance, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines. Segment profit margin in the Global Services segment was 8.8 percent, 6.8 percent and 8.5 percent for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower 2009 segment profit margin was due to the factors that impacted segment profit noted above. New awards in the Global Services segment were $1.6 billion during 2010, $903 million during 2009 and $1.8 billion during 2008. New awards in 2010 included additional work from existing clients, including IBM and SAPREF of South Africa. The decline in new awards in 2009 compared to 2008 was indicative of the economic and market conditions discussed above. New awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients Backlog for the Global Services segment was $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $1.8 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The increase in backlog at the end of 2010 related to the higher level of new awards in 2010. Operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise Global Services backlog. Short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog. In addition, the equipment, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards. Total assets in the Global Services segment were $824 million as of December 31, 2010 compared to $745 million as of December 31, 2009 and $715 million as of December 31, 2008. The increase in the segments total assets in 2010 and 2009 was due to an increase in working capital to support projects in the 37 Table of Contents operations and maintenance business line, additional working capital to support ongoing equipment transactions and an expansion of the equipment fleet to support long term agreements. Power Revenue and segment profit for the Power segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue $ 1,695.5 $ 1,781.5 $ 2,344.8 Segment profit 170.9 157.7 114.4 Power segment revenue in 2010 and 2009 decreased 5 percent and 24 percent compared to 2009 and 2008, respectively, primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on the Oak Grove coal fired power project in Texas for Luminant, a unit of Energy Futures Holdings Corporation, which reached final completion in 2010. Also in 2010, revenue increases associated with project execution activities on gas fired power plant projects located in Texas, Virginia and Georgia were largely offset by a decline in revenue due to reduced volume on various other projects progressing toward completion. Segment profit in 2010 increased 8 percent compared to 2009 primarily due to increased contributions from the Oak Grove project as a result of reaching final completion and acceptance and achieving contractual performance guarantees, along with improved performance from a gas fired power plant project in Texas. These positive results were partially offset by charges of $91 million taken in 2010 on a gas fired power project in Georgia for estimated additional costs to complete the project. Segment profit in 2009 increased compared to 2008 primarily due to increased activity on several gas turbine projects, increased pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in Texas and project completion adjustments for two emissions control programs. In addition, segment profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by a provision for an uncollectible retention receivable of $9 million for the long completed Rabigh Combined Cycle Power Plant in Saudi Arabia. Segment profit margin in the Power segment was 10.1 percent, 8.9 percent and 4.9 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fluctuations in segment profit margin are explained by the same factors that impacted segment profit, discussed above. The Power segment continues to be impacted by delays in obtaining air permits for coal fired power plants due to concerns over carbon emissions. In addition, power producers have been impacted by the global recession and continuing reduced demand. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount, but occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $757 million in 2010 included work for nuclear preconstruction services and the renewal of the Luminant system wide fossil maintenance program in Texas. New awards of $1.3 billion in 2009 included the Dominion Bear Garden gas fired plant in Virginia and nuclear preconstruction services. New awards of $1.7 billion in 2008 include a gas fired power plant in Texas, expansions to an existing emissions control retrofit program in Kentucky and an emissions control retrofit program in Texas for Luminant. Backlog for the Power segment was $972 million as of December 31, 2010, $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2008. The decline in backlog since 2009 is primarily because the work performed on the Oak Grove project, major gas fired power plant projects in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, and certain other projects was not replaced by new award activity. Total assets in the Power segment decreased to $97 million as of December 31, 2010 from $171 million as of December 31, 2009 and $178 million as of December 31, 2008 due to a reduction in working capital for project execution activities, including the Oak Grove project. 38  Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, corporate general and administrative expenses were $156 million, $179 million and $230 million, respectively. The decrease in 2010 was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation. The decrease in 2009 corporate general and administrative expenses compared to 2008 was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower compensation costs, offset somewhat by foreign currency losses and other factors. Corporate general and administrative expense included $2 million of non operating expense in both 2010 and 2009, and $18 million of non operating expense in 2008, of which $16 million is for a loss on the sale of a building and the associated legal entity in the United Kingdom. Net interest income was $11 million, $14 million and $48 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in 2010 and 2009 net interest income compared to 2008 was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, offset partially by the cumulative increase in the balance of cash and marketable securities, with some of the latter being noncurrent. Tax The effective tax rates on the companys pretax earnings were 21.2 percent, 35.5 percent and 34.4 percent for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower 2010 rate was primarily attributable to a $152 million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses. A significant portion of the $152 million tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the 2010 Greater Gabbard Project charges on the foreign subsidiary. The effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by the reversal of certain valuation allowances of $19 million and statute expirations and tax settlements of $28 million. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution Conex International v. Fluor Enterprises, Inc. In November 2006, a Jefferson County, Texas, jury reached an unexpected verdict in the case of Conex International ("Conex") v. Fluor Enterprises Inc. ("FEI"), ruling in favor of Conex and awarding $99 million in damages related to a 2001 construction project. In 2001, Atofina (now part of Total Petrochemicals Inc.) hired Conex International to be the mechanical contractor on a project at Atofinas refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. FEI was also hired to provide certain engineering advice to Atofina on the project. There was no contract between Conex and FEI. Later in 2001 after the project was complete, Conex and Atofina negotiated a final settlement for extra work on the project. Conex sued FEI in September 2003, alleging damages for interference and misrepresentation and demanding that FEI should pay Conex the balance of the extra work charges that Atofina did not pay in the settlement. Conex also asserted that FEI interfered with Conexs contract and business relationship with Atofina. The jury verdict awarded damages for the extra work and the alleged interference. The company appealed the decision and the judgment against the company was reversed in its entirety in December 2008. Both parties appealed the decision to the Texas Supreme Court, and the Court denied both petitions. The company requested rehearing on two issues to the Texas Supreme Court, and that request was denied. The Court remanded the matter back to the trial court for a new trial. Based upon the present status of this matter, the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred. Fluor Corporation v. Citadel Equity Fund Ltd. Citadel Equity Fund Ltd., a hedge fund and former investor in the companys 1.5 percent Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes"), has disputed the calculation of the number of shares of the companys common stock that were due to Citadel upon conversion of approximately $58 million of Notes. Citadel has argued that it is entitled to an additional $28 million in value under its proposed calculation method. The company believes that the payout given to Citadel was proper and correct and that Citadels claims are 39 without merit. In January 2010, the court agreed with the company by granting the companys motion for summary judgment in its entirety. In February 2010, the court entered judgment in favor of the company, and Citadel filed a notice of appeal. A hearing on the appeal occurred on February 2, 2011, and on February 22, 2011, the court of appeals affirmed the district courts decision in favor of the company. Based upon the present status of this matter, the company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss will be incurred. Other As of December 31, 2010, a number of matters relating to completed and in progress projects are in the dispute resolution process. These include the Greater Gabbard Project and a completed infrastructure joint venture project in California, which are discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure", and certain embassy projects, which are discussed above under " Government." Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and access to financial markets. In addition, the company has committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling $3.8 billion, which may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit and general purposes. The company believes that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, along with its unused credit capacity of $2.7 billion and substantial cash position, is sufficient to fund operating requirements. However, the company regularly reviews its sources and uses of liquidity and may pursue opportunities to increase its liquidity positions in favorable market conditions. The companys conservative financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings, resulting in continued access to the financial markets. As of December 31, 2010, the company was in compliance with all its covenants related to its debt agreements. The companys total debt to total capitalization ("debt to capital") ratio as of December 31, 2010 was 3.2 percent compared to 3.7 percent as of December 31, 2009. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents combined with current and noncurrent marketable securities were $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $551 million, $905 million and $992 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities for both 2010 and 2009 resulted primarily from earnings sources and was reduced in 2010 for amounts funded for the losses on the Greater Gabbard Project and the gas fired power project in Georgia, and in 2009 for the claim on the Greater Gabbard Project. Cash provided by operating activities during 2008 resulted primarily from earning sources and customer advance billings. The reduced cash flow from operating activities in 2010 is primarily attributable to the funding of the two project losses noted above. Cash provided by operating activities during 2009 decreased compared to 2008 due to higher cash payments related to income taxes, somewhat offset by lower contributions into the companys defined benefit pension plans. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects as well as the companys volume of work and the execution of its projects within budget. Certain projects receive advance payments from clients. A normal trend for these projects is to have higher cash balances during the initial phases of execution which then level out toward the end of the construction phase. Project working capital requirements will vary by project. The companys cash position is reduced as customer advances are used in project execution, unless they are replaced by advances on new projects. The company maintains short 40 term borrowing facilities to satisfy any net operating cash outflows, in the event there is an investment in operating assets that exceeds the projects available cash balances. During 2010 and 2009, the company had net cash outlays of $277 million and $243 million, respectively, for the loss and claim related to the Greater Gabbard Project as discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure." Income tax payments of $202 million in 2010 were lower than income taxes paid in 2009 of $418 million primarily due to the prepayment of 2010 taxes in 2009, as well as lower tax payments resulting from a worthless stock deduction that was due to the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter. Income tax payments increased from $320 million in 2008 to $418 million in 2009 as a result of increased tax liabilities and the prepayment of some 2010 income taxes. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Contributions into the defined contribution plans of $96 million during 2010 were comparable to 2009 and 2008 contributions of $99 million and $98 million, respectively. The company contributed $43 million, $34 million and $190 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower contributions in 2010 and 2009 were due to improved financial markets. The $190 million of contributions in 2008 were a result of adverse financial market conditions coupled with the business objective to utilize available resources to generally maintain full funding of accumulated benefits. As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, all plans were funded at least to the level of accumulated benefits. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities amounted to $218 million and $23 million in 2010 and 2008, respectively, while cash utilized by investing activities amounted to $818 million in 2009. The primary investing activities during 2010, 2009 and 2008 included purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; capital expenditures; and disposals of property, plant and equipment. Investing activities in 2008 also included the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project. The company holds cash in bank deposits and marketable securities which are governed by the companys investment policy. This policy focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield. These investments include money market funds which invest in U.S. Government related securities, bank deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. Government related securities, high grade commercial paper and high quality short term and medium term fixed income securities. During 2010 and 2008, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by $438 million and $211 million, respectively. During 2009, purchases of marketable securities exceeded proceeds by $623 million. The company held current and noncurrent marketable securities of $472 million and $939 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2010, 2009 and 2008 included capital expenditures of $265 million, $233 million and $300 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during 2010, 2009 and 2008 included significant outflows related to the equipment business line of the Global Services segment, as well as investments in computer infrastructure upgrades and the refurbishment of facilities. Capital expenditures in future years are currently expected to be similar in nature and amount as in prior years. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2010 included $54 million primarily related to the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment operations in the Global Services segment compared to $38 million and $48 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2008 include proceeds of $79 million from the sale of the joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard Project. 41 Financing Activities Cash utilized from financing activities during 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $390 million, $323 million and $270 million, respectively, included company stock repurchases, company dividend payments to shareholders, convertible note repayments, distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests and corporate owned life insurance loan repayments. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in open market or negotiated transactions. On November 4, 2010, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the companys share repurchase program of 7.2 million shares, bringing the total number of shares available for repurchase to 12 million shares. The company repurchased 3,079,600 shares, 3,060,000 shares and 6,000 shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program resulting in cash outflows of $175.1 million, $125.4 million and $0.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The maximum number of shares that could still be purchased under the existing repurchase program is 9.3 million shares. In the first quarter of 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividends payable to $0.125 per share. Dividends in the amount of $90 million were paid in 2010 and 2008, respectively. Dividends in the amount of $91 million were paid in 2009. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. The payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. In February 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes") due February 15, 2024 and received proceeds of $323 million, net of underwriting discounts. Proceeds from the Notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of engineering and corporate office facilities in California through payoff of the lease financing. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the Notes in cash. Notes are convertible during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of the companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 percent of the conversion price in effect on that 30th trading day (the "trigger price"). The trigger price is currently $36.20, but is subject to adjustment as outlined in the indenture. The trigger price condition was satisfied during the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 and the Notes have therefore been classified as short term debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. During 2010, holders converted $13 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 184,563 shares of the companys common stock. During 2009, holders converted $24 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 253,309 shares of the companys common stock. During 2008, holders converted $174 million of the Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 4,058,792 shares of the companys common stock. The company does not know the timing or principal amount of the remaining Notes that may be presented for conversion in future periods. Holders of Notes will be entitled to require the company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount plus unpaid interest on February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019. The Notes are currently redeemable at the option of the company, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change of control of the company, each holder may require the company to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The carrying value amount of the Notes was $97 million and $110 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Available cash balances will be used to satisfy any principal and interest payments. Shares of the companys common stock will be issued to satisfy any appreciation between the conversion price and the market price on the date of conversion. Distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests represent cash outflows to partners of consolidated partnerships or joint ventures created primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. Distributions paid were $84 million, $76 million and $24 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The significant increase in 2010 and 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the Rapid Growth 42 Project and the Interstate 495 Capital Beltway Project which are discussed at "Note 13. Variable Interest Entities." During 2010, the company repaid $32 million in principal related to loans against the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies. On December 15, 2008, the company registered shares of its common and preferred stock, debt securities and warrants pursuant to its filing of a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash Unrealized translation gains and losses resulting from changes in functional currency exchange rates are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss. During 2010 and 2009, functional currency exchange rates for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains. During 2008, functional currency exchange rates for most of the companys international operations weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation losses. Unrealized gains of $68 million and $89 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and unrealized losses of $85 million in 2008 relate to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash. The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements On December 14, 2010, the company entered into a $1.2 billion Revolving Performance Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ("Letter of Credit Facility") that matures in 2015 and an $800 million Revolving Loan and Financial Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ("Revolving Credit Facility") that matures in 2013. Borrowings on the $800 million Revolving Credit Facility are to bear interest at rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable borrowing margin. The Letter of Credit Facility may be increased up to an additional $500 million subject to certain conditions. Previously, the company had a $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility that was terminated and all outstanding letters of credit were assigned or transferred to the Letter of Credit Facility or to the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2010, the company had a combination of committed and uncommitted lines of credit that totaled $3.8 billion. These lines may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit or general purposes. The committed lines consist of the two new facilities discussed above, as well as a $500 million letter of credit facility that matures in 2014. Letters of credit are provided to clients and other third parties in the ordinary course of business to meet bonding requirements. As of December 31, 2010, $1.1 billion in letters of credit were outstanding under these lines of credit. The company posts surety bonds as generally required by commercial terms of the contracts, primarily to guarantee its performance on state and local government projects. Guarantees, Inflation and Variable Interest Entities Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated and consolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. Amounts that may be required to be 43 paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. Performance guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2010 are estimated to be $4.9 billion. The company assessed its performance guarantee obligation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (ASC 460) and the carrying value of the liability was not material. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix the companys cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the company forms partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. The company evaluates each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a VIE. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, the company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and needs to consolidate the entity. For further discussion of the companys VIEs, see Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies above and "13. Variable Interest Entities" below in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 44  Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2010 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 2 3 years 4 5 years Over 5 years (in millions) Debt: 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes $ 97 $ 97 $ $ $ 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Interest on debt obligations(1) 9 2 2 2 3 Operating leases(2) 305 44 88 54 119 Uncertain tax contingencies(3) 68 68 Joint venture contributions 24 6 13 5 Pension minimum funding(4) 253 15 89 149 Other post employment benefits 38 6 10 8 14 Other compensation related obligations(5) 353 41 56 51 205 Total $ 1,165 $ 211 $ 258 $ 269 $ 427 (1)Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payments indicated in the above table. Interest relating to possible future debt issuances is excluded since an accurate outlook of interest rates and amounts outstanding cannot be reasonably predicted. (2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3)Uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the "Over 5 years" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. (4)The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (5)Principally deferred executive compensation.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Cash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world. Such deposits are placed with high quality institutions and the amounts invested in any single institution are limited to the extent possible in order to minimize concentration of counterparty credit risk. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, registered money market funds, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, international government securities and corporate debt securities. The company has not incurred any credit risk losses related to deposits in cash and marketable securities. The company limits exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. However, in cases where revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency, the company hedges its exposure, if material, as discussed below. 45 Table of Contents The company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate certain financial exposure, including currency and commodity price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts. The company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2010, the company had foreign exchange forward contracts of less than one year duration and a total gross notional amount of $155 million. As of December 31, 2010, the company had commodity swap forward contracts of less than three years duration and a total gross notional amount of $38 million. The companys historical gains and losses associated with derivative instruments have been immaterial. The companys long term debt obligations carry a fixed rate coupon and its exposure to interest rate risk is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations.
