Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. For purposes of reviewing this document, "segment profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non operating income and expense items. For a reconciliation of segment profit to earnings before taxes, see "15. Operations by Business Segment and Geographical Area" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations Summary of Overall Company Results Consolidated revenue for 2011 increased 12 percent to a record $23.4 billion from $20.8 billion for 2010 principally due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment, as well as revenue growth in the Oil & Gas, Government and Global Services segments. This revenue growth was partially offset by the significant revenue decline in the Power segment in 2011. Consolidated revenue for 2010 decreased five percent to $20.8 billion from $22.0 billion for 2009 primarily due to a significant revenue decline in the Oil & Gas segment which was partially offset by large revenue increases in the Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. The generally sluggish global economy and the uncertain economic conditions in Europe and other markets have resulted in a highly competitive business environment that has continued to put increased pressure on margins. This trend is expected to continue and, in certain cases, may result in more lump sum project execution for the company. In some instances, margins are being negatively impacted by the change in the mix of work performed (e.g., a higher mix of construction related work and a higher content of customer furnished materials, which typically generate lower margins than engineering work or projects without customer furnished materials). Earnings before taxes for 2011 increased 79 percent to $1.0 billion from $560 million in 2010. Earnings for the 2011 period increased primarily due to a reduced level of project charges compared to 2010. During 2010, the company recorded significant charges for two infrastructure projects, both discussed in more detail in " Industrial & Infrastructure" below. First, for the Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm ("Greater Gabbard") Project, a $1.8 billion lump sum project to provide engineering, procurement and construction services for the clients offshore wind farm project in the United Kingdom, charges totaling $343 million were taken in 2010 for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges that 29 Table of Contents impacted the schedule and project cost forecast, including material and equipment delivery issues, productivity issues, the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor and weather related delays. The company also recorded a charge of $95 million during the prior year after an adverse bankruptcy court ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against a bankrupt client entity for a completed $700 million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project near San Diego, California. During 2011, the company recorded additional charges for the Greater Gabbard Project totaling $60 million, primarily due to increased costs associated with the installation of subsea cable and schedule delays related to adverse weather conditions. The 2011 results were also positively impacted by improved performance in the mining and metals business line of the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and the Global Services segment, offset somewhat by lower earnings in the Power and Oil & Gas segments. Earnings before taxes were $560 million in 2010, down from $1.1 billion in 2009. The decrease in earnings for 2010 was primarily due to the impact of charges totaling $343 million for the Greater Gabbard Project and a charge totaling $95 million for the completed infrastructure joint venture project in California. Some of the impact of the charges for the Greater Gabbard Project and the infrastructure joint venture project was offset by improved performance in 2010 on other Industrial & Infrastructure projects in the infrastructure and mining and metals business lines. The 2010 results were also impacted by the lower volume and associated earnings in the Oil & Gas segment due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded in 2006 through 2008 had been completed or were near completion. In addition, the earnings of the segment were impacted by slower new award activity during 2009 and the first half of 2010 related to the global recession, a decline in the demand for new capacity in the refining, petrochemical and polysilicon markets, and a highly competitive business environment that resulted from changed market conditions. Improved performance was noted in the Government, Global Services and Power segments for 2010. The 2010 improvement in the Government segment was primarily the result of a higher level of project execution activities to support the United States Army in Afghanistan. The Global Services segments increase in profitability in 2010 compared to the prior year was primarily because the 2009 period included a $45 million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill project. The Power segment contributed higher earnings during 2010 compared to the prior year mostly due to higher contributions from the Oak Grove coal fired power project and a gas fired power plant, both in Texas. These positive results in the Power segment were offset somewhat by charges of $91 million taken in 2010 on a gas fired power project in Georgia for estimated additional costs to complete the project. The company reported lower corporate general and administrative expense in 2010 when compared to 2009, primarily as a result of overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation. The effective tax rate was 30.3 percent, 21.2 percent and 35.5 percent for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of various disputed items. The lower 2010 rate was primarily attributable to a $152 million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses. Factors affecting the effective tax rates for 2009 2011 are discussed further under " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation were $3.40 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $1.98 and $3.75 per diluted share in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2011 reflected the additional pre tax charges of $60 million ($0.21 per diluted share) for the Greater Gabbard Project noted above. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2010 included the negative impact of the following pre tax charges previously discussed: $343 million ($1.79 per diluted share) for the Greater Gabbard Project; $95 million ($0.33 per diluted share) for the completed infrastructure joint venture project in California; and $91 million ($0.31 per diluted share) for the gas fired power project in Georgia. Net earnings attributable to Fluor Corporation in 2010 also included the $152 million ($0.84 per diluted share) tax benefit described above for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter. A significant portion of this tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the Greater Gabbard Project charges on the foreign subsidiary. Net earnings attributable to Fluor 30 Table of Contents Corporation in 2009 included a $45 million ($0.15 per diluted share) pre tax charge for the uncollectability of the paper mill project receivable in the Global Services segment noted above. Consolidated new awards for 2011 were $26.9 billion compared to $27.4 billion in 2010 and $18.5 billion in 2009. New award activity in 2011 and 2010 were driven by the strength of the mining and metals business line in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and the Oil & Gas segment. The lower level of new awards in 2009 was primarily attributable to the global recession, though the Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure segments were still the principal drivers of the new award activity for the company. Approximately 84 percent of consolidated new awards for 2011 were for projects located outside of the United States. Consolidated backlog was $39.5 billion as of December 31, 2011, $34.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, and $26.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. The increase in backlog during 2011 and 2010 was due to the strength of the new award activity noted above in the Industrial & Infrastructure and Oil & Gas segments. Backlog was lower at the end of 2009 primarily because of the impact of the global recession on new award activity, as well as certain project cancellations and scope reductions attributable to the global credit crisis and falling oil prices. The Industrial & Infrastructure and Oil & Gas segments made up the vast majority of backlog for all three years, but at lower levels in 2009 compared to both 2010 and 2011. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 78 percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the United States. For a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment, corporate general and administrative expense and other items, see " Segment Operations" and " Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies The companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The companys significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates. Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the following critical accounting policies: Engineering and Construction Contracts Contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Contracts are generally segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, and accordingly, gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered. The percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete for contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. Changes in total estimated contract cost and losses, if any, are recognized in the period they are determined. Pre contract costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the companys engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee. As of December 31, 2011, 85 percent of the companys backlog was cost reimbursable while 15 percent was for fixed price, lump sum, guaranteed maximum or unit price contracts. In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria. Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages. In addition, increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects. 31 Table of Contents Claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients, and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions. The company recognizes revenue, but not profit, for certain significant claims when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605 35 25, these requirements are satisfied when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the companys performance, claim related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. Recognized claims against clients amounted to $298 million and $209 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cost, but not profit, associated with unapproved change orders is accounted for in revenue when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price. In circumstances where recovery is considered probable, but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated, cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only to the extent that costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred. Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate. Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties. Generally, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less ownership interest that requires only a small initial investment. The arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the company to share risks and /or secure specialty skills required for project execution. The company evaluates at inception each partnership and joint venture to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity ("VIE") under ASC 810. A variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The majority of the companys partnerships and joint ventures qualify as VIEs because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in ASC 810, the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a VIE. The company also evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each VIE and consolidates the VIE if the company has both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure, distribution of profits and losses, risks, responsibilities, indebtedness, voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary. The company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary. In most cases, the company does not qualify as the primary beneficiary. When the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated. As required by ASC 810, managements assessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is continuously performed. For joint ventures and partnerships in the construction industry, unless full consolidation is required, the company generally recognizes its proportionate share of revenue, cost and segment profit in its Consolidated Statement of Earnings and uses the one line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as allowed under ASC 810 10 45 14. At times, the cost and equity methods of accounting are also used, depending on the companys respective ownership interest, amount of influence 32 Table of Contents in the VIE and other factors. The most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. Interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. When testing goodwill for impairment, the company first compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment. In the second step, the company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. During 2011, the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired because the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist. An intangible asset with an indefinite life is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its fair value. As of December 31, 2011, none of the companys intangible assets with indefinite lives were impaired. Intangible assets with finite lives arise from business acquisitions and are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful lives of those assets, ranging from one to ten years. Deferred Taxes and Tax Contingencies Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys financial statements or tax returns. As of December 31, 2011, the company had deferred tax assets of $614 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $145 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $94 million. The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The allowance for 2011 primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for U.S. and non U.S. subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments. The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the companys effective tax rate on future earnings. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. Retirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," as amended by SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" (ASC 715 30). As required by ASC 715 30, the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the companys financial statements. Assumptions concerning discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period. The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors. Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to fund between $30 million and $60 million for the calendar year 2012, 33 Table of Contents which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required. If the discount rates were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities for the U.S. and non U.S. plans would increase by approximately $18 million and $26 million, respectively. Segment Operations The company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management. The company is organized into five business segments: Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Government, Global Services and Power. For more information on the business segments see "Item 1 Business" above. Oil & Gas Revenue and segment profit for the Oil & Gas segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 7,961.7 $ 7,740.0 $ 11,826.9 Segment profit 275.6 344.0 729.7 Revenue in 2011 increased three percent compared to 2010 primarily because of increased construction related activities, including a greater content of customer furnished materials for projects that were awarded in 2010. Revenue in 2010 decreased 35 percent compared to 2009 due to reduced project execution activities as a number of large projects that were awarded from 2006 through 2008 had been completed or were near completion. In addition, revenue in 2010 was impacted by slower new award activity during 2009 and the first half of 2010. Segment profit in 2011 decreased 20 percent compared to 2010 primarily because the 2010 results were favorably impacted by contributions of certain large projects that were completed or nearing completion, as well as various other large projects that achieved their peak earnings that year. In addition, 2010 segment profit was favorably impacted by the successful resolution of some disputed items and the expiration of certain warranty obligations. Segment profit in 2010 decreased 53 percent compared to 2009 due to the reduced project execution activities and reduced new awards, noted above, that also caused the decline in revenue in 2010. In addition, segment profit in 2009 included the net positive impact of close out issues for certain projects nearing completion, with the approval of change orders and the successful resolution of disputed items. Segment profit margin was 3.5 percent in 2011 compared to 4.4 percent in 2010 and 6.2 percent in 2009. The reduction in segment profit margin for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering activities to lower margin construction activities, with a corresponding higher content of customer furnished materials. The successful resolution of some disputed items and the expiration of certain warranty obligations in 2010 also contributed to the higher segment profit margin in 2010, relative to 2011. Segment profit margin was higher in 2009 than in both 2010 and 2011 primarily due to the aforementioned net positive impact of close out issues in 2009 for certain projects nearing completion. Segment profit margin in 2010 and 2011 was also negatively impacted by lower operating leverage with the contraction of business volume, along with a more competitive business environment. New awards in the Oil & Gas segment were $8.3 billion in 2011, $9.7 billion in 2010 and $7.0 billion in 2009. New awards in 2011 included a $2.7 billion grassroots petrochemicals complex in the Middle East and upstream services associated with a major open pit mine relocation project in Canada valued at $1.5 billion. New awards in 2010 included upstream services associated with a liquefied natural gas project in Australia valued at $3.5 billion and $2.4 billion for an oil sands program in Canada. New awards in 2009 included $1.8 billion for a Canadian oil sands program and also an expansion to an onshore production facility in Russia. 34  Table of Contents Backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $15.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $14.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $11.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. From 2006 through 2008, the segment participated in an expanding market that included very large project awards in diverse geographic locations, which were well suited to the companys global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position. The global recession, changing market conditions and a decline in demand for new capacity in the refining, petrochemical and polysilicon markets resulted in lower new award activity in 2009 and the first half of 2010, as well as $5.2 billion of project cancellations and scope reductions during 2009. As a consequence of this lower level of new award activity and the 2009 project cancellations and scope reductions, the segments 2010 and 2011 revenue and segment profit declined when compared to 2009. Although the market conditions for the segment have improved somewhat since the recession, a highly competitive business environment has resulted in significant pressure on margins. It is anticipated that these market conditions will continue and that the highly competitive business environment could result in continued margin pressures and more lump sum project execution for the segment. Total assets in the segment were $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2011, $986 million as of December 31, 2010 and $972 million as of December 31, 2009. The higher level of total assets in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 was primarily to meet working capital requirements to support project execution activities. Industrial & Infrastructure Revenue and segment profit for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 9,700.4 $ 6,867.2 $ 4,820.6 Segment profit (loss) 389.3 (169.7 ) 140.4 Revenue in 2011 increased 41 percent compared to 2010, and revenue in 2010 increased 42 percent from 2009, primarily due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line. Segment profit and segment profit margin increased significantly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily because the prior year included the impact of significant charges for two infrastructure projects. For the Greater Gabbard Project, charges totaling $343 million were taken in 2010 for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges that impacted the schedule and project cost forecast, including material and equipment delivery issues, productivity issues, the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor and weather related delays. The segment also recorded a charge of $95 million during the prior year third quarter after an adverse bankruptcy court ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against a bankrupt client entity for a completed $700 million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project near San Diego, California. As a result of the ruling, the company determined that the likelihood of recovering cost overruns resulting from owner directed scope changes was no longer considered probable. During 2011, the segment recorded additional charges for the Greater Gabbard Project totaling $60 million, primarily due to increased costs associated with the installation of subsea cable and schedule delays related to adverse weather conditions. Challenges in the cable installation process have been compounded by the bankruptcy of a critical subcontractor in January 2011 which forced the project to secure alternative vessels and equipment. The project forecast has been revised for the cost overruns and the company has taken a number of actions to mitigate further cost growth. The 2011 charges for the Greater Gabbard Project were offset by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year, including $20 million for forecast adjustments due to the achievement of progress milestones on two infrastructure road projects, $11 million from the closeout of an infrastructure project, $11 million of costs recovered in a settlement with the bankrupt client for the above referenced fixed price infrastructure joint venture project, and $10 million related to the favorable resolution of certain disputed items and the achievement of incentive targets on a mining project. Segment 35 Table of Contents profit in 2011 was also favorably impacted by a significantly higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line, noted above. Segment profit and segment profit margin declined significantly in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the impact of significant charges for the Greater Gabbard Project and the fixed price infrastructure joint venture project, discussed above. The 2010 charges for these two projects were offset somewhat by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year, including $16 million of fees earned at financial closing for an infrastructure rail project, $13 million for the final negotiated settlement and closeout of both an infrastructure road project and an infrastructure telecommunications project, and $11 million for the approval of a significant change order for another infrastructure road project. In addition, there were increased contributions in segment profit in 2010 when compared to 2009 due to a significantly higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line, noted above. The company is involved in a dispute in connection with the Greater Gabbard Project. The dispute relates to the companys claim for additional compensation for schedule and cost impacts arising from delays in the fabrication of monopiles and transition pieces, along with certain disruption and productivity issues associated with construction activities and weather related delays. The company believes the schedule and cost impacts are attributable to the client and other third parties. As of December 31, 2011, the company had recorded $265 million of claim revenue related to this issue for costs incurred to date. Additional costs arising from this dispute are expected to be incurred during the remaining life of the project and, as a result, claim revenue will increase accordingly. The company believes the ultimate recovery of incurred and future costs is probable under ASC 605 35 25. The company will continue to periodically evaluate its position and the amount recognized in revenue with respect to this claim. The project is expected to be substantially complete by the second quarter of 2012. However, the resolution of the claims is expected to extend beyond the completion date of the project. As of December 31, 2011, the client had also previously withheld the contractual maximum for liquidated damages related to the dispute of approximately $150 million. The company will also seek to recover in arbitration a significant portion of the withheld liquidated damages. Should the company not be successful in its pursuit of schedule relief related to certain delays covered by the claim, the liquidated damages not recovered from the client could result in a charge to earnings, as would any unrecovered claim amounts. New awards in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $12.2 billion during 2011, $12.5 billion during 2010 and $6.8 billion during 2009. New awards in 2011 were primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line, and included $6.2 billion for ongoing iron ore work in Australia, as well as a major copper project in Peru. The increased new award activity in 2010 was primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line, with significant contributions from the infrastructure business line. The new awards in 2010 included an aluminum program in Saudi Arabia valued at $3.4 billion, a $1.4 billion copper mine in Chile and $1.7 billion for an infrastructure rail project in the United States. New awards during 2009 were driven by the mining and metals business line, including a $2.9 billion iron ore project in Australia and a $2.2 billion nickel project in Canada. Ending backlog for the segment increased to $19.6 billion for 2011 from $16.9 billion for 2010 and $10.2 billion for 2009. The growth in backlog during 2011 and 2010 was driven by the substantial new award activity in the mining and metals business line. Total assets in the Industrial & Infrastructure segment were $944 million as of December 31, 2011 compared to $535 million as of December 31, 2010 and $676 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in total assets in 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to an increase in working capital to support the growth in the mining and metals business line. The decrease in total assets in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to a reduction in work in process on the Greater Gabbard Project with the installation of certain offshore materials and the write off of the investment for the fixed price infrastructure joint venture project in California. 36 Table of Contents Government Revenue and segment profit for the Government segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 3,398.2 $ 3,038.0 $ 1,983.2 Segment profit 145.5 142.2 116.8 Revenue in 2011 and 2010 increased 12 percent and 53 percent compared to 2010 and 2009, respectively, principally due to an increase in the volume of work for the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program ("LOGCAP IV") for the United States Army in Afghanistan. Project execution activities associated with the gaseous diffusion plant contract for the Department of Energy in Portsmouth, Ohio (the "Portsmouth Project"), awarded in the first quarter of 2011, also contributed to the 2011 revenue increase, though the impact was largely offset by a reduction in revenue attributable to the close out of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA") funded work at the Savannah River Site Management and Operating Project (the "Savannah River Project") in South Carolina and the completion of many task orders for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Programs Center ("CETAC") logistics program in Iraq. Revenue growth in 2010 for the Savannah River Project and ARRA funded work at the Savannah River Project site was offset by a decrease in revenue at the Hanford Environmental Management Project (the "Hanford Project") in the state of Washington, which was completed in 2009. Segment profit during 2011 and 2010 increased two percent and 22 percent compared to 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily due to additional contributions from higher levels of project execution activities on LOGCAP IV task orders. The growth in segment profit for 2011 was also attributable to the Portsmouth Project, though reduced contributions from CETAC task orders and the ARRA work at Savannah River more than offset its positive impact. Segment profit margin was 4.3 percent, 4.7 percent and 5.9 percent for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher segment profit margin in 2009 was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of disputed items and warranty obligations for the Bagram Air Base contract in Afghanistan that resulted in the recognition of $15.3 million of segment profit during the year. New awards were $3.7 billion during 2011, $2.8 billion during 2010 and $2.3 billion during 2009. The increase in new award activity in 2011 was primarily attributable to the initial contract funding for the Portsmouth Project and increased funding for LOGCAP IV task orders. New awards in 2011 also included the annual funding for the Savannah River Project. Significant new awards for 2010 included LOGCAP IV task orders, which drove the increase in new award activity compared to 2009, and the annual funding for the Savannah River Project. Significant new awards for 2009 included the annual funding for the Savannah River Project, the multi year ARRA funding at the Savannah River Project site and LOGCAP IV task orders. The company reports new awards for LOGCAP IV as individual task orders are awarded and funded. Backlog was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011, $751 million as of December 31, 2010 and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2009. The growth in backlog during 2011 was driven by the initial contract funding for the Portsmouth Project and increased funding for LOGCAP IV task orders. The higher backlog in 2009 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the multi year funding for ARRA work at the Savannah River Project site that was a new award in 2009, and partially worked off by the end of 2010. Total assets in the Government segment were $800 million as of December 31, 2011, $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $660 million as of December 31, 2009. The decrease in total assets in 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to a decrease in working capital related to the LOGCAP IV task orders. The increase in total assets in 2010 compared to 2009 corresponded to an increase in working capital to support project execution activities, particularly for LOGCAP IV task orders. 37 Table of Contents Global Services Revenue and segment profit for the Global Services segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 1,577.7 $ 1,508.6 $ 1,578.1 Segment profit 151.8 133.3 106.6 Revenue in 2011 increased five percent compared to 2010 principally due to the equipment business line which experienced a higher volume of work in Afghanistan and South America. A decrease in current year revenue attributable to the close out of the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup project in 2010 was offset by an increase in other 2011 operations and maintenance business line project execution activities and an increase in revenue in the temporary staffing business line. Revenue decreased four percent during 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in the equipment business lines Iraq business activities. This revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup in the operations and maintenance business line. Segment profit during 2011 increased 14 percent compared to 2010, primarily due to the improved performance from the equipment business line, as noted above. Increased segment profit in the current year from the temporary staffing business line was offset by a decrease in contributions from the operations and maintenance business line, the latter of which was primarily the result of the close out of the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup project in the prior year. Segment profit during 2010 increased 25 percent compared to 2009 primarily because 2009 included a $45 million charge related to the uncollectability of a client receivable for a paper mill where the companys scope of work was to recommission, start up and operate the facility. Segment profit in 2010 benefitted from the Gulf Coast oil spill cleanup activities, though the resulting positive contribution was more than offset by the overall weak economic conditions impacting all business lines, including the continued delay and reduction in capital work and maintenance activities in the operations and maintenance business line and reduced activity in the domestic and European operations of the temporary staffing business line. Segment profit margin was 9.6 percent, 8.8 percent and 6.8 percent for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Segment profit margin for 2011 was higher compared to 2010 due to improvement in margins in the equipment business lines activities in Afghanistan and South America. The lower 2009 segment profit margin was due to the factors that impacted segment profit noted above, particularly the charge related to the write off of the uncollectable receivable for the paper mill project. New awards in the Global Services segment were $1.0 billion during 2011, $1.6 billion during 2010 and $903 million during 2009. The operations and maintenance business line continues to experience lower volume with existing clients, as well as delayed new client releases. New awards for all three years included new work and renewals for key clients, such as IBM (all years), ALCOA (all years), Procter & Gamble (all years) and SAPREF of South Africa (2010). Backlog for the Global Services segment was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2011, $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. Operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise Global Services backlog. Short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog. In addition, the equipment, temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards. Total assets in the Global Services segment were $937 million as of December 31, 2011, $824 million as of December 31, 2010 and $745 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in the segments total assets in 2011 corresponded to an increase in working capital and equipment to support the equipment business line. The increase in total assets in 2010 was due to an increase in working capital to support projects in the operations and maintenance business line, additional working capital to support ongoing equipment transactions and an expansion of the equipment fleet to support long term agreements. 38 Table of Contents Power Revenue and segment profit for the Power segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 743.4 $ 1,695.5 $ 1,781.5 Segment profit 81.1 170.9 157.7 Revenue in 2011 decreased 56 percent compared to 2010 primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on several projects which have reached or are near final completion, including the Oak Grove coal fired power project in Texas for Luminant, a unit of Energy Future Holdings Corporation, gas fired power plants in Texas and Virginia, and pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in Texas, as well as reduced volume on certain other projects progressing toward completion. The segments revenue decreased five percent in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the reduction in project execution activities on the Oak Grove project which reached final completion in 2010. Also in 2010, revenue increases associated with project execution activities on gas fired power plant projects located in Texas, Virginia and Georgia were largely offset by a decline in revenue due to reduced volume on various other projects progressing toward completion. Segment profit during 2011 decreased 53 percent compared to 2010 principally due to reduced contributions from the Oak Grove project. The reduced contributions from other projects nearing completion, including the gas fired power plant project in Texas, pre construction services on the nuclear new build project in Texas and an emissions control retrofit project in South Carolina, were offset by lower charges taken for cost overruns on the gas fired power plant project in Georgia ($13 million during 2011 compared to $91 million in 2010) and improved performance on the gas fired power plant project in Virginia due to the achievement of major milestones. Segment profit in 2010 increased eight percent compared to 2009 primarily due to increased contributions from the Oak Grove project as a result of reaching final completion and acceptance and achieving contractual performance guarantees, along with improved performance from the gas fired power plant project in Texas. These positive results were partially offset by the charges taken in 2010 on the gas fired power project in Georgia, noted above. Segment profit margin in the Power segment was 10.9 percent, 10.1 percent and 8.9 percent for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fluctuations in segment profit margin from year to year are explained by the same factors that impacted revenue and segment profit, discussed above. The Power segment continues to be impacted by relatively weak demand for new power generation. Improving market opportunities include gas fired baseload generation, renewable energy, regional transmission additions and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal fired power plants. New awards in the Power segment are typically large in amount and occur on an irregular basis. New awards of $1.6 billion in 2011 included an air emissions control construction program for Luminant, a new gas fired power plant project in Texas, and a new solar power project in Arizona. New awards of $757 million in 2010 included work for nuclear preconstruction services and the renewal of the Luminant system wide fossil maintenance program in Texas. New awards of $1.3 billion in 2009 included a gas fired plant in Virginia and nuclear preconstruction services. Backlog was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2011, $972 million as of December 31, 2010 and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2009. The increase in backlog in 2011 was principally driven by the 2011 new awards mentioned in the preceding paragraph which were awarded in the latter part of the year. The decline in backlog in 2010 was primarily because the work performed on the Oak Grove project, major gas fired power plant projects in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, and certain other projects was not replaced by new award activity of equal or greater value. Total assets in the Power segment were $191 million as of December 31, 2011, $97 million as of December 31, 2010 and $171 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in the segments total assets in 2011 was attributable to an increase in work in process for the purchase of certain solar power plant 39 Table of Contents equipment in advance of customer reimbursement and the consolidation of the assets of NuScale Power, a small modular nuclear reactor technology company that the company acquired a majority interest in during late 2011. The decrease in the segments total assets in 2010 was due to a reduction in working capital for project execution activities, including the Oak Grove project. Corporate, Tax and Other Matters Corporate For the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, corporate general and administrative expenses were $163 million, $156 million and $179 million, respectively. The five percent increase in 2011 corporate general and administrative expenses compared to 2010 was primarily the result of higher management incentive compensation and foreign currency losses, offset somewhat by overhead reduction efforts and other factors. The decrease in 2010 was primarily due to overhead reduction efforts and lower management incentive compensation. Corporate general and administrative expense included $14 million of non operating expense in 2011, primarily due to expenses associated with previously divested operations, and $2 million of non operating expense in both 2010 and 2009. Net interest income was $16 million, $11 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in net interest income in 2011 was due to higher cash balances in certain international locations that earn higher yields, offset partially by an increase in interest expense due to the September 2011 issuance of Senior Notes (discussed in more detail below). The lower 2010 net interest income compared to 2009 was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Tax The effective tax rate on the companys pretax earnings was 30.3 percent, 21.2 percent and 35.5 percent for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of various disputed items. The lower 2010 rate was primarily attributable to a $152 million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses. A significant portion of the $152 million tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the 2010 Greater Gabbard Project charges on the foreign subsidiary. Litigation and Matters in Dispute Resolution See "13. Contingencies and Commitments" below in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, credit facilities and access to financial markets. The company has committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling $3.8 billion, which may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit and general purposes. The company believes that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, along with its unused credit capacity of $2.6 billion and substantial cash position, is sufficient to fund operating requirements. However, the company regularly reviews its sources and uses of liquidity and may pursue opportunities to increase its liquidity positions in favorable market conditions. The companys conservative financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings, resulting in continued access to the financial markets. As of December 31, 2011, the company was in compliance with all its covenants related to its debt agreements. The companys total debt to total capitalization ("debt to capital") ratio as of December 31, 2011 was 13.6 percent compared to 3.2 percent as of December 31, 2010 primarily due to the companys $500 million debt issuance in September 2011 which is discussed in the financing activities section below. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents combined with current and noncurrent marketable securities were $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2010. 40 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous accounts throughout the world to fund the companys global project execution activities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States amounted to $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The company did not consider any cash to be permanently reinvested overseas as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and, as a result, has accrued the U.S. deferred tax liability on foreign earnings, as appropriate. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $890 million, $551 million and $905 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities improved in 2011 primarily due to increases in earnings sources and positive cash flows resulting from a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher retirement plan contributions. The net reduction in operating assets and liabilities during 2011 was primarily attributable to decreases in prepaid income taxes and increases in both client advances and accounts payable associated with project execution activities in the Oil & Gas segment, partially offset by increases in contract work in process. The increases in client advances and accounts payable during 2011 resulted primarily from normal project execution activities associated with numerous projects. The increase in work in process during 2011 resulted from normal project execution activities associated with numerous projects, as well as amounts funded for the losses and claim on the Greater Gabbard Project. Cash provided by operating activities declined in 2010 primarily due to lower earnings sources. Cash provided by operating activities in both 2010 and 2009 resulted primarily from earnings sources reduced by cash outflows from net increases in operating assets and liabilities. The net increase in operating assets and liabilities in 2010 resulted from a higher accounts receivable balance as well as amounts funded for the losses and claim on the Greater Gabbard Project and the gas fired power project in Georgia. The higher accounts receivable balance in 2010 was the net result of normal billing and collection activities associated with numerous projects and not indicative of any significant collection or liquidity issue. The net increase in operating assets and liabilities in 2009 pertained to increases in prepaid income taxes and contract work in process, partially offset by lower accounts receivable balances. The increase in contract work in process resulted from increases in project execution activities and costs associated with the claim on the Greater Gabbard Project. The levels of operating assets and liabilities vary from year to year and are affected by the mix, stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects, as well as the companys volume of work and the execution of its projects within budget. Certain projects receive advance payments from clients. A normal trend for these projects is to have higher cash balances during the initial phases of execution which then level out toward the end of the construction phase. Project working capital requirements will vary by project. The companys cash position is reduced as customer advances are used in project execution, unless they are replaced by advances on new projects. The company maintains cash reserves and borrowing facilities to satisfy any net operating cash outflows in the event there is an investment in operating assets that exceeds the projects available cash balances. The company had net cash outlays of $361 million, $277 million, and $243 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, to fund the project execution activities for the Greater Gabbard Project as discussed above under " Industrial & Infrastructure." Income tax payments of $177 million in 2011 were lower than income taxes paid of $202 million in 2010 primarily due to the prepayment of 2011 taxes in 2010. Income tax payments of $202 million in 2010 were lower than income taxes paid in 2009 of $418 million primarily due to the prepayment of 2010 taxes in 2009, as well as lower tax payments resulting from a worthless stock deduction that was due to the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter. A significant portion of this tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the Greater Gabbard Project charges on the foreign subsidiary. Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the companys defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Contributions into the defined contribution plans during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $109 million, $96 million and $99 million, respectively. The company contributed $122 million, $43 million and $34 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 41 Table of Contents The increase in contributions to the defined benefit pension plans during 2011 was primarily due to lower long term interest rates coupled with the business objective to generally maintain plan assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations. As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, plan assets of all of the companys more significant benefit plans exceeded accumulated benefit obligations. Investing Activities Cash utilized by investing activities amounted to $436 million and $818 million in 2011 and 2009, respectively, while cash provided by investing activities amounted to $218 million in 2010. The primary investing activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 included purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment. The company holds cash in bank deposits and marketable securities which are governed by the companys investment policy. This policy focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield. These investments include money market funds which invest in U.S. Government related securities, bank deposits placed with highly rated financial institutions, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. Government related securities, high grade commercial paper and high quality short term and medium term fixed income securities. During 2011 and 2009, purchases of marketable securities exceeded proceeds from the sales and maturities by $133 million and $623 million, respectively. During 2010, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by $438 million. The company held current and noncurrent marketable securities of $600 million and $472 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash utilized by investing activities in 2011, 2010 and 2009 included capital expenditures of $338 million, $265 million and $233 million, respectively. Capital expenditures during 2011, 2010 and 2009 included significant outflows related to the equipment business line of the Global Services segment, as well as investments in information technology and the refurbishment of facilities. Cash flows provided by investing activities include proceeds of $54 million in both 2011 and 2010 and $38 million in 2009 primarily from the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment operations in the Global Services segment. During 2011, the company paid $27 million to acquire controlling interests in both NuScale Power, LLC, an Oregon based designer of small modular nuclear reactors, and Goar, Allison & Associates, a Texas based provider of sulfur technologies for upstream gas plants, downstream refineries and gasification. Financing Activities Cash utilized by financing activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $396 million, $390 million and $323 million, respectively, included company stock repurchases, company dividend payments to stockholders, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, convertible note repayments, distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests and corporate owned life insurance loan repayments. The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the companys discretion. The company repurchased 10,050,000 shares, 3,079,600 shares and 3,060,000 shares of common stock under its current and previously authorized stock repurchase programs resulting in cash outflows of $640 million, $175 million and $125 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, 11.3 million shares could still be purchased under the existing stock repurchase program. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the companys Board of Directors authorized the payment of quarterly dividends of $0.125 per share. Dividends of $88 million, $90 million and $91 million, were paid during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Declared dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared. The payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the companys Board of Directors. On February 2, 2012, the companys Board of Directors authorized an increase in the companys quarterly dividend from $0.125 per share to $0.16 per share. 42 Table of Contents In September 2011, the company issued $500 million of 3.375 percent Senior Notes (the "2011 Notes") due September 15, 2021 and received proceeds of $492 million, net of underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs. Interest on the 2011 Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2012. The net proceeds of the 2011 Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. The company may, at any time, redeem the 2011 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount, plus a "make whole" premium described in the indenture. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined by the terms of the indenture, the company will be required to offer to purchase the 2011 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The company is generally not limited under the indenture governing the 2011 Notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness provided the company is in compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on liens and restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions. These covenants are not expected to impact the companys liquidity or capital resources. In February 2004, the company issued $330 million of 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes (the "2004 Notes") due February 15, 2024 and received proceeds of $323 million, net of underwriting discounts. Proceeds from the 2004 Notes were used to pay off the then outstanding commercial paper and $100 million was used to obtain ownership of engineering and corporate office facilities in California through payoff of the lease financing. In December 2004, the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the 2004 Notes in cash. The 2004 Notes are convertible during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of the companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 percent of the conversion price in effect on that 30th trading day (the "trigger price"). The trigger price is currently $35.83, but is subject to adjustment as outlined in the indenture. The trigger price condition was satisfied during the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2010 and the 2004 Notes were therefore classified as current as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Shares of the companys common stock are issued to satisfy any appreciation between the conversion price and the market price on the date of conversion. During 2011, holders converted $77 million of the 2004 Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 1,678,095 shares of the companys common stock. During 2010, holders converted $13 million of the 2004 Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 184,563 shares of the companys common stock. During 2009, holders converted $24 million of the 2004 Notes in exchange for the principal balance owed in cash plus 253,309 shares of the companys common stock. The company does not know the timing or principal amount of the remaining Notes that may be presented for conversion in future periods. Holders of the 2004 Notes will be entitled to require the company to purchase all or a portion of their 2004 Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount plus unpaid interest on February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019. The 2004 Notes are currently redeemable at the option of the company, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change of control of the company, each holder may require the company to repurchase the 2004 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The carrying value amount of the 2004 Notes was $19 million and $97 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests represent cash outflows to partners of consolidated partnerships or joint ventures created primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. Distributions paid were $104 million, $84 million and $76 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The significant increase in distributions in 2011 was due to the Rapid Growth Project. The increase during 2010 was due to the Rapid Growth Project and the Interstate 495 Capital Beltway Project which are discussed at "14. Variable Interest Entities." During 2010, the company repaid $32 million in principal related to loans against the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash Unrealized translation gains and losses resulting from changes in functional currency exchange rates are reflected in the cumulative translation component of other comprehensive loss. During 2011, 43 Table of Contents functional currency exchange rates for most of the companys international operations weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation losses. During 2010 and 2009, functional currency exchange rates for most of the companys international operations strengthened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in unrealized translation gains. Unrealized losses of $31 million in 2011 and unrealized gains of $68 million and $89 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash. The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore the companys exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is considered nominal. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements On December 14, 2010, the company entered into a $1.2 billion Revolving Performance Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ("Letter of Credit Facility") that matures in 2015 and an $800 million Revolving Loan and Financial Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ("Revolving Credit Facility") that matures in 2013. Borrowings on the $800 million Revolving Credit Facility are to bear interest at rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable borrowing margin. The Letter of Credit Facility may be increased up to an additional $500 million subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2011, the company had a combination of committed and uncommitted lines of credit that totaled $3.8 billion. These lines may be used for revolving loans, letters of credit or general purposes. The committed lines consist of the two facilities discussed above, as well as a $500 million letter of credit facility that matures in 2014. Letters of credit are provided in the ordinary course of business primarily to indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts. As of December 31, 2011, $1.2 billion in letters of credit were outstanding under these lines of credit. Surety bonds are also posted as an alternative form of credit enhancement. Guarantees, Inflation and Variable Interest Entities Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated and consolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts. These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump sum or fixed price contracts, the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims. Performance guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2011 were estimated to be $4.6 billion. The company assessed its performance guarantee obligation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (ASC 460) and the carrying value of the liability was not material. Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower. Most arrangements require the borrower to pledge collateral in the form of property, plant and equipment which is deemed adequate to recover amounts the company might be required to pay. 44  Table of Contents Inflation Although inflation and cost trends affect the company, its engineering and construction operations are generally protected by the ability to fix the companys cost at the time of bidding or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts. The company has taken actions to reduce its dependence on external economic conditions; however, management is unable to predict with certainty the amount and mix of future business. Variable Interest Entities In the normal course of business, the company forms partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects. The company evaluates each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a VIE. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, the company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and needs to consolidate the entity. For further discussion of the companys VIEs, see Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies above and "14. Variable Interest Entities" below in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total 1 year or less 23 years 45 years Over 5 years (in millions) Debt: 3.375% Senior Notes $ 496 $ $ $ $ 496 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes 19 19 5.625% Municipal bonds 18 18 Interest on debt obligations(1) 169 18 35 35 81 Operating leases(2) 267 39 77 51 100 Uncertain tax contingencies(3) 78 78 Joint venture contributions 35 11 4 20 Pension minimum funding(4) 77 10 20 47 Other post employment benefits 35 5 10 8 12 Other compensation related obligations(5) 341 44 65 53 179 Total $ 1,535 $ 146 $ 211 $ 214 $ 964 (1)Interest is based on the borrowings that are presently outstanding and the timing of payments indicated in the above table. (2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property. (3)Uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the "Over 5 years" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. (4)The company generally provides funding to its U.S. and non U.S. pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In managements judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated. Where minimum funding as 45 Table of Contents determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources. (5)Principally deferred executive compensation.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Cash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world. Such deposits are placed with high quality institutions and the amounts invested in any single institution are limited to the extent possible in order to minimize concentration of counterparty credit risk. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, registered money market funds, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, international government securities and corporate debt securities. The company has not incurred any credit risk losses related to deposits in cash and marketable securities. The company limits exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred. As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed. However, in cases where revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency, the company hedges its exposure, if material, as discussed below. The company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate certain financial exposure, including currency and commodity price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts, currency risk associated with intercompany transactions and risk associated with interest rate volatility. The company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2011, the company had foreign exchange forward contracts of less than one year duration and a total gross notional amount of $736 million. As of December 31, 2011, the company had commodity swap forward contracts of less than three years duration and a total gross notional amount of $12 million. The companys historical gains and losses associated with derivative instruments have been immaterial. The companys long term debt obligations carry a fixed rate coupon and its exposure to interest rate risk is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations.
