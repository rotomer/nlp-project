ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Reorganization of our Company We implemented our plan to split FMC into separate chemical and machinery companies in 2001 through a two step process. The first step included an initial public offering ("IPO") of 17 percent of our machinery businesses, named FMC Technologies, Inc. ("Technologies"), which took place in the second quarter of 2001. Technologies consists of our former Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems business segments. Subsequent to the IPO, Technologies made payments of $480.1 million to our company in exchange for the net assets distributed to Technologies on June 1, 2001, which we used to retire short term and long term debt. The second step, the distribution of our remaining 83 percent ownership in Technologies (the "spin off") occurred on December 31, 2001. Total net assets distributed on December 31, 2001 were $509.5 million. We believe that the spin off of Technologies will allow our company to focus its efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation, increased innovation and overall growth. In an effort to align our business with our future growth plans, we took various strategic measures, including the restructuring of businesses, reduction of staff, plant shutdowns and the writedown of certain underperforming assets. We believe these steps will increase our companys financial flexibility as market conditions change. Risk and our Significant Accounting Policies As would be expected, these changes in our company have altered our overall risk environment as described below and elsewhere in this report. In addition to risk factors, we have also identified and reviewed our significant accounting policies, all of which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, while noting that the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that require judgment. These estimates and assumptions can significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses at the date of our financial statements and for the reporting periods shown. Our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements are similarly affected by estimates and assumptions. 10 Some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared. For example, we provide for environmental related obligations when they are believed to be probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Also, we review the recoverability of the net book values of our investments in affiliates and, our fixed and intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable. When this is the case, we record an impairment loss. We also continually assess the return on our business segments, which sometimes results in a plan to restructure the operations of a business. When such a plan is final, we record an accrual for severance and other contractual commitments and obligations. Finally, our reserves for discontinued operations consist of obligations for discontinued operations, for environmental remediation and study obligations from some of our former chemical plant sites, and product liabilities and other potential claims, including those related to retiree medical and life insurance benefits. (See a further discussion on all of the policies in Notes 1, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.) Results of Operations General All results discussed in this analysis address the continuing operations of our chemical businesses. Technologies results have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Accordingly, the results of the Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems business segments will not be included in the results of operations discussion and analysis. Our loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $306.3 million compared to income of $125.6 million and $158.7 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, excluding special items defined below for the year ended December 31, 2001, was $99.6 million compared to $153.5 million and $132.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Special items in 2001 consisted of asset impairments and restructuring and other charges totaling $603.5 million ($405.9 million after tax). Special items in 2000 consisted of asset impairments and restructuring and other charges totaling $45.3 million ($27.9 million after tax). Special items in 1999 consisted of asset impairments, restructuring and other charges and gains on divestitures of businesses totaling a gain of $21.3 million ($26.7 million after tax). The following table displays the results for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 through a reconciliation between as reported income (loss) from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, excluding special items.

All comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue was $1,943.0 million in 2001, down from $2,050.3 million in 2000. Revenue in the United States decreased 8.6 percent compared with 2000, while revenue outside the United States, including exports, decreased 2.2 percent from 2000. Sales in the United States represented 45.4 percent of our 2001 revenue, slightly less than in 2000. Income from continuing operations, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income taxes, excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges was $99.6 million in 2001 compared to $153.5 million in 2000. This decline can be attributed to an overall economic downturn impacting the chemical industry worldwide and other factors discussed under "Segment Results" below. Asset impairments totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) for 2001 compared to $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax) in 2000. Based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets we recorded asset impairment charges of $211.9 million related to our U.S. based phosphorus business. The components of asset impairments related to this business, include a $171.0 million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") Consent Decree ("Consent Decree") at the Pocatello, Idaho facility and a $36.5 million impairment charge for our investment in Astaris, LLC ("Astaris"), our phosphorus joint venture with Solutia, Inc. ("Solutia"). (See Notes 4 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.) Driving these charges were a decline in market conditions, the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second purified phosphoric acid ("PPA") plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the Shoshone Bannock Tribes as a result of an agreement to support a proposal to amend the Consent Decree permitting the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at Pocatello. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segments lithium operations in Argentina. We established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately five years ago in a remote area of the Andes Mountains. With the entry of a South American manufacturer into this business, resulting in decreased revenues and following the continuation of other unfavorable market conditions, our lithium assets in Argentina became impaired as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered. An additional $12.3 million of charges related to the impairment of assets in our cyanide operations. During the second quarter of 2000, we recorded asset impairments of $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax). Impairments of $9.0 million were recognized because of the formation of Astaris (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), including the write down of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two phosphorus facilities. Other asset impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the Specialty Chemicals segment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our accounting policies related to asset impairments. Restructuring and other charges. A change in market conditions and in our corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) in the year. A charge of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax) was recorded in 2000. We believe that the restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001 have enabled us to engage in long term growth opportunities for all of our business segments. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our accounting policies related to restructuring and other charges. We had several minor restructuring activities related to corporate reorganization in the first quarter of 2001 totaling approximately $1.0 million. 12 During the second quarter of 2001, we recorded $175.0 million in restructuring and other charges including $160.0 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segments U.S. based phosphorus business. The components included in restructuring and other charges related to the phosphorus business were as follows: a $68.7 million reserve for further required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site; $42.7 million of financing obligations to the Astaris joint venture and other related costs; and a $40.0 million reserve for payments to the Shoshone Bannock Tribes and $8.6 million of other related charges. In addition, restructuring charges for the quarter included $8.0 million related to our corporate reorganization. The remaining charges of $7.0 million were for the restructuring of two smaller chemical facilities. We reduced our workforce by approximately 135 people in connection with these restructuring activities. During the third quarter of the year, we recorded restructuring charges of $8.5 million. These charges were largely for reorganization costs and corporate restructuring activities including severance and contract commitment costs. (See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). We recorded restructuring and other charges of $95.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Most of these charges related to our decision to shutdown operations at Pocatello. These charges include: $36.3 million for our share of Astaris shutdown costs including environmental cleanup, waste removal and other activities; also included are $44.6 million of Pocatello costs related to plant demolition, plant shutdown, severance and other activities. In addition, $12.5 million of severance and other costs related to the Agricultural Products segment were recorded primarily as a result of our decision to refocus certain research and development activities. The remaining charges reflected restructuring initiatives in our Specialty Chemicals segment and in corporate. We reduced our workforce by approximately 182 people in connection with the third and fourth quarter restructuring activities. During 2000, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax). Restructuring charges of $20.6 million were attributable to the formation of Astaris and the concurrent reorganization of our Industrial Chemicals sales, marketing and support organizations, the reduction of office space requirements in our Philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company. In addition, we recorded environmental accruals of $12.5 million because of increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties. Other restructuring charges included $2.1 million for other projects. Of the approximately 350 employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in 2000, 281 occurred at December 31, 2000 while the remainder occurred in 2001. Income (loss) from continuing operations was a loss of $306.3 million in 2001 compared to income of $125.6 million in 2000. Most of the decline can be attributed to after tax asset impairments and restructuring and other charges of $405.9 million in 2001 compared to after tax charges of $27.9 million in 2000. Also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting the chemical industry worldwide. Corporate expenses (excluding restructuring and other charges in 2001 and 2000) were $36.3 million in 2001 and $36.2 million in 2000. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other expense for the year was $1.6 million compared to net other income of $9.6 million in 2000. This variance is largely attributable to increased pension costs and lower amortization of a deferred pension asset. Net interest expense in 2001 was $58.3 million compared to $61.8 million in 2000. The decrease in net interest expense in 2001 was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during the year. 13 Provision (benefit) for income taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of $166.6 million in 2001 resulting in an effective tax rate of 35.2 percent compared to income tax expense of $33.0 million and an effective tax rate of 20.8 percent in 2000. The differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates, the impairment of certain Argentina assets, foreign sales corporation benefits, incremental state taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization. Discontinued operations. We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million after tax) in 2001. Included in this amount are earnings of Technologies, including interest expense of $11.2 million, which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 30 ("APB 30") and later relevant accounting guidance, costs related to the spin off and additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of Technologies from FMC. In addition, we recorded a charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses. During 2000, we recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $17.7 million ($15.0 million after tax). Of this amount, $64.0 million are earnings of the spun off Technologies business, including allocated interest expense of $30.9 million. Also included are a $80.0 million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued Defense Systems business and a charge of $1.7 million for interest charges on postretirement benefit obligations. Net income (loss). We recorded a net loss of $337.7 million for 2001 compared to net income of $110.6 million in 2000. This variance reflects the effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Additional information regarding discontinued operations and the related accounting policies can be found in Notes 1, 3 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Segment Results 2001 Compared to 2000 (See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for detailed segment results.) Segment operating profit is presented before taxes, asset impairments and restructuring and other charges. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level is discussed below and in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Agricultural Products Agricultural Products revenue decreased to $653.1 million in 2001 from $664.7 million in 2000. Agricultural Products segment operating profit declined to $72.8 million, down 17.1 percent from the prior year. The decrease in Agricultural Products revenues was largely due to a lack of sulfentrazone sales to E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") in 2001. In 1998 we entered into an exclusive agreement with DuPont to provide them sulfentrazone in North America for use on soybeans. However, the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001. DuPont no longer has exclusive rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in North America. We began developing new markets in 2001, expanding our sulfentrazone sales, including sales into the soybean market in North America. We believe that we have recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the absence of DuPonts purchases. Somewhat offsetting the sulfentrazone sales decline in North America was an increase in carfentrazone sales into the rice and cotton defoliation markets as a result of new product registrations. We believe that sulfentrazone sales will increase slightly in 2002; however, we will idle our production facility early in 2002 to allow product inventories to align with expected sales volumes. 14 Agricultural Products sales were also affected by weakened Asian markets due to depressed crop prices, unfavorable climatic conditions and lower pricing in some Asian markets due to weaker exchange rates. Asian revenue shortfalls were offset by stronger demand for herbicides in Latin and South America due mainly to the introduction of several new herbicide registrations in 2001. Agricultural Products operating profit declined to $72.8 million from $87.8 million as a result of a decline in operating margins to 11.1 percent in 2001 from 13.2 percent in 2000. This lower profitability reflects reduced volumes of sulfentrazone, weaker pricing due to lower crop prices, and weaker currencies in Asia and Brazil. The adverse impact of the lower sulfentrazone volumes in North America was significantly offset by a one time contract penalty payment from DuPont of $20.0 million which was paid in the first half of 2001. Additionally, Agricultural Products incurred higher selling costs in North America in 2001 as it pursued new sulfentrazone markets through direct selling instead of through DuPonts sales channels. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Agricultural Products began a restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products. We will concentrate our future research and development ("R&D") activities on our core strength of insecticides and reduce all work on herbicides, while continuing our efforts to maximize the market potential of already commercialized herbicide chemistries including clomazone, carfentrazone and sulfentrazone. Additionally, we have reduced our direct sales and support staffs outside North, South and Latin America, relying instead on new and expanded strategic alliances with Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd ("ISK") in Asia and Belchim in Europe. A restructuring charge of $12.5 million ($7.8 million after tax) was taken in the fourth quarter to implement these plans. This restructuring should be complete by the end of the first quarter 2002. We believe that Agricultural Products will have a challenging year in 2002, but the actions we have taken to expand product labels, improve market access and reduce costs should allow us to recover the earnings decline that resulted from the loss of DuPonts sulfentrazone business. Specialty Chemicals Specialty Chemicals revenue was $472.0 million in 2001, down from $488.8 million in 2000 due to lower revenue in both the FMC BioPolymer AS ("BioPolymer") and Lithium businesses. Specialty Chemicals segment operating profit declined to $87.5 million, or 5.3 percent from $92.4 million in the prior year. BioPolymer revenue decreases resulted from a combination of weaker demand and lower selling prices for alginate and carrageenan in specialty markets, partially offset by strong growth from microcrystalline cellulose in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets. Specialty markets, which include pet food, textiles and household products, experienced the impacts of a slowing economy and lower competitor pricing. Customer inventory corrections and a weak euro also drove sales lower. Lithium revenue decreases resulted from our strategic exit from the commodity lithium carbonate market and slower industrial markets, particularly in Europe. The lithium carbonate market has experienced substantially lower prices since the entry of a new competitor in 1997 which resulted in our decision to exit the market. These sales declines were offset by continued growth in lithium specialty products. Specialty Chemicals operating profit decreased to $87.5 million in 2001 from $92.4 million in 2000 despite relatively flat operating margins as compared to 2000. The decrease in operating profit can be attributed to a decrease in BioPolymer volumes and prices in the pet food, textile and household products markets offset, in part, by lower operating costs and an improved mix in lithium. A weaker euro, compared to the prior year, also unfavorably impacted earnings. 15 Industrial Chemicals Industrial Chemicals revenue decreased to $822.0 million in 2001, compared to $905.6 million in 2000. Industrial Chemical segment operating profit declined by 36.6 percent to $72.6 million in 2001 from $114.5 million in 2000. Revenue decreases reflected weaker demand in most markets for Industrial Chemicals. Weaker end market demand for glass and the entry of a new competitor resulted in lower soda ash volumes and revenue compared to the prior year. Price increases announced in the late summer of 2001 are not expected to have any material effect on revenues until 2002. In hydrogen peroxide, weakness in the pulp and textile markets resulted in decreased revenues despite the price increases initiated in late 2000 and the application of an energy surcharge in early 2001. Softer demand in the polymer and electronics end markets also resulted in lower volumes for specialty peroxygens. Foret, our Spain based operation, recorded increases in sales that reflected strong phosphate and zeolite markets. Phosphate volumes improved as a result of a recovery in their export markets, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. Zeolite sales increased as a result of an acquisition in the third quarter of 2001 and stronger sales to new and existing customers. Conversely, peroxygen sales declined on lower export sales. Forets increase in sales was offset by unfavorable translation, due to a weaker euro in 2001. These revenue comparisons were further affected by the inclusion of the sales of our U.S. based phosphorus business in the first three months of 2000. Subsequent U.S. phosphorus sales have been deconsolidated and recorded in earnings from equity investments as part of Astaris, which was formed effective April 1, 2000 (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). We account for Astaris on an equity basis for Industrial Chemicals and therefore, the sales of Astaris are not reflected in our consolidated revenues after March 2000. Industrial Chemicals operating profit (net of minority interests) decreased 36.6 percent to $72.6 million in 2001 from $114.5 million in 2000. Driving the Industrial Chemicals segments profit decreases were lower sales volumes in hydrogen peroxide, soda ash and active oxidants and reduced earnings from Astaris, as discussed below. Additionally, during 2000 we hedged our natural gas requirements for 2001, which, due to the forward pricing in the market at that time, resulted in generally higher gas costs in 2001 versus the prior year. Offsetting these unfavorable factors were increased pricing in several products. Our U.S. based phosphorus business is comprised of our 50 percent interest in Astaris for the manufacture and sale of our phosphorus based products, and the activities of our corporate phosphorus division, which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the Astaris elemental phosphorus plant in Pocatello, Idaho. Astaris has experienced a difficult business environment as a result of the economic slowdown and significant changes in its manufacturing and sourcing strategy. During the first quarter of 2001, Astaris was asked by its electric power provider, Idaho Power Company, to assist in combating the energy crisis in the state of Idaho. Historically, the Astaris elemental phosphorus facility has been the largest consumer of power in the state. Astaris agreed to work with Idaho Power and signed a two year agreement to resell 50 megawatts of power to Idaho Power at rates below the then current market prices, but above the rate paid by Astaris under its power contract. The gross economic value of the power contract, in the nine months of 2001 during which the contract was in effect, was $68.0 million of which half, or $34.0 million, is reflected in FMCs earnings in Astaris. However, this decision required Astaris to shutdown one of the two remaining operating furnaces in Pocatello and to source raw materials including purified phosphoric acid and other products from third party suppliers at an additional cost to Astaris of approximately $60.0 million ($30.0 million is reflected in FMCs earnings in Astaris). This significant restructuring of the supply chain also adversely impacted Astaris sales. Sales declined due to the intentional reduction of volume capacity and Astaris inability to meet customer material needs. In December 2001, the Idaho Public Utility Commission ("IPUC") was petitioned by its staff to reduce the future amounts to be paid to Astaris under the power resale contract. This petition is subject to the approval of the full IPUC, which is expected to make a decision later in 2002. Any adverse decision would be subject to appeal. 16 Additionally, the start up of the new Astaris PPA plant in Soda Springs, Idaho in the second half of the year added costs in 2001. Start up costs for this plant are expected to continue until early 2002. Our corporate phosphorus division also affected segment operating profit in 2001. Working with the EPA and the Shoshone Bannock Tribes we agreed to amend the July 1999 Consent Decree to permit the capping of a specific waste disposal pond at the Pocatello site. As part of this settlement, FMC agreed to contribute $40.0 million to a fund for the Tribes to support various Tribal activities. ($30.0 million was paid during 2001). This agreement enabled Astaris to shutdown the Pocatello operation in December 2001. We expect the results of our U.S. based phosphorus operations to improve in 2002. The new Astaris PPA plant in Idaho should be fully operational in early 2002 and start up expenses experienced in 2001 should be significantly less in 2002. In addition, spending by the corporate phosphorus division will be lower in 2002 compared with 2001 due to lower spending on projects under the Consent Decree. We believe the shutdown of the elemental phosphorus production at Pocatello will enable Astaris to lower its costs by increasing the share of the supplies it obtains from lower cost purified phosphoric acid. Following this challenging year, we believe that results in the Industrial Chemicals segment will improve in 2002. We will continue to focus on lowering the cost of production and we expect to benefit from the 2001 restructuring of our U.S. phosphorus business. However, market demand is expected to continue to be weak through most of 2002 partially offsetting the improvements in our U.S. phosphorus business. Results of Operations 2000 Compared to 1999 Revenue was $2,050.3 million in 2000, down from $2,320.5 million in 1999. Revenue in the United States decreased 17.3 percent compared with 1999, while revenue outside the United States, including exports, decreased by less than 5.9 percent when compared to 1999. Sales in the United States represented 47.1 percent of our 2000 revenue compared to 50.3 percent in 1999. Revenue. Lower revenue in 2000 when compared with 1999 was principally attributable to the contribution of our phosphorus operations to a joint venture and to divestitures of other businesses, and was offset by revenue from a Specialty Chemicals business acquired in 1999. Beginning April 1, 2000, sales of phosphorus chemicals were recorded by Astaris and are not reflected as revenue in our consolidated financial statements. Our interest in Astaris is accounted for under the equity method and our share of Astaris operating earnings is included in operating profit for our Industrial Chemicals segment. (See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.) Income from continuing operations, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income taxes excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges (in 2000 and 1999) and gains on divestitures of businesses (in 1999) was $153.5 million in 2000 compared with $132.0 million in 1999. This increase reflects the performance of our business segments discussed more fully below and in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Gains on divestitures of businesses. On July 9, 1999, we completed the sale of our bioproducts business to Cambrex Corporation for $38.2 million in cash, resulting in a pre tax gain of $20.1 million. Our bioproducts business was included in our Specialty Chemicals segment and had 1999 revenue of $13.3 million (through the date of divestiture). On July 31, 1999, we completed the sale of our process additives business to Great Lakes Chemical Corporation for $161.1 million in cash, resulting in a gain of $35.4 million on both a pre tax and after tax basis. Our process additives business was included in our Specialty Chemicals segment and had 1999 revenue of $98.5 million (through the date of divestiture). 17 Asset impairments recorded by the company amounted to $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax) and $23.1 million ($14.1 million after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the second quarter of 2000, we recorded asset impairments of $10.1 million. Impairments of $9.0 million were recognized as a result of the formation of Astaris (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), including the writedown of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to the planned closure of two phosphorus facilities. Other impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the Specialty Chemicals segment. In the third quarter of 1999, we recorded asset impairments of $23.1 million. Asset impairments of $14.7 million were required to write off the remaining net book values of two U.S. lithium facilities. Both facilities were constructed to run pilot and development quantities for new lithium based products. During the third quarter of 1999, management determined that it would not be feasible to use the facilities as configured. Additionally, an impairment charge of $8.4 million was required to write off the remaining net book value of a caustic soda facility in Green River, Wyoming. Estimated future cash flows related to this facility indicated that an impairment of the full value had occurred. Restructuring and other charges. Total restructuring and other charges of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax) were recorded in 2000 compared to $11.1 million ($6.8 million after tax) in 1999. Restructuring charges of $20.6 million were attributable to the Astaris formation and the concurrent reorganization of our Industrial Chemicals sales, marketing and support organizations, the reduction of office space requirements in our Philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company. In addition, we recorded environmental accruals of $12.5 million because of increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties. Other restructuring charges included $2.1 million for several smaller projects. In the third quarter of 1999, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $11.1 million ($6.8 million after tax). Restructuring and other charges of $9.2 million resulted primarily from strategic decisions to divest or restructure a number of businesses and support departments, including certain Agricultural Products and corporate and shared service support departments. The remaining charge related to actions, including headcount reductions, required to achieve planned synergies from acquisitions of businesses in Specialty Chemicals. Income (loss) from continuing operations of $125.6 million in 2000 was lower when compared with $158.7 million in 1999, primarily resulting from gains on divestitures of businesses in 1999 and higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2000. Corporate expenses (excluding restructuring and other charges in 2000 and 1999) of $36.2 million in 2000 reflected a decrease of $5.1 million from 1999. The companys cost reduction efforts are responsible for this trend. Net interest expense was $61.8 million and $76.4 million during 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in 2000 was the result of lower average debt levels when compared with 1999. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension and postretirement plan adjustments. Other income of $9.6 million remained relatively flat when compared to $9.3 million recorded in 1999. Discontinued operations. During 2000, we recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $17.7 million ($15.0 million after tax). Of this amount, $64.0 million represents the earnings of the spun off Technologies business including interest expense of $30.9 million allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with APB 30 and later relevant accounting guidance. Also included is a $80.0 million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued Defense Systems business and a charge of $1.7 million for interest charges on postretirement benefit obligations. 18 We recorded net income from discontinued operations of $73.5 million ($53.9 million after tax) in 1999. Of this amount, $79.2 million related to the earnings of the spun off Technologies businesses including allocated interest expense of $30.3 million. Results of discontinued operations in 1999 included gains of $53.7 million from the sale of properties in California that were formerly used by our divested defense business (as discussed below). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 1999, we provided $59.4 million in response to updated estimates of environmental remediation costs, primarily at our former Defense Systems sites, and increased estimates of our liabilities for general liability, workers compensation, postretirement benefit obligations, legal defense, property maintenance and other costs. During the year ended December 31, 1999, we sold several real estate properties formerly used by United Defense, L.P., and our Defense Systems operations divested by our company in 1997. In the second quarter of 1999, we received $33.5 million in cash, recognizing a gain of $29.5 million, and in the fourth quarter of 1999, we received $31.0 million in cash, recognizing a gain of $24.2 million related to property sales. Net income in 2000 was $110.6 million compared to $212.6 million in 1999. Contributing to this decrease was a one time gain of $55.5 million related to the divestiture of a Specialty Chemicals business in 1999 offset by a charge of $66.7 million to discontinued operations in 2000 related to our former Defense Systems business segment. Segment Results 2000 Compared to 1999 Agricultural Products Agricultural Products revenue increased to $664.7 million in 2000 compared to $632.4 million in 1999. Operating profits increased to $87.8 million in 2000 compared to $64.3 million in 1999. Agricultural Products revenue increased because of stronger sales in Latin and North America, which more than offset lower sales in Asia. North American revenue improved after a return to more normal pest pressures following 1999s unusually low levels. Latin American sales improved due to a rapid recovery from the devaluation of the Brazilian real in 1999, a new distribution agreement for third party products in Brazil and a stronger Mexican market. Increased revenue in 2000 also reflected higher volumes for herbicides and pyrethroids, offset by lower sales of carbamates. Operating profits in our Agricultural Products segment increased to $87.8 million in 2000 from $64.3 million in 1999 on increased volumes and lower costs, partially offset by higher research and development spending to develop a new herbicide and to fund our strategic alliance with Devgen, a Belgian biotechnology company, to support the companys insecticide discovery program. Specialty Chemicals Specialty Chemicals revenue was $488.8 million in 2000, down from $564.5 million in 1999. Operating profit was $92.4 million compared to $73.5 million. Lower revenue in 2000 reflected our divestitures of the process additives and bioproducts businesses, both of which occurred in the third quarter of 1999, and the effect of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Partially offsetting this decrease in 2000 was revenue from Pronova Biopolymer AS, an alginate business acquired in mid 1999. The Pronova Biopolymer operation was combined with certain carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose businesses and renamed FMC BioPolymer AS. BioPolymers revenue reflected a strong market for pharmaceutical and food grade microcrystalline cellulose along with growth in sales to Latin America and Asia, but was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation of the euro to the U.S. dollar. 19 Sales of lithium products were up slightly in 2000. Increased revenue reflected higher volumes of butyllithium to the polymer and pharmaceutical markets. Lithium volume increases were offset by lower pricing, primarily the result of weak European currencies. Specialty Chemicals operating profit in 2000 increased to $92.4 million from $73.5 million in 1999. BioPolymers increased profitability was based on lower manufacturing costs in 2000 for carrageenan and realized synergies associated with the acquisition of the alginate product line when compared with 1999. Lithiums improved operating profitability in 2000 when compared with 1999 was a result of higher sales, and the successful implementation of manufacturing cost reduction initiatives. Industrial Chemicals Industrial Chemicals revenue decreased to $905.6 million in 2000 from $1,141.3 million in 1999. Operating profit (net of minority interests) declined to $114.5 million in 2000 from $144.4 million in 1999. Lower revenue was primarily the result of the contribution of the phosphorus business to the newly formed Astaris joint venture, effective April 1, 2000. After that date, phosphorus revenue was no longer consolidated with our revenue. Phosphorus revenue of $327.0 million through December 31, 1999 is included in 1999 segment revenue, while revenue in 2000 before the joint venture formation amounted to $79.2 million. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2000, our equity share of Astaris earnings was included in segment operating profit for Industrial Chemicals. Other factors contributing to reduced revenue were the translation impact of the weaker euro and competitive pressures both at Spain based FMC Foret and at Astaris. Partially offsetting the decline in revenue were increased sales of hydrogen peroxide, reflecting both volume and price increases compared with 1999, and soda ash, a result of the Tg Soda Ash acquisition in mid 1999. Reduced profitability for Industrial Chemicals to $114.5 million in 2000 was primarily the result of increased energy costs for all businesses, but especially at Astaris, while foreign currency translation losses negatively affected reported operating profitability at Foret. In addition, segment profits were down due to phosphorus environmental compliance costs retained by our company for design, implementation and depreciation of capital assets in Pocatello, Idaho in connection with the Consent Decree. Offsetting these declines in profitability were higher earnings for soda ash and hydrogen peroxide. Soda ash profitability increased in 2000, reflecting the Tg Soda Ash acquisition and reduced costs despite significant increases in energy prices. Hydrogen peroxides favorable operating profits were largely the result of a strong pulp and paper market. In addition, our share of Astaris results reflected the cost reduction benefits of the joint ventures rationalization and restructuring programs. Taxes Although our domestic earnings (losses) are generally subject to tax expense (benefit) at the statutory rate of 35.0 percent, many factors alter our consolidated tax rate. These factors include non deductible or non taxable transactions related to goodwill or other items, differing foreign tax rates, state tax increments, depletion, extraterritorial income exclusion, and other permanent differences. Our effective tax rate of 35.2 percent on income from continuing operations in 2001 also includes the beneficial impact of deductible restructuring and impairment charges recorded during the year. (See Notes 6, 7 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements.) New Accounting Standards Adopted On January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain 20 Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," an amendment of SFAS No. 133. These Statements establish accounting and reporting standards that require every derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires the transition adjustment resulting from adopting these Statements to be reported in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, as appropriate, as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. On January 1, 2001, we recorded the fair value of all outstanding derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The transition adjustment was a $0.9 million after tax loss to earnings and a $16.4 million after tax gain to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Both components of the adjustment were recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and adds disclosure requirements related to business combination transactions. SFAS No. 141 also establishes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill. This Statement applies to all business combinations for which the acquisition date was July 1, 2001 or later. We had no significant acquisitions during 2001. We intend to implement the provisions of SFAS No. 141 in any of our future business combinations. On June 30, 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which establishes guidelines for the financial accounting and reporting of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization; rather, it will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We are required to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement no later than the beginning of 2002, however, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, are subject immediately to the amortization provisions of this statement. We had no material acquisitions of goodwill or other intangibles in the second half of 2001. We will adopt the amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 beginning in the first quarter of 2002. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, goodwill and other intangible amortization (pretax and after discontinued operations) was $19.4 million, $13.5 million and $12.0 million, respectively. We believe adopting SFAS No. 142 will result in approximately a $4.0 million pre tax benefit to earnings in 2002. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We are required to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement no later than the beginning of 2003 and are evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 143. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." The Statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes APB No. 30 provisions related to the accounting and reporting for the disposal of a segment of a business. This Statement establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The Statement retains most of the requirements in SFAS No. 121 related to the recognition of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used. The Statement is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2001. We are evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 144. Environmental Obligations Our company, like other industrial manufacturers, is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. We believe strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, public health and employee safety. This responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes. 21 When issues arise, including notices from the Environmental Protection Agency or other government agencies identifying our company as a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP"), our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues. When necessary, we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental, legal, financial and communications personnel to ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health, as well as to our employees and shareholders. Environmental provisions totaling $68.8 million ($42.0 million after tax) were recorded this year. These provisions largely related to the remediation of the Pocatello site as discussed in Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements. Also included were costs related to continued cleanup of certain discontinued manufacturing operations from previous years. This provision and those made in 2000 and 1999, and our accounting policies on environmental remediation, are more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of 2000, we provided environmental reserves totaling $12.5 million related to ongoing remediation of several phosphorus manufacturing properties as part of the restructuring and other charges described previously. Additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in Notes 1 and 13, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements. Information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates of 2002 environmental spending are included in the section below entitled "Cash Flow Analysis." Liquidity and Capital Resources In 2001, we experienced the net cash impact of significant special items recorded in the year and spending related to the spin off of Technologies. This spending was somewhat offset by the cash proceeds received in the IPO of Technologies. Cash from operations, supplemented with proceeds from the IPO and a new credit facility, provided funding for our capital spending program, debt pay down and interest payments throughout 2001. Capital expenditures totaling $145.6 million in 2001, which included $41.2 million of required Pocatello Consent Decree spending, were down 26.2 percent from 2000. We believe capital expenditures will be reduced in 2002, largely because of the absence of this Consent Decree spending. Principal categories of capital spending in 2002 include replacement of existing plant equipment and compliance spending related to environmental and safety standards. We retired $128.3 million of long term debt in 2001, in part with a portion of the proceeds from the IPO of Technologies. Cash paid for interest in 2001 was $79.1 million compared with $101.6 million in 2000. This decrease can be attributed to lower average debt levels in 2001 compared to 2000. Future cash needs include the scheduled repayment of several significant financings over the next two years, operating cash requirements and capital expenditures. We plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from operations, commercial paper borrowings, accounts receivable securiti zation, borrowings under bank credit facilities, and if necessary, the issuance of additional long term debt. We maintain a universal shelf registration under which, at December 31, 2001, $345.0 million of securities could be issued. We currently maintain a commercial paper financing program with outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2001 of $33.0 million compared to $16.8 million at December 31, 2000. 22 Our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows: Expected Cash Payments by Year 2006 & Contractual Commitments 2002 2003 2004 2005 beyond Total (In Millions) Short term debt.............................. $136.5 $ $ $ $ $ 136.5 Long term debt............................... 135.2 182.2 0.5 89.5 379.6 787.0 Lease obligations............................ 25.8 24.9 23.3 22.7 103.2 199.9 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 16.2 6.2 2.4 1.1 25.9 Guarantees of vendor financing............... 56.0 56.0 Total........................................ $369.7 $ 213.3 $26.2 $113.3 $482.8 $1,205.3 Our five year, non amortizing committed revolving credit agreement expired in December 2001. There were no outstanding balances under this agreement at the due date. At the same time we entered into a new $240.0 million committed revolving credit facility to meet certain operating cash needs, capital expenditures, and commercial paper demands. This credit facility will expire in December 2002. The total amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2001 was $68.0 million, which was used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. The credit agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings), interest coverage (measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings) and consolidated net worth. We were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2001. We expect to renew or replace this credit facility prior to its expiration. In January 2002, we arranged a supplemental $50.0 million committed credit facility to meet short term seasonal financing needs. This credit facility expires on August 31, 2002. We also obtain financing through an accounts receivable securitization. We sell receivables, without recourse, through our wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary, FMC Funding Corporation, which then sells the receivables to an unrelated finance company. The sold receivables and repurchase obligations related to the financing are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, because we have limited risk to repurchase the receivables. The financing from the securitization totaled $79.0 million at December 31, 2001 compared to $113.0 million on December 31, 2000. The agreement for the sale of accounts receivable provides for the continuation of the program on a revolving basis through November 2002. We expect to renew or replace this financing prior to its expiration. At December 31, 2001, long term debt included $28.8 million of 6.75 percent Exchangeable Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2005. (See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.) These debentures are callable by FMC at par plus accrued interest upon at least 30 days prior notice. These debentures are exchangeable by the holders at any time into the common stock of Meridian Gold, Inc. (NYSE: MDG), the successor to a former subsidiary of FMC, at an exchange price of $15.125 per share, subject to adjustment. FMC may elect to pay the holders in cash an amount equivalent to the value of the Meridian Gold common stock into which the holders could exchange their debentures. At December 31, 2001, FMC did not hold any shares of Meridian Gold common stock. On February 19, 2002, the closing price of Meridian Gold common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $13.16. If the price goes above $15.125, it is reasonably likely that during 2002 the holders would exercise their exchange rights. Long term debt also includes $44.3 million of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds that are supported by bank letters of credit. The letters of credit generally have a term of thirteen months and extend each month for an additional month unless and until the bank sends us a letter of non renewal. At December 31, 2001, no notice of non renewal had been received. 23 The current rating of our commercial paper and similar short term indebtedness is A 3 by Standard & Poors Ratings Group ("S&P") and P 3 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys"). The market for commercial paper with this rating is limited. The current rating of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness is BBB by S&P and Baa3 by Moodys. A downgrade in our credit ratings, which may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time, could increase the cost and restrict the availability of future financings. The following table displays credit facilities, debt obligations and other items along with the cash payments that could be required to repay them, if required following a downgrade or series of downgrades in our credit rating: Potential Cash Facility Payments (In Millions) Commercial paper..................... $33.0 Accounts receivable securitization(1) $79.0 Forward energy contracts............. $13.3 (1) Program terminates upon a reduction in rating to Ba2 by Moodys or BB by S&P or below Our future liquidity could be affected by certain letters of credit, commitments and guarantees we provide to vendors, customers and others for which we are contingently liable. In connection with the spin off of Technologies, we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling $289.0 million at December 31, 2001. Contingent obligations include guarantees of the performance of Technologies under various customer contracts, reimbursements on behalf of Technologies under letters of credit and surety bonds, and guarantees of indebtedness of Technologies. We have a guarantee from Technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to satisfy these obligations. Technologies has obtained contractual releases of FMC reducing the level of liabilities for which we are contingently liable to $175.0 million at February 12, 2002. Because our expectation that the underlying obligations will be met and the existence of the guarantee from Technologies, we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these contingent obligations and expect this contingent liability to continue to be reduced throughout 2002. The majority of these obligations will expire before the end of 2003. We have provided an agreement to lenders of Astaris under which we have agreed to make equity contributions to Astaris sufficient to make up one half of any short fall in Astaris earnings below certain levels. Astaris earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2001 and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2002. We contributed $31.3 million to Astaris under this arrangement in 2001 and expect to contribute a similar amount in 2002. The proportional amount of Astaris indebtedness subject to this agreement from FMC at December 31, 2001 was $111.9 million. Our estimates of future contributions are based on Astaris forecasts and are subject to some uncertainty. We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers for their seasonal borrowing. The customers obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops. The total of these guarantees at December 31, 2001 was $56.0 million. (See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.) On June 30, 1999, FMC acquired the assets of Tg Soda Ash, Inc. ("TgSA") from Elf Atochem North America, Inc. for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end 2003. The contingent payment amount, which will be based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003, cannot currently be determined but could be as much as $75.0 million. Our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by general economic conditions and by financial, competitive, political, business and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We believe that the cash generated from our businesses coupled with our ability to obtain financing will be sufficient to enable us 24 to make our debt payments as they become due. We also actively evaluate opportunities to refinance our existing obligations when financing is available on attractive terms. If, however, we do not generate sufficient cash or complete such financings on a timely basis, we may be required to seek additional financing or sell equity on terms which may not be as favorable as we could have otherwise obtained. No assurance can be given that any refinancing, additional borrowing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets, as well as our own financial condition. Cash Flow Analysis Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 were $23.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively. We had total borrowings of $923.5 million and $1,007.5 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating working capital, which includes trade receivables (net), inventories, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued payroll, other current liabilities and the current portion of accrued pension and other postretirement benefits, increased $67.0 million to $24.8 million at December 31, 2001, from an unfavorable $42.2 million at December 31, 2000. Factors contributing to the increase in operating working capital at year end 2001 when compared with 2000 include increased accounts receivable and inventory amounts. Cash required by operating activities of $90.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased from $298.3 million of cash provided by operations in 2000 primarily as a result of increased restructuring spending accompanied by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances. Also contributing to the variance was a decrease in our accounts receivable financing balance in 2001 compared to the prior year. Cash required by investing activities of $154.9 million in 2001 increased from the 2000 requirement of $97.4 million, reflecting the impact of a prior year distribution from Astaris, which was not repeated in the current year. Capital spending (excluding acquisitions) of $145.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased when compared with 2000. Lower spending on significant capital projects was due to lower Consent Decree spending at Pocatello. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 of $376.5 million was higher than the 2000 requirement of $162.0 million, primarily due to the contribution related to the distribution of Technologies assets and an increase in long term debt offset by long term debt paydowns of $128.3 million. Projected 2002 spending also includes approximately $10.3 million for environmental compliance at current operating sites, which is an operating expense of the company, plus approximately $35.5 million of remediation spending and $11.2 million for environmental study costs at current operating, previously operated and other sites, which have been accrued in prior periods. Dividends On November 29, 2001, our Board of Directors approved the spin off of the remaining 83 percent of Technologies making it an independent publicly traded company. The spin off qualified as a tax free distribution to U.S. stockholders. Stockholders of record as of December 31, 2001 received approximately 1.72 shares of common stock of the new company for every 1.0 share of our stock. Fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on December 31, 2001. No cash dividends were paid in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above. No cash dividends were paid in 2000. No cash dividends are expected to be paid in 2002. 25 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary financial market risks include changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity pricing. In managing our exposure to these risks, we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures. We account for these derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133 (see "New Accounting Standards Adopted" and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements). We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2001, our derivative holdings consisted primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and natural gas forward contracts. When we or one of our subsidiaries sells or purchases products or services outside the United States, transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated, when possible, with natural hedges, whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another. A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations among the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which could be material. Due to the weakness of the euro in the period from 1999 through 2001, our business results have been adversely affected by unfavorable U.S. dollar translation of earnings of our operations in Europe. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure such as entering into forwards and swaps, where available, but we cannot ensure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, we initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward or option contracts with third parties when natural hedges do not exist. The maturity dates of the currency exchange agreements that provide hedge coverage are consistent with those of the underlying purchase or sales commitments. To monitor our currency exchange rate risks, we use a sensitivity analysis, which measures the impact on earnings of an immediate 10 percent devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure. Based on a sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2001, fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results, financial position or cash flows. We believe that our hedging activities have been effective in reducing our risks related to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are exposed to changes in interest rates because of our financing and cash management activities, which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund our business operations. In managing interest rate risk, our strategic policy is to monitor the ratio of our fixed to floating rate debt. We may, from time to time, use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We did not enter into any material interest rate swaps in 2001 or 2000. To address our exposure to risks from changes in commodity prices, we enter into forward or swap contracts relating to energy purchases used in our manufacturing processes. The forward energy contracts qualifying as hedges are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The gains or losses on these contracts are included as an adjustment to the cost of sales or services when the contracts are settled. For more information on derivative financial instruments and related accounting policies, see Notes 1 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. 26
