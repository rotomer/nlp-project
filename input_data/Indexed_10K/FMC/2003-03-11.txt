ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Company We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our biopolymers and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. Agricultural Products Our Agricultural Products segment manufactures and sells proprietary, branded insecticides and herbicides. We have a strong position in two widely used classes of insecticides, pyrethroids and carbamates, and possess a niche portfolio of proprietary herbicides. These products are used for the protection of cotton, corn, rice, cereals, vegetables and other crops. In addition in North America we sell into the professional pest control and home and garden markets. We differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions, and by leveraging proprietary chemistries and pest specific research and development (R&D) to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products. We have also developed strategic alliances with companies such as Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. (ISK), a Japanese crop protection company, to access new markets and develop new insecticides. Specialty Chemicals Our Specialty Chemicals segment is comprised of our biopolymers and lithium businesses. BioPolymer manufactures and sells microcrystalline cellulose, carrageenan and alginates, products that add texture, structure and physical stability to a wide range of beverage, dairy, meat and bakery products and or that act as binders and disintegrants for tablets and capsules. Our lithium business is a technology based business in which mined lithium is processed and sold for use in a broad array of specialty products, including pharmaceuticals, specialty polymers and energy storage devices. The majority of Specialty Chemicals sales are to customers engaged in non cyclical end markets, such as food and pharmaceuticals. Industrial Chemicals Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. Through our manufacturing facility in Green River, Wyoming, we process naturally occurring soda ash, a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass. We produce hydrogen peroxide, leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout North America to reach our customers. We also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics, polymers and food processing industries. Our European subsidiary, FMC Foret, S.A. (Foret), leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals, peroxygens, sulfur derivatives, silicates, zeolites and other products in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We are also a 50 percent owner with Solutia, Inc. (Solutia) of Astaris LLC (Astaris), a North American producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets, including the detergent, food, agricultural and industrial markets. We account for Astaris as an equity investment. The majority of Industrial Chemicals sales are to customers engaged in relatively non cyclical end markets. The Reorganization of Our Company We implemented our plan to split FMC into separate chemical and machinery companies in 2001 through a two step process. The first step included an initial public offering (IPO) of 17 percent of FMC Technologies, 25 Inc. (Technologies), which took place in the second quarter of 2001. Technologies consists of our former Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems business segments. Subsequent to the IPO, Technologies made net payments of $430.7 million to FMC in exchange for the net assets distributed to Technologies on June 1, 2001, which we used to retire short term and long term debt. The second step, the distribution of our remaining 83 percent ownership in Technologies (the spin off) occurred on December 31, 2001. Total net assets distributed on December 31, 2001 were $509.5 million. We believe that the spin off of Technologies has allowed us to focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation, increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses. In an effort to align our business with our future growth plans, we took various strategic measures in 2002, 2001 and 2000, including the restructuring of businesses, reduction of staff, plant shut downs, plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets. We believe these steps will increase our financial flexibility as operating conditions change. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those which we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. Critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental We provide for environmental related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (ROD), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) that is accepted by FMC and the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by our financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and or study of sites at which our company is alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. 26 In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of its environmental reserves, the company has taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and has considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site by site basis. Our liability includes managements best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before its consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. We have recorded recoveries in Environmental reserves, continuing and discontinued, representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies, U.S. government agencies and other third parties, of $27.7 million and $41.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and 2001. These recoveries are recorded as an offset to the Environmental reserve, continuing and discontinued. Cash recoveries for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $16.2 million, $12.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to receive payments for recoveries in the future. Our total environmental reserves, before recoveries, totaled $223.4 million and $260.4 million at December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2002 we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $80 million. Impairments and valuation of long lived assets Our long lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We review the carrying value of these assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. The standard requires that we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets. The fair value of long lived assets is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We recognized $323.1 million and $10.1 million in asset impairments in 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments. We also prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is based on estimated discounted cash flows. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include managements best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Total goodwill as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $129.7 million and $113.5 million, respectively. Depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset. Estimated useful lives are based on historical useful life trends as well as common industry practice. Useful lives are as follows: 20 years land improvements, 20 to 50 years buildings (depending on location and use), 3 to 18 years machinery and equipment (depending on type and use). Depreciation expense totaled $105.2 million, $112.2 million and $116.3 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Pension and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (or benefits) and 27 obligations related to these benefits reflect our key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, including things such as the average retirement age, mortality tables, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods permitted under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, (SFAS 87) both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. The unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may affect periodic benefit costs in future periods, however, we do not expect this to have a significant impact in 2003. We recorded $4.9 million and $4.0 million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and a $5.1 million credit in pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2000. We expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase in 2003, due to a combination of factors, including changes in key assumptions such as the discount rate and an increase in the amortization of prior service cost. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $106.6 million and $116.7 million, respectively, was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of $84.8 million and $8.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which were recorded as other comprehensive losses in stockholders equity. The companys operating cash flows for 2002 included a $2.8 million voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. qualified pension plan. Although we are not required to make any cash contributions to this plan in 2003, we are considering making voluntary cash contributions of approximately $5 million. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of high quality corporate bonds (with particular focus on the Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) Aa rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices) at the end of each respective year. Bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least 20 years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately 30 years. We selected a discount rate of 6.5 percent at December 31, 2002 for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As described within SFAS 87, the expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a long term, average rate of return to be earned on the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In developing the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis (using a geometric average) performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plans trust, which has averaged 12.3 percent over the last 10 years (in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities (U.S. and non U.S.) and 30 percent fixed income investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio, using a geometric average, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent, are between nine and eleven percent for both U.S. and non U.S. equities, and between five and seven percent for fixed income 28 investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return in excess of 9.25 percent. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $47.6 million at December 31, 2002 and $43.7 million at December 31, 2001, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $1.2 million, $1.2 million and $2.6 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. A one half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $50.5 million at December 31, 2002 and $46.4 million at December 31, 2001, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit by $1.0 million, $1.1 million and $2.7 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. A one half percent increase in the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $4.0 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. A one half percent decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on assets would have increased pension costs by $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $4.0 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered future taxable income and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the valuation allowance was $22.4 million and $18.0 million, respectively. Results of Operations 2002, 2001 and 2000 Overview Our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1,852.9 million, $1,943.0 million and $2,050.3 million, respectively. In 2002, our first full year as an independent pure play chemical company, we earned net income of $65.8 million compared to a net loss of $337.7 million in 2001 and net income of $110.6 million in 2000. Diluted earnings per common share for the year was $1.92 compared to a diluted loss per common share of $10.86 in 2001 and diluted earnings per common share of $3.50 in 2000. Net income for 2002 included restructuring and other charges and a discontinued operations loss totaling $21.7 million after tax or $0.63 per common share on a diluted basis. In 2001 net income included restructuring and other charges, asset impairments and a discontinued operations loss totaling $436.1 after tax or $13.96 per common share on a diluted basis. In 2000 net income included restructuring and other charges, asset impairments and a discontinued operations loss totaling $42.9 million after tax or $1.36 per common share on a diluted basis. See Results of Operations and Segment Results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2002, 2001 and 2000. All results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses. The results of Technologies, which was spun off on December 31, 2001, have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and consolidated statement of cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. (See The Reorganization of Our Company for an overview of our spin off of Technologies.) 29 Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ending December 31, 2002 and prior year refers to the year ending December 31, 2001. All comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1,852.9 million compared to $1,943.0 million in 2001, down 5 percent. Lower revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally attributable to lower revenue in our Industrial Chemicals and Agricultural Products segments. Our Industrial Chemicals segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions. Also affecting revenue were decreased Agricultural Products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in Asia. In 2003, we expect increased revenue from our Specialty Chemicals and Agricultural Products segments as well as improved domestic markets served by Industrial Chemicals. Asset impairments. There were no asset impairments in 2002. Asset impairments totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) in 2001. Based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets, we recorded asset impairment charges in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments in 2001. Industrial Chemicals recorded impairment charges of $224.2 million of which $12.3 million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while $211.9 million was for the impairments in our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business. A weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of 2001. We subsequently exited this business in 2002. Our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our 50 percent interest in Astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus division, which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former Astaris elemental phosphorus plant in Pocatello, Idaho. Based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets, we recorded asset impairment charges of $211.9 million related to our U.S. based phosphorus business in the second quarter of 2001. The components of asset impairments related to this business include a $171.0 million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Consent Decree (the Consent Decree) at the Pocatello, Idaho facility, a further $4.4 million of other non environmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a $36.5 million impairment charge for our investment in Astaris. Driving these charges were a decline in market conditions, the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second purified phosphoric acid (PPA) plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the Shoshone Bannock Tribes (the Tribal Fund) resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the Consent Decree, which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at Pocatello. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segments lithium operations in Argentina. We established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately six years ago in a remote area of the Andes Mountains. The entry of a South American manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues. In addition, market conditions continued to be unfavorable. As a result, our lithium assets in Argentina became impaired, as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered. Restructuring and other charges totaled $30.1 million ($18.4 million after tax) in 2002 compared to $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) in 2001. In an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business we undertook several key reorganization and cost saving initiatives that resulted in $12.4 million of restructuring charges in 2002. Included in this amount was a $5.7 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in Spring Hill, West Virginia. Of the 16 severances incurred related to the Spring Hill mothballing, the majority will occur in the first half of 2003. We also mothballed our Granger caustic facility, in Green River, Wyoming resulting in a $3.4 million restructuring charge. The majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and 110 severances, all of 30 which occurred in 2002. In addition we recorded a $3.3 million restructuring charge for severance costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our U.S. phosphorus chemicals division, alkali, peroxygens and at Foret. The majority of these charges were for 38 severances, all of which occurred in 2002. We estimate that our Industrial Chemicals restructuring activities will result in approximately $13 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance. In Agricultural Products we incurred $4.7 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which $3.7 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy (See Segment Results 2002 compared to 2001). A $1.0 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in Europe, which will allow us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our European markets. Of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002. We estimate that the restructuring activities will result in approximately $20 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance. We recorded $1.3 million of restructuring charges in our Specialty Chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within BioPolymer, both domestically and internationally. The majority of these costs resulted in the severance of 24 people. These severances are expected to occur in the first half of 2003. We estimated that our Specialty Chemicals restructuring activities will result in approximately $2 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance. Reorganization costs of $3.0 million and other charges of $8.7 million were also recorded in the period. These charges are discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Also, of the $30.1 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 $11.9 million was spent in 2002. We expect the remainder to be spent in 2003. In 2001 a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million, detailed as follows: (In Millions) Gross Recoveries Net(3) U.S. Phosphorus Chemicals Division: Consent Decree obligation $ 68.7 (34.5 )(1) $ 34.2 Financing commitments to Astaris 42.7 Tribal Fund 40.0 Other Phosphorus restructuring 12.0 Pocatello shutdown: Shutdown activities 58.7 (29.6 )(2) 29.1 Remediation 54.3 (6.9 )(2) 47.4 FMCs share of Astaris shutdown obligations 36.3 Total U.S. Phosphorus Chemicals Division 241.7 Workforce related/facility shutdown 21.2 FMCs reorganization 17.5 Total 2001 restructuring and other charges $ 280.4 (1) Partial reversal of Consent Decree obligations. (2) Commitment from Astaris related to shutdown and remediation. (3) See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Industrial Chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million in 2001 of which $6.2 million was for restructuring at several sites, including $5.7 million for the mothballing of our Granger, Wyoming soda ash facility, and $241.7 million was for our U.S. based phosphorus business. There were 130 severances from the restructuring of Industrial Chemicals, the majority of which occurred in 2001, with the remainder occurring in 2002. In connection with the impairment of our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of 2001 we recorded other charges for a $68.7 million reserve for further required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams, $42.7 million for financing obligations to the Astaris joint venture (keepwell payments) and a $40.0 million payment to the Tribal Fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at Pocatello. 31 Subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of 2001, the Astaris joint venture announced its plans, in October 2001, to cease production at the Pocatello, Idaho elemental phosphorus facility in December 2001. This decision reflected the shift in Astariss sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA, and also reflected the availability of low cost alternative feedstock materials, projected higher future environmental compliance costs at Pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the Consent Decree. In connection with the decision to shut down Pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of $76.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. We spent $32.3 million and $0.9 million of these reserves in 2002 and 2001, respectively, with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next 5 to 7 years as we manage the sites decommissioning and environmental issues. These charges included reserves for decontamination, demolition, and other shut down costs of $58.7 million; environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of $54.3 million and our 50 percent share of costs recorded by Astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown, or $36.3 million. Offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of $34.5 million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2001 for required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending. We also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from Astaris to pay us $36.5 million over the next 5 years, reflecting the joint ventures obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site. We received $3.7 million from Astaris in 2002 related to this commitment and expect future payments to be funded from Astariss savings from the shutdown. Also included in the $241.7 million of restructuring and other charges related to the U.S. based phosphorus business was a charge of $12.0 million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of Pocatello. Included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at Pocatello. The decision to shut down Pocatello was consistent with Astariss plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA. High energy, operating and environmental costs of producing elemental phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of PPA. Over time we expected to shift our supply chain to PPA at an annual cost savings of approximately $25 million to Astaris. In addition, Astaris was able to avoid estimated future costs of $9.0 million per year associated with operating the environmental compliance assets related to the Consent Decree. The decision to shut down Pocatello in the fourth quarter of 2001 has allowed us to avoid spending of $34.5 million for the remaining capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any start up costs for this plant, which could have been significant. Further, there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could escalate in future years and add further costs. In addition, estimated future costs at Astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at Pocatello in 2004 at an estimated cost of $10.0 million. In 2001 we recorded $12.5 million of severance and other costs related to our Agricultural Products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our R&D resources to our core strength in insecticides. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002. These charges will result in future savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs. The annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately $20.0 million. There were 163 severances related to these charges, the majority of which occurred in 2002. Of the remaining 2001 restructuring and other charges of $20.0 million, approximately $17.5 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin off of Technologies with remaining charges of $2.5 million related to restructuring in Specialty Chemicals. The majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in 2001 and in the first half of 2002. The benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate reorganization and spin off are not subject to reasonable estimation. The benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company. There were approximately 45 severances related to these charges, the majority occurring in 2001. Net Interest expense in 2002 was $71.6 million compared to $58.3 million in 2001. The increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our 2002 32 refinancing. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statement included in this Form 10 K for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results.) Provision/benefit for income taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million in 2002 compared to a benefit of $166.6 million in 2001 resulting in effective tax rates of 20 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The 2001 tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in 2001. The differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory U.S. Federal income taxes rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates, depletion, the impairment of certain assets, foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes. Discontinued Operations. We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $5.3 million ($3.3 million after tax) in 2002 for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. (See Environmental Obligations below and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statement included in this Form 10 K for further details.) We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million after tax) in 2001. Included in this amount are earnings of Technologies, including interest expense of $11.2 million, which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 30 (APB 30) and later relevant accounting guidance, costs related to the spin off and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of Technologies from FMC. In addition, we recorded a charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses. Net income/loss. We recorded net income of $65.8 million in 2002 compared to a net loss of $337.7 million for 2001. This variance reflects $323.1 million of asset impairments and $280.4 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Net income in 2002 compared to 2001, excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges, was lower due to lower sales in Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals, somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring activities. We expect net income to be lower in 2003 compared to 2002 mostly due to increased interest expense as a result of our recent refinancing and poorer performance from Astaris in a difficult phosphorus market (see Liquidity and Capital Resources.) Other Financial Data Capital Expenditures totaled $83.9 million in 2002 compared to $145.6 million in 2001. Lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential value creating projects. Also reducing capital expenditures was the lack of spending related to environmental assets at Pocatello. The need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of Pocatello. The following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K). Corporate expenses were $35.6 million in 2002 and $36.3 million in 2001. Corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other loss for the year was $0.4 million compared to a net other loss of $1.6 million in 2001. This variance is largely attributable to a LIFO reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses. Segment Results 2002 compared to 2001 Segment operating profit is presented before taxes, asset impairments, restructuring and other charges, interest expense, net and other income and expense, net. Information about how each of these items relates to our 33 businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Agricultural Products Agricultural Products revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $615.1 million, down 6 percent, compared to $653.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Herbicide sales decreased to $135.0 million in 2002 compared to $163.6 million in 2001 mainly due to a planned reduction in sulfentrazone sales, as we shift our focus from soybeans to higher value crops, and poor weather conditions in North America. Insecticide sales were down slightly at $480.1 million in 2002 compared to $489.5 million in 2001 mostly due to weaker insecticide demand in Asia from drought conditions in Australia and channel inventory reductions, somewhat offset by the development of new applications, so called new labels, and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in North America. A stronger demand and new applications in our non agricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in 2002. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $69.5 million compared to $72.8 million in the prior year. Lower herbicide sales and the absence of a $20.0 million profit protection payment from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) were more than offset by lower selling, administrative and research costs. (See Agricultural Products under Segment Results 2001 compared to 2000.) Earnings also reflect Agricultural Products continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and to realign our R&D resources to our core strengths in insecticides. Related to these refocusing efforts were restructuring charges in both 2002 and 2001. In 2002 we recorded $4.7 million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a $12.5 million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops. Restructuring charges are not included in the results of our business segments. See Restructuring and other charges under Results of Operations December 31, 2002 compare to December 31, 2001 for further details. We believe our Agricultural Products segment will continue to show improvement in 2003 through new labels, sales growth from global alliances, continued cost savings and our refocus strategy. Specialty Chemicals Specialty Chemicals revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $488.2 million, up 3 percent from $472.0 million in 2002. BioPolymer revenue increased to $355.2 million from $341.2 million in 2001 reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose, for its use in binders, and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the food ingredients market. Partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients. In lithium, revenue performance was $133.0 million in 2002 compared to $130.8 million in 2001. A stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of lithium salts to Japan, due to a weaker economy, and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred the fourth quarter of 2001. Earnings of $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 were 3 percent higher compared to $87.5 million for 2001. Higher earnings can be attributed to higher sales from overall BioPolymer growth, a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium, due largely to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, and the absence of a $4.2 million ($2.8 million after tax) charge from the required change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill. Specialty Chemicals goodwill was the direct result of BioPolymers 1999 acquisition of Pronova Biopolymer AS. Lithiums earnings were also favorably impacted by higher butyllithium sales. In addition, the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium, discussed above, delivered a high margin sale in 2001 that was not repeated in 2002. 34 During 2002, our BioPolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial markets it serves principally with its alginate product line. As a result, in 2002 we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs. We believe that this action will further focus BioPolymers commercial efforts on core, high value markets, including pharmaceutical formulation, food ingredients and personal care. We will focus our efforts on improving alginates profitability in 2003 by concentrating on higher value markets. Industrial Chemicals Industrial Chemicals revenue was $753.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, down 8 percent, compared to $822.0 million in 2001. Alkali revenue decreased to $368.0 million in 2002 from $402.5 million in 2001 due to lower overall volumes, lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter 2002 sale of our sodium cyanide business. A portion of the decline in soda ash revenues is attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash, which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they did in the first quarter of 2002. Furthermore, we experienced lower international sales volumes through the American Natural Soda Ash Association (ANSAC), a foreign sales association for U.S. soda ash. Foret saw a decrease in revenue to $222.5 million in the current year compared to $243.8 million in 2001 reflecting lower phosphate sales, due in part to the loss of a major European detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines. Somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at Foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro. Peroxygens (hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants) revenue decreased to $162.9 million in 2002 from $175.7 million in 2001 due to generally lower selling prices and lower persulfate volumes, reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market. Increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in non pulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of 2002, somewhat offset lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes. Overall we have maintained earnings levels recording $71.6 million of earnings in 2002 compared to $72.6 in the prior year. Relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs, significant cost savings from our 2002 and 2001 restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at Pocatello. Reacting to market weakness in Industrial Chemicals in 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of $12.4 million to improve our cost position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our Granger caustic facility and Spring Hill, West Virginia hydrogen peroxide facility. During 2001 we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business. Total charges for 2001 included an impairment charge of $224.2 million and restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million. Segment earnings do not include these charges. Asset impairments and restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results. See Asset Impairments and Restructuring and other charges above and Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. The restructuring of our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business in late 2001 has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus. Our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals businesss cost position should continue to improve as its PPA production increases. The shutdown of Pocatello also allowed FMC to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in 2002 and avoid significant start up and certain on going operating costs for environmental compliance issues at the site. The restructuring activities in 2002 should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at Spring Hill. Lower joint venture earnings at Astaris and lower volumes and price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities. Lower earnings from Astaris were due to a 8 percent decrease in sales to $445.7 million in 2002 from $486.2 million in the prior year. A decreased benefit from the former power resale contract with Idaho Power and higher than expected startup costs at Astariss PPA plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs. The total resale power benefit to Astaris in 2002 was approximately $12 million compared to approximately $34 million in 2001. This benefit will not continue in 2003. We generally foresee minimal improvement in economic and competitive conditions within Industrial Chemicals in 2003. Because of a deterioration at Astaris resulting from increased competitive rivalry at Astaris 35 and the lack of any benefit from the power resale we expect that equity losses from this joint venture will offset the anticipated improved profit performance of other products in our Industrial Chemicals segment in 2003. Furthermore, we expect to make keepwell payments based on Astariss 2003 performance. Results of Operations 2001 compared to 2000 Revenue was $1,943.0 million in 2001, down 5 percent from $2,050.3 million in 2000 reflecting weaker demand from the industrial markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business segment and lower sulfentrazone sales in our Agricultural Products business segment. Asset impairments totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) for 2001 compared to $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax) in 2000. Industrial Chemicals recorded an impairment charge of $224.2 million in 2001. A charge of $12.3 million was for the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations and $211.9 million was for the impairment of our U.S. based phosphorus business. We recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segments lithium operations in Argentina. We established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately five years ago in a remote area of the Andes Mountains. See Asset Impairments under Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 above for further details related to these charges. During 2000, we recorded asset impairments of $10.1 million ($6.2 million after tax). Impairments of $9.0 million were recognized because of the formation of Astaris, including the write down of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two phosphorus facilities. Other asset impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the Specialty Chemicals segment. Restructuring and other charges. A change in market conditions and in our corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) in 2001. A charge of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax) was recorded in 2000. Industrial Chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million in 2001. The majority of this charge, $241.7 million, was for restructuring and other charges associated with our U.S. based phosphorus operation. The balance of this charge, $6.2 million, was for restructuring activities at several sites including $5.7 million for the mothballing of our Granger soda ash facility. Also in 2001 we recorded $12.5 million of severance and other costs related to our Agricultural Products segment, as a result of our decision to refocus certain R&D activities. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002. Of the remaining 2001 charges, $20.0 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin off of Technologies and to several minor reorganization costs in our Specialty Chemicals segment. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2001 and the first half of 2002. We reduced our workforce by approximately 320 people in connection with our 2001 restructuring activities, the majority of which occurred within the same year. During 2000, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $35.2 million ($21.7 million after tax). Restructuring charges of $20.6 million were attributable to the formation of Astaris and the concurrent reorganization of our Industrial Chemicals sales, marketing and support organizations, the reduction of office space requirements in our Philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company. In addition, we recorded $12.5 million of environmental charges from increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties. Other restructuring charges included $2.1 million for other projects. Of the approximately 350 employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in 2000, 281 occurred at December 31, 2000 while the remainder occurred in 2001. 36 Interest expense, net in 2001 was $58.3 million compared to $61.8 million in 2000. The decrease in net interest expense in 2001 was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during the year. Income/loss from continuing operations was a loss of $306.3 million in 2001 compared to income of $125.6 million in 2000. Most of the decline can be attributed to asset impairments and restructuring and other charges of $603.5 million ($405.9 million after tax) in 2001 compared to charges of $45.3 million ($27.9 million after tax) in 2000. Also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting the chemical industry worldwide. Provision/benefit for income taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit of $166.6 million in 2001 resulting in an effective tax rate of 35.2 percent compared to income tax expense of $33.0 million and an effective tax rate of 20.8 percent in 2000. Discontinued operations. We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million after tax) in 2001. Included in this amount is a loss from Technologies of $19.6 million and a charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses. During 2000, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $17.7 million ($15.0 million after tax). Of this amount, $64.0 million were from the earnings of the spun off Technologies offset by an $80.0 million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued Defense Systems business. Net income/loss. We recorded a net loss of $337.7 million for 2001 compared to net income of $110.6 million in 2000. This variance reflects the effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Other Financial Data Capital expenditures were $145.6 million in 2001 compared to $197.3 million in 2000. Decreased capital expenditures in 2001 reflected lower spending related to environmental assets at Pocatello. The need for these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of Pocatello. The following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K). Corporate expenses were $36.3 million in 2001 and $36.2 million in 2000. Corporate expense represents shared costs of the segments that cannot be reasonably allocated. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other expense for the year was $1.6 million compared to net other income of $9.6 million in 2000. This variance is largely attributable to increased pension costs and lower amortization of a deferred pension asset. Segment Results 2001 compared to 2000 Segment operating profit is presented before income taxes, asset impairments, restructuring and other charges, interest expense, net and other income and expense, net. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Agricultural Products Agricultural Products revenue decreased to $653.1 million in 2001 from $664.7 million in 2000. Agricultural Products segment operating profit declined to $72.8 million, down 17 percent from 2000. Herbicides revenue decreased 7 percent to $163.6 million in 2001 compared to $175.9 million in 2000 reflecting the lack of sulfentrazone sales to DuPont in 2001. Herbicide sales were down reflecting these lower sulfentrazone sales; however, earnings in 2001 included a one time, profit protection payment from DuPont of $20 million (see below). Excluding this payment, segment operating profit decreased 40 percent in 2001. Total 37 sulfentrazone sales to DuPont were $16.2 million in 2000. Insecticide revenue totaled $489.5 million in 2001 compared to $488.8 million in 2000. The insecticide revenue decrease was mostly due to weakness in Asian and Latin American markets. In 1998 we entered into an exclusive agreement with DuPont to provide them sulfentrazone in North America for use on soybeans. However, the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001. DuPont no longer has exclusive rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in North America. We began developing new markets in 2001, expanding our sulfentrazone sales, including sales into the North America soybean market. We believe that we have recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the absence of DuPonts purchases. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Agricultural Products began a restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products. A restructuring charge of $12.5 million ($7.8 million after tax) was taken in 2001 to support these plans. Specialty Chemicals Specialty Chemicals revenue was $472.0 million in 2001, down from $488.8 million in 2000 due to lower revenue in both BioPolymer and lithium. Specialty Chemicals segment operating profit declined to $87.5 million, or 5 percent from $92.4 million in the prior year. BioPolymer revenue decreased to $341.2 million in 2001 compared to $350.8 million in 2000 due to a combination of a weaker euro, weaker demand from customer inventory corrections and lower selling prices for alginates and carrageenan in specialty markets. Lithium revenue decreased to $130.8 million in 2001 from $138.0 million in 2000 resulting from our strategic exit from the commodity lithium carbonate market and slower industrial markets, particularly in Europe. Industrial Chemicals Industrial Chemicals revenue decreased to $822.0 million in 2001, down 9 percent compared to $905.6 million in 2000. Industrial Chemicals segment operating profit declined by 36.6 percent to $72.6 million in 2001 from $114.5 million in 2000. Alkali revenue was relatively flat in 2001 at $402.5 million compared to $402.0 million in the prior year. Peroxygens revenue (hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants) of $175.7 million in 2001 compared to $189.2 million in 2000 was down despite the price increases initiated in late 2000 and the application of an energy surcharge in early 2001. Foret, our Spanish operation, recorded revenue of $243.8 million compared to $235.2 million in 2000 reflecting strong phosphate and zeolite markets. The 2001 and 2000 revenue comparison was further affected by the inclusion of sales from our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business in the first three months of 2000, which totaled $79.2 million. Subsequent to March of 2000, U.S. phosphorus chemical sales have been deconsolidated and reflected through our equity investment in Astaris. Lower operating profit reflected economic weakness during the year, increased power costs, consent decree spending at Pocatello and the PPA plant startup costs. During 2001 we continued to execute our business plan for our Industrial Chemicals business segment which included significant restructuring activities as well as our continued review of long term assets for impairment. The goal was to mitigate the future effects of the anticipated economic slowdown as well as prepare the business for long term growth while maximizing cash generation. Asset impairments totaled $224.2 million and restructuring and other charges related to these activities totaled $247.9 million in 2001. Restructuring and other charges included $96.5 million for restructuring activities in our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals and cyanide businesses and $151.4 million of other charges related to our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business. New Accounting Standards Adopted On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. For further discussion of the effect of this recently adopted standard see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. 38 On January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. The Statement retains most of the requirements of SFAS No. 121 related to the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used. There was no impact of adopting SFAS No. 144 in 2002. In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB No. 14, and Technical Corrections. The Statement rescinds or amends a number of existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. In 2002, with the retirement of our Meridian Gold debentures, we elected to adopt SFAS No. 145 early and recorded a $3.1 million loss ($1.9 million after tax) in 2002 related to the early retirement of these debentures in selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 145. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosure about the guarantors obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and the disclosure requirements are effective after December 15, 2002, and are included in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure An amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 (SFAS No. 148). This statement amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 regarding disclosure requirements for condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods. We have determined that our company will not make the voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. On January 1, 2001, we implemented SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively, the Statement). The Statement required our company to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments to be recorded in current earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedging transaction and whether a derivative is designated as an effective hedge. In accordance with the provisions of the Statement, we recorded a first quarter 2001 loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $0.9 million after tax in the consolidated statement of earnings, and a deferred gain of $16.4 million after tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss. New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We expect to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in 2003, as required. The effects of adoption, if any, are currently being evaluated. 39 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This standard addresses the accounting and reporting for costs of so called exit activities (including restructuring) and for the disposal of long lived assets. The standard changes some of the criteria for recognizing a liability for these activities. It is effective beginning in 2003 with the liability recognition criteria under the standard applied prospectively. We will adopt SFAS No. 146 beginning in 2003 and are evaluating the potential impact of adoption on our accounting policies regarding exit and disposal activities. Environmental Obligations Our company, like other industrial manufacturers, is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. We believe strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, public health and employee safety. This responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes. When issues arise, including notices from the EPA or other government agencies identifying our company as a PRP, our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues. When necessary, we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental, legal, financial and communications personnel to ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health, as well as to our employees and shareholders. We provided environmental provisions totaling $10.2 million in 2002. This included charges related to environmental sites of discontinued businesses and continuing operating sights. In 2001 we provided $68.8 million of environmental provisions related to operating and discontinued sites, of which $47.4 million was for additional remediation related to the shutdown of Pocatello. In the second quarter of 2000, we provided environmental provisions totaling $12.5 million related to ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties. Additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 11, respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Estimates of 2002 environmental spending are included in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2002, we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned business operations by completing a series of financing transactions. On June 12, 2002, we issued 3.25 million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of $101.3 million to reduce amounts borrowed under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This was the first step in a refinancing plan in which we intended subsequently to issue unsecured bonds and renew and extend the maturity of our $240.0 million revolving credit facility. In June 2003, subsequent to the completion of our common stock offering, Moodys lowered its rating of our long term debt from Baa3 to Ba1. Moodys rating of Baa3 is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty long term debt ratings. Its downgrade of our long term debt rating by one level to Ba1, or the eleventh of twenty ratings, was from its lowest investment grade rating to the highest level of the non investment grade category. Moodys also lowered its rating of our short term debt from P 3 to NP, the fourth level from the top of its five level short term debt ratings scale. Subsequent to these actions by Moodys, we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Also resulting from the downgrade in our credit ratings, availability decreased under our former accounts receivable securitization program, which was offset by increased borrowings under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The ratings downgrades resulted in several changes to our refinancing plan. 40 On October 21, 2002, we completed a refinancing in which we issued $355.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25 percent senior secured notes due 2009 (the Notes) at a discount of $4.4 million. Simultaneously, we entered into a new $500.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), which provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million term loan facility, and obtained a $40.0 million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility (the Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility and together with the Credit Agreement, the Credit Facilities). On October 21, 2002 we obtained $244.9 million, net of discounts, from the Credit Agreements term loan facility. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes and borrowings under the Credit Agreement totaling $595.5 million were used to: Fund $260.0 million into a debt reserve account (the Debt Reserve Account), included in restricted cash, to redeem $99.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.125 percent medium term notes due November 2002 and $160.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375 percent debentures due in September 2003. Repay all borrowings under and terminate our former $240.0 revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, which had outstanding amounts of $136.1 million and $65.0 million, respectively, both of which were terminated on October 21, 2002; Fund into a restricted cash account (the Restricted Cash Collateral Account), included in restricted cash, $130.8 million to refinance and replace with cash collateral certain surety bonds and letters of credit supporting self insurance programs, environmental obligations and future business commitments and provide $43.4 million of cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds; and Pay fees and expenses of approximately $21 million, which included bank fees, and various other costs. The Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility was utilized in connection with our refinancing to provide letters of credit totaling $39.9 million in support of self insurance programs and environmental obligations. Among other restrictions, the Credit Facilities contain financial covenants related to leverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt), interest coverage (measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings), consolidated net worth and capital spending. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2002. See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for a summary of the terms for both the Notes and the new Credit Facilities. Prior to the completion of our refinancing, we obtained funding through an accounts receivable securitization program. We sold receivables, without recourse, through our wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary, FMC Funding Corporation, which then sold the receivables to an unrelated finance company. The sold receivables and repurchase obligations related to the securitization program were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for our former accounts receivable securitization program was in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. The transfer of accounts receivable qualified as a sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 140 as a result of our surrender of control of these financial assets, without recourse, in exchange for cash. Accordingly, we recorded a reduction of accounts receivable equal to the total amount of cash received from FMC Funding Corporation in connection with the transaction. The downgrade of our long term debt rating by Moodys in June 2002 reduced the funds available to us from this program. Funds from the accounts receivable securitization totaled $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. On October 21, 2002 we terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with proceeds from our new financing. We maintained a $240.0 million committed revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in December 2002. The total amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2001 was $68.0 million. In January 2002, we obtained a supplemental $50.0 million committed credit facility to meet short term seasonal financing needs. In August 2002, this supplemental credit facility was amended to reduce its availability to $25.0 million and to extend its maturity to October 31, 2002. Upon completion of our refinancing we repaid 41 outstanding borrowings of $136.1 million and terminated the $240.0 million revolving credit facility with the proceeds from our refinancing. We also terminated the supplemental credit facility, under which there were no outstanding borrowings when terminated. At December 31, 2002, we had total debt of $1,267.0 million compared to debt of $923.5 million as of December 31, 2001. This included $64.3 million of short term debt at December 31, 2002, comprised almost entirely of foreign borrowings, compared to $136.5 million at December 31, 2001. There were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our new Credit Agreement at December 31, 2002. During 2002 significant events affecting our liquidity included: Spending against restructuring and other reserves of $91.8 million, including paying $32.3 million for the shutdown and remediation our Pocatello plant; paying $131.6 million for scheduled maturities and for redemptions of long term debt; paying $32.5 million to redeem all of the outstanding 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures; redeeming $17.1 million of our 6.375 percent debentures due September 2003 and issuing 3.25 million shares of common stock with net proceeds of $101.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 were $89.6 million and $23.4 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities was $136.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to cash required by operating activities of $52.9 million in 2001 and cash provided by operating activities of $272.4 million in 2000. Historically, cash flows from operating activities have funded a substantial portion of our cash requirements. In 2002 and 2001 cash from operating activities was reduced by the net cash impact of spending related to our restructuring and other charges. Included in our operating cash activities in 2002 is $63.8 million for spending on restructuring and other activities, including $32.3 million for the shutdown and remediation of Pocatello. The future spending against restructuring reserves related to the Pocatello shutdown of $53.0 million at December 2002 is expected to continue through 2007 with progressively less spent in each of the future years. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased significantly in 2002 reflecting lower business activity, including lower inventory, in 2002 than in 2001. Also favorably affecting our 2002 cash provided by operating activities was improved collections of accounts receivable especially within Agricultural Products, particularly in Latin America. Cash required by discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $29.6 million, $111.9 million and $50.1 million, respectively. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses. In the first quarter of 2001 the company made an $80.0 million payment for the settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business. Cash required by investing activities was $110.8 million, $169.6 million, and $97.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The majority of this spending related to capital additions to our property, plant and equipment to maintain operating standards and comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Also included in investing activities are keepwells to Astaris of $29.6 million and $31.3 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. A planned reduction in capital spending in 2002 compared to 2001 contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities. Additionally, 2001 included approximately $43 million for spending on environmental remediation assets at Pocatello. The fourth quarter 2001 decision to shut down Pocatello enabled us to curtail this spending. Cash required by investing activities in 2000 was reduced by a net cash distribution by Astaris to FMC of $88.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities for 2002 of $65.8 million decreased by $271.3 million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of $346.7 million in 2001. Our 2002 financing activities included a net increase in long term debt of $384.1 million from net proceeds of our refinancing of $595.5 million. The current years activity also reflects $181.2 million paid to redeem long term debt, a $37.8 million decrease in our vendor 42 financing and $65.0 million paid to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program in October 2002. This program had an outstanding balance of $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. Our long term debt repayments included payments of $10.4 million, $25.0 million and $99.5 million, respectively, in the first, second and fourth quarters of 2002 for scheduled maturities, the redemption of $17.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.37 percent debentures due September 2003 and several other minor maturities. We also made payments of $32.5 million to redeem all outstanding 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures. Financing sources included $101.3 million, net of issuance costs, from the issuance of 3.25 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2002, which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former $240.0 million revolving credit facility, which was terminated upon the completion of our refinancing in October 2002. Our 2001 financing activities included $430.7 million from the IPO of Technologies, net of contributions to Technologies to support their operating cash needs. Commitments and other potential liquidity needs Our 2003 cash needs include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled maturities of long term debt, equity contributions to Astaris, an expected contingent payment due at year end 2003 related to the acquisition of Tg Soda Ash, environmental spending and restructuring spending. We plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new Credit Agreement. We have provided an agreement to lenders of Astaris under which we have agreed to make equity contributions to Astaris sufficient to make up one half of shortfalls in Astariss earnings below certain levels. Astariss earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2002 and 2001 and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2003. We contributed $29.6 million to Astaris under this arrangement in 2002 and $31.3 million in 2001. We expect our equity contributions to Astaris in 2003 to be between $35 million and $50 million. The proportional amount of Astariss indebtedness subject to this agreement from FMC was approximately $84.0 million at December 31, 2002. In 2002, certain amendments to the agreement under which FMC makes equity contributions to Astaris that were necessary to complete our refinancing were obtained from Astariss lenders. On June 30, 1999, we acquired Tg Soda Ash, Inc. from Elf Atochem North America, Inc. for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end 2003. The contingent payment amount, which will be based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003, cannot currently be determined precisely but is expected to be in the range of $40.0 million to $45.0 million. Projected 2003 spending also includes approximately $50 million of environmental remediation spending, of which $25 million relates to Pocatello and $25 million for other operating and discontinued business sites. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $7 million and $9 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $20 million to $25 million annually in 2003 and in 2004 for environmental compliance costs, which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves. Other commitments that could affect our liquidity include the following: In connection with the spin off of Technologies, we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling $289.0 million at December 31, 2001. Contractual releases obtained by FMC have reduced this amount to $14.5 million at December 31, 2002. We expect this amount to decline further in 2003. Contingent obligations include guarantees of the performance of Technologies under various customer contracts, reimbursements on behalf of Technologies under letters of credit, and guarantees of indebtedness of Technologies. We have a guaranty agreement from Technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to satisfy these obligations. Because of our expectation that the underlying obligations will be met and the existence of the guarantee from Technologies, we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these contingent obligations. 43 In the ordinary course of business, we provide credit enhancements to governmental agencies, insurance companies, and others for our environmental obligations, self insurance programs and other future business commitments. As part of our refinancing, we funded $130.8 million into a Restricted Cash Collateral Account, to provide for future cash collateralization of a portion of these obligations. Additionally, we obtained $39.9 million of standby letters of credit under our Supplemental Letter of Credit Facility. At December 31, 2002 there was $41.0 million principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by $43.4 million in bank letters of credit. Subsequent to December 31, 2002, as part of our refinancing, we obtained sufficient cash to collateralize, fully, these letters of credit. We provide parent guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. The outstanding amounts of debt guaranteed were $64.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002 and 2001. We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers in Brazil for their seasonal borrowing needs. The customers obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops. The total of these guarantees at December 31, 2002 was $18.2 million compared to $56.0 million at December 31, 2001. We also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers in Brazil to support their importation of third party agricultural products. These guarantees totaled $4.5 million and $10.0 million December 31, 2002 and at December 31, 2001, respectively. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows: Expected Cash Payments by Year Contractual Commitments 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 & beyond Total (In Millions) Short term debt $ 64.3 $ $ $ $ $ 64.3 Long term debt maturities (1) 167.8 3.1 63.3 3.4 975.0 1,212.6 Lease obligations (2) 28.4 26.8 25.1 18.6 94.5 193.4 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 3.4 1.8 0.4 5.6 Tg Soda Ash contingent payment (3) 40.0 40.0 Astaris keepwell payments (4) 35.0 35.0 Total $ 338.9 $ 31.7 $ 88.8 $ 22.0 $ 1,069.5 $ 1,550.9 (1) Before discounts. (2) Before recoveries. (3) Based on the low end of our estimated range. (4) Astaris keepwell payments are based on the low end of our estimated range of possible 2003 keepwell payments. Dividends On November 29, 2001, our Board of Directors approved the spin off of the remaining 83 percent of Technologies making it an independent publicly traded company. The spin off qualified as a tax free distribution to U.S. stockholders. Stockholders of record as of December 31, 2001 received approximately 1.72 shares of common stock of the new company for every 1.0 share of our stock. Fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on December 31, 2001. No cash dividends were paid in 2002. No cash dividends were paid in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above. No cash dividends were paid in 2000. No cash dividends are expected to be paid in 2003. 44 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize cash flow exposure to changes in currency and exchange rates through a controlled program of risk management by entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market value foreign currency risk is calculated by us, using a third party software model which uses standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (spot and forward exchange rates) as of the valuation date. The market value energy price risk is calculated by a third party. At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $5.7 million and $25.9 million, respectively. The change in the net financial instrument position was due to improved positions in our natural gas forward contracts due to increased energy prices somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency forward contracts against a strengthening euro. Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio at December 31, 2002 is composed of 74 percent fixed rate debt and 26 percent variable rate debt. The largest portion of our variable rate debt is from our $250.0 million term loan facility which was outstanding for approximately two months in 2002. The majority of our debt portfolio at December 31, 2001 was composed of fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the variable rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position. Based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly affect net income in either year. Commodity Price Risk Energy costs are approximately 8 percent of our cost of sales and services. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas. Below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing energy prices. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 percent change in natural gas prices from their levels at December 31, 2002 and December 31 2001 with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. A 10 percent increase in New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMX) prices would result in a decrease of $6.2 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at December 31, 2002 and decrease of $5.2 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2001. A 10 percent decrease in NYMX prices would result in increases of $4.3 million and $7.5 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the euro versus the Norwegian krone, the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. A 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a increase of $8.6 million in the net liability position and a decrease of $7.5 million in the net asset position into a net liability of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. A 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of $8.2 million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and an increase of $8.0 million in the net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. 45
