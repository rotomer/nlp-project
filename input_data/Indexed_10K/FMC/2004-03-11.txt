ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Company We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. Agricultural Products Our Agricultural Products segment manufactures and sells proprietary, branded insecticides and herbicides. We have a strong position in two widely used classes of insecticides, pyrethroids and carbamates, and possess a niche portfolio of proprietary herbicides. These products are used for the protection of cotton, corn, rice, cereals, vegetables and other crops. In addition, in North America we sell into the professional pest control and home and garden markets. We differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions, and by leveraging proprietary chemistries and pest specific research and development (R&D) to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products. We have also developed strategic alliances with companies such as Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. (ISK), a Japanese crop protection company, to access new markets and develop new insecticides. Specialty Chemicals Our Specialty Chemicals segment is comprised of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses. BioPolymer manufactures and sells microcrystalline cellulose, carrageenan and alginates, products that add texture, structure and physical stability to a wide range of beverage, dairy, meat and bakery products and or that act as binders and disintegrants for tablets and capsules. Our lithium business is a technology based business in which mined lithium is processed and sold for use in a broad array of specialty products, including pharmaceuticals, specialty polymers and energy storage devices. The majority of Specialty Chemicals sales are to customers engaged in non cyclical end markets, such as food and pharmaceuticals. Industrial Chemicals Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. Through our manufacturing facility in Green River, Wyoming, we process naturally occurring soda ash, a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass. We produce hydrogen peroxide, leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout North America to reach our customers. We also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics, polymers and food processing industries. Our European subsidiary, FMC Foret, S.A. (Foret), leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals, peroxygens, sulfur derivatives, silicates, zeolites and other products in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We are also a 50 percent owner with Solutia Inc. (Solutia) of Astaris LLC (Astaris), a North American producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets, including the detergent, food, agricultural and industrial markets. We account for Astaris as an equity investment. The majority of Industrial Chemicals sales are to customers engaged in relatively cyclical end markets. 25 The Reorganization of Our Company We implemented our plan to split FMC into separate chemical and machinery companies in 2001 through a two step process. The first step included an initial public offering (IPO) of 17 percent of FMC Technologies, Inc. (Technologies), which took place in the second quarter of 2001. Technologies consists of our former Energy Systems and Food and Transportation Systems business segments. Subsequent to the IPO, Technologies made net payments of $430.7 million to FMC in exchange for the net assets distributed to Technologies on June 1, 2001, which we used to retire short term and long term debt. The second step, the distribution of our remaining 83 percent ownership in Technologies (the spin off) occurred on December 31, 2001. Total net assets distributed on December 31, 2001 were $509.5 million. We believe that the spin off of Technologies has allowed us to focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation, increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses. In an effort to align our business with our future growth plans, we took various strategic measures in 2003, 2002 and 2001, including the restructuring of businesses, reduction of staff, plant shut downs, plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets. We believe these steps have increased our financial flexibility, particularly as operating conditions change. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental We provide for environmental related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the EPA, or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a ROD, or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a RI/FS that is accepted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. 26 Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named PRPs or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by CERCLA and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site by site basis. Our liability includes managements best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. We have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies, U.S. government agencies and other third parties, of $17.0 million and $27.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and 2002. These recoveries are recorded as an offset to Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued. Cash recoveries for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $10.7 million, $16.2 million and $12.5 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2003 we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $75.0 million. We recorded total environmental provisions related to both operating and discontinued sites of $24.9 million, $10.2 million and $68.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Impairments and valuation of long lived assets Our long lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We recognized $323.1 million in asset impairments in 2001 related to our Industrial Chemicals segment. No such impairments were recognized in either 2002 or 2003. We prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets based on estimated discounted cash flows. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2003 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Total goodwill as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $156.3 million and $129.7 million, respectively and is related to our Specialty Chemicals segment. The change in goodwill is due to the effects of currency exchange. Depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset. Estimated useful lives are based on historical useful life trends as well as common industry practice. Useful lives are as follows: 20 years land improvements, 20 to 50 years buildings (depending on location and use), 3 to 18 years machinery and equipment (depending on type and use). Depreciation expense totaled $112.5 million, $105.2 million and $112.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including 27 interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We recorded $7.7 million, $4.9 million and $4.0 million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, $97.7 million and $106.6 million, respectively, was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of $43.2 million and $84.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders equity. We made voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of $7.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for 2003 and 2002. In addition, we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of $2.4 million and $4.1 million, for 2003 and 2002, respectively. We paid postretirement benefits, net of participant contributions, of $6.6 million and $7.5 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our estimated cash contributions for 2004 include approximately $4 million in nonqualified pension benefits, approximately $7 million in postretirement benefits, and we are considering making voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $8 million. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of high quality corporate bonds (with particular focus on the Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) Aa rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices) towards the end of each respective year. Bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least 20 years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately 30 years. We selected a discount rate of 6.25 percent at December 31, 2003 for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a long term, average rate of return to be earned on the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In developing the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plans trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of 12.5 percent over the last 10 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities (U.S. and non U.S.) and 30 percent fixed income investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent, is between nine percent and eleven percent for both U.S. and non U.S. equities, and between five percent and seven percent for fixed income 28 investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below. The other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic other postretirement benefit costs noted above do not reflect the effects of the Medicare, Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act). Specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the subsidy included in the Medicare Act is still pending and once issued may require us to change previously reported information. We have elected to defer the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $47.7 million at December 31, 2003 and $47.6 million at December 31, 2002, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.2 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A one half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $52.5 million at December 31, 2003 and $50.5 million at December 31, 2002, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $4.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A one half percent increase in the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $3.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A one half percent decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $3.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs are found in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the valuation allowance was $39.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively. 29 Results of Operations 2003, 2002 and 2001 Overview All results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses. The results of Technologies, which was spun off on December 31, 2001, have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2001 and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2001. (See The Reorganization of Our Company for an overview of our spin off of Technologies.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Basic) (1) (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) Consolidated Revenue $ 1,921.4 $ 1,852.9 $ 1,943.0 Net income (loss) $ 26.5 $ 0.75 $ 65.8 $ 1.92 $ (337.7 ) $ (10.86 ) Net income included the following after tax charges: Restructuring and other charges (gains) $ (4.8 ) $ (0.13 ) $ 18.4 $ 0.54 $ 172.1 $ 5.53 Astaris restructuring (2) 32.5 0.91 Asset impairments 233.8 7.52 Discontinued operations 13.3 0.37 3.3 0.09 30.5 0.98 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 0.9 0.03 Total after tax charges included in net income (loss) $ 41.0 $ 1.15 $ 21.7 $ 0.63 $ 437.3 $ 14.06 (1) In 2001, we did not use the diluted average shares outstanding, as they would be anti dilutive. We used basic average shares outstanding for this table. (2) Our share of charges recorded by Astaris, the phosphorous joint venture is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates. See Segment Results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2003, 2002 and 2001. Results of Operations 2003 compared to 2002 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ending December 31, 2003 and prior year refers to the year ending December 31, 2002. All comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1,921.4 million up 4 percent compared with $1,852.9 million in the prior year. This increase was due to a stronger Euro, growth in Specialty Chemicals sales in the pharmaceutical market and increased Agricultural Products sales in Latin America and Europe. Restructuring and other charges (gains) totaled $(5.1) million ($(4.8) million after tax) in 2003 compared with $30.1 million ($18.4 million after tax) in 2002. The before tax gain of $5.1 million we recorded in 2003 was the result of a gain on the sale of an office building in Foret, our Spanish subsidiary, offset by charges in all segments. The gain on the building was $11.9 million, net of related costs, including severance. Severance costs were recorded in Industrial Chemicals and in both our Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. Total 2003 severance charges, including amounts recorded at Foret, were $5.7 million and related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from FMC in late 2003. The remaining charges in the year included non cash charges totaling $2.8 million primarily for the abandonment of an asset in the Specialty Chemicals segment, offset by the reversal of certain workforce related and facility shutdown reserves in Corporate (as shown in the table in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K) resulting from our ability to meet certain obligations on more favorable terms than expected when the reserves were established. The remaining other charges of $2.2 million, were related to environmental costs at operating sites, largely in our Industrial Chemicals segment. 30 In 2002, restructuring and other charges of $30.1 million, before tax, consisted of charges related to each of our segments. The details, by segment, are discussed below. In an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in $12.4 million of restructuring charges. Included in this amount was a $5.7 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in Spring Hill, West Virginia. We also mothballed our Granger facility, in Green River, Wyoming resulting in a $3.4 million restructuring charge. The majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance, all of which occurred in 2002. In addition we recorded a $3.3 million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our U.S. phosphorus chemicals business, alkali, peroxygens and at Foret. There were 150 severances related to these restructurings, all of which occurred in 2002. In Agricultural Products we incurred $4.7 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which $3.7 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy (See Segment Results 2002 compared to 2001). A $1.0 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in Europe, which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our European markets. Of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002. We recorded $1.3 million of restructuring charges in our Specialty Chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within BioPolymer, both domestically and internationally. The majority of these costs resulted from the severance of 24 people, which occurred in the first half of 2003. Reorganization costs of $3.0 million and other charges of $8.7 million were also recorded in 2002. These charges are discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Also, of the $30.1 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 $11.9 million was spent in 2002. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was a loss of $68.6 million in 2003 versus earnings of $4.7 million in 2002. The loss in 2003 included charges totaling $53.3 million related to the previously announced restructuring program at Astaris, LLP (Astaris) our 50/50 joint venture. Weaker affiliate earnings were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract, which had a prior year pre tax benefit of approximately $12 million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure. (See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for further details.) Interest expense, net increased by 29 percent to $92.2 million in 2003 compared to $71.6 million in 2002 reflecting higher interest costs in 2003 from our refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2002. (See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for further details on our refinancing and related 2003 amendment.) Provisions (benefit) for income taxes were a benefit of $1.8 million in 2003 compared with a provision of $17.4 million for 2002 reflecting tax rates of (4.7)% and 20.1%, respectively. The tax rate in 2003 was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S. Income we earn outside of the U.S. is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically. In addition, dividends received from our foreign operations and a change in the valuation allowance, further contributed to the change in the provision (benefit) for income taxes from 2002 to 2003. In 2002, the tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of depletion and differing foreign tax rates. (See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for further details.) Discontinued operations. We recorded after tax charges of $13.3 million and $3.3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are 31 responsible for environmental compliance. (See Discontinued Operations Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for further details.) Net income decreased to $26.5 million in 2003 compared with $65.8 million in 2002 reflecting increased interest expense, net, and lower earnings from our Industrial Chemicals segment somewhat offset by higher earnings in our other segments. In addition, net income for 2003 included restructuring and other charges (gains), Astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations totaling $41.0 million after tax or $1.15 per share on a diluted basis. As noted in the table under Overview above, these charges related primarily to restructuring programs, particularly at our Astaris affiliate, reported in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates, but also included a gain on the sale of an office building and an after tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of $13.3 million. Prior year net income included after tax restructuring and other charges of $18.4 million also related to primarily to restructuring in Industrial Chemicals, and an after tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of $3.3 million. We expect net income to improve in 2004 compared to 2003 mostly through improvement in Industrial Chemicals particularly due to better performance from Astaris as a result of their restructuring efforts, continued growth in Specialty Chemicals and lower interest expense. Other Financial Data Capital expenditures totaled $87.0 million in 2003 compared with $83.9 million in 2002. The following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K). Corporate expenses increased to $37.3 million from $35.6 million in 2002 primarily due to higher insurance costs. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses, LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other income was $4.3 million higher than the 2002 loss of $0.4 million. This variance is largely attributable to a LIFO adjustment and the impact of foreign currency. Segment Results 2003 compared to 2002 Segment operating profit is presented before taxes, asset impairments, restructuring and other charges (gains), interest expense, net and other income and expense, net. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Agricultural Products Year EndedDecember 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2003 2002 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 640.1 $ 615.1 $ 25.0 4 % Operating Profit 82.0 69.5 12.5 18 The increase in sales was driven by growth in all regions, except North America, and was largely achieved in the fourth quarter of the year. Latin America and Europe showed the most significant growth as the year 32 closed. Sales in Latin America, particularly Brazil, were driven by improved market conditions, and higher sales of proprietary herbicides and insecticides used on such crops as cotton and sugar cane. Stronger European sales resulted from a number of factors, including a stronger euro, new approved uses for propriety herbicides referred to as new labels, and our overall efforts to focus on higher value, proprietary products. These increases more than offset the decrease in North American insecticide sales into the crop protection market due to lower than average pest pressures. Our professional pest control and home and garden business also saw continued growth during 2003. Because of this regional sales mix, insecticides were essentially flat for the year, while higher sales of herbicides resulted in most of the revenue increase versus 2002. For 2003, our Agricultural Products revenues are made up of 76 percent insecticides and 24 percent herbicides. The segment earnings improvement was a result of higher sales, improved product mix related to our focus on higher value proprietary products and lower production costs, some of which was related to our outsourcing strategy in some product lines. Also contributing to the improvement was lower selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe that Agricultural Products will continue to successfully execute its strategies in 2004, but expect revenue growth to be essentially flat. This expectation is dependent on normal pest pressures in North America during 2004. Specialty Chemicals Year EndedDecember 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2003 2002 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 515.8 $ 488.2 $ 27.6 6 % Operating Profit 102.1 89.8 12.3 14 BioPolymer, which generated 71 percent of 2003 segment revenues, had sales increases of 4 percent while sales in our lithium business, which represents 29 percent of the segment, increased by more than 10 percent compared with 2002. Segment sales increases were driven by U.S. and European growth in BioPolymers MCC products in the pharmaceuticals market, where MCC is used as a binder and disintegrant in tablets. These increases were partially offset by lower BioPolymer sales in our food business, largely as a result of lower demand in the nutritional beverage market. Also contributing were strong lithium sales in the pharmaceutical synthesis market and in the energy storage market from military demand for rechargeable batteries. In addition, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily the Euro, further contributed to the increase in revenue. Segment earnings increased due to higher sales, favorable foreign currency translation, improved productivity and sales mix. In 2003, responding to changes in the food business, BioPolymer took actions to reduce costs within the business and exited certain end markets. For 2004, we expect continued improvements in operating profit and middle single digit growth in sales. Industrial Chemicals Year EndedDecember 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2003 2002 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 770.6 $ 753.4 $ 17.2 2 % Operating Profit 34.0 71.6 (37.6 ) (53 ) 33 Industrial Chemicals sales increased due almost entirely to Foret, our European Industrial Chemicals business, where favorable currency translation and higher peroxygen selling prices resulted in a 16 percent increase in sales compared with 2002. European prices for peroxygens were driven by higher capacity utilization levels coupled with strong demand. The increased sales at Foret were partially offset by decreased revenues in our largely North American based Alkali and peroxygens (hydrogen peroxides and active oxidants) businesses, where sales in 2003 decreased 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. The decrease in Alkali was largely a result of lower export prices for soda ash, Alkalis primary product, due in part to recent capacity additions in China. Our international sales of soda ash are through the ANSAC, a foreign sales corporation. Despite successful implementation of some selling price increases, peroxygen sales decreased due to weaker North American hydrogen peroxide volumes to the pulp market. For 2003, our Industrial Chemicals segment revenue is made up of 46 percent Alkali, 34 percent Foret and 19 percent peroxygens. Lower segment earnings in 2003 were largely the result of significantly lower affiliate earnings from Astaris and lower sales in our Alkali and domestic peroxygen businesses. Weaker affiliate earnings from Astaris were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract, which had a prior year pre tax benefit of approximately $12 million, and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure. In 2003, Astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance. The restructuring, which includes the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) market, is expected to reduce fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and result in improvement in the ventures position in food and technical phosphates. The restructuring is expected to be completed over the next six months and will include four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three Astaris sites. Our portion of Astaris 2003 restructuring charges, which totaled $53.3 million, before tax, were recorded in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates. Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1,852.9 million compared to $1,943.0 million in 2001, down 5 percent. Lower revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally attributable to lower revenue in our Industrial Chemicals and Agricultural Products segments. Our Industrial Chemicals segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions. Also affecting revenue were decreased Agricultural Products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in Asia. Asset impairments. There were no asset impairments in 2002. Asset impairments totaled $323.1 million ($233.8 million after tax) in 2001. Based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets, we recorded asset impairment charges in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments in 2001. Industrial Chemicals recorded impairment charges of $224.2 million of which $12.3 million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while $211.9 million was for the impairments in our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business. A weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of 2001. We subsequently exited this business in 2002. Our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our 50 percent interest in Astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus business, which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former Astaris elemental phosphorus plant in Pocatello, Idaho. Based upon a comprehensive review of our long lived assets, we recorded asset impairment charges of $211.9 million related to our U.S. based phosphorus business in the second quarter of 2001. The components of asset impairments related to this business include a $171.0 million impairment of environmental assets built to 34 comply with a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Consent Decree (the Consent Decree) at the Pocatello, Idaho facility, a further $4.4 million of other non environmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a $36.5 million impairment charge for our investment in Astaris. Driving these charges were a decline in market conditions, the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second PPA plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the Shoshone Bannock Tribes (the Tribal Fund) resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the Consent Decree, which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at Pocatello. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $98.9 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segments lithium operations in Argentina. We established this operation, which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities, approximately six years ago in a remote area of the Andes Mountains. The entry of a South American manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues. In addition, market conditions continued to be unfavorable. As a result, our lithium assets in Argentina became impaired, as the total capital invested was not expected to be recovered. Restructuring and other charges totaled $30.1 million ($18.4 million after tax) in 2002 compared to $280.4 million ($172.1 million after tax) in 2001. In 2002, restructuring and other charges of $30.1 million, before tax, consisted of charges related to each of our segments. The details, by segment, are discussed below. In an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in $12.4 million of restructuring charges. Included in this amount was a $5.7 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in Spring Hill, West Virginia. We also mothballed our Granger facility, in Green River, Wyoming resulting in a $3.4 million restructuring charge. The majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance, all of which occurred in 2002. In addition we recorded a $3.3 million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our U.S. phosphorus chemicals business, alkali, peroxygens and at Foret. There were 150 severances related to these restructurings, all of which occurred in 2002. In Agricultural Products we incurred $4.7 million of restructuring charges in 2002, of which $3.7 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy (See Segment Results 2002 compared to 2001). A $1.0 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in Europe, which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our European markets. Of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002. We recorded $1.3 million of restructuring charges in our Specialty Chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within BioPolymer, both domestically and internationally. The majority of these costs resulted in the severance of 24 people. These severances occurred in 2003. Reorganization costs of $3.0 million and other charges of $8.7 million were also recorded in the period. These charges are discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Also, of the $30.1 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002, $11.9 million was spent in 2002. 35 In 2001 a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of $280.4 million, detailed as follows: Gross Recoveries Net (3) (in Millions) U.S. Phosphorus Chemicals Business: Consent Decree obligation $ 68.7 $ (34.5 )(1) $ 34.2 Financing commitments to Astaris 42.7 Tribal Fund 40.0 Other Phosphorus restructuring 12.0 Pocatello shutdown: Shutdown activities 58.7 (29.6 )(2) 29.1 Remediation 54.3 (6.9 )(2) 47.4 FMCs share of Astaris shutdown obligations 36.3 Total U.S. Phosphorus Chemicals Business 241.7 Workforce related/facility shutdown 21.2 FMCs reorganization 17.5 Total 2001 Restructuring and other charges $ 280.4 (1) Partial reversal of Consent Decree obligations. (2) Commitment from Astaris related to shutdown and remediation. (3) See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Industrial Chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million in 2001 of which $6.2 million was for restructuring at several sites, including $5.7 million for the mothballing of our Granger, Wyoming soda ash facility, and $241.7 million was for our U.S. based phosphorus business. There were 130 severances from the restructuring of Industrial Chemicals, the majority of which occurred in 2001, with the remainder occurring in 2002. In connection with the impairment of our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of 2001 we recorded other charges for a $68.7 million reserve for further required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams, $42.7 million for financing obligations to the Astaris joint venture (keepwell payments) and a $40.0 million payment to the Tribal Fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at Pocatello. Subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of 2001, the Astaris joint venture announced its plans, in October 2001, to cease production at the Pocatello, Idaho elemental phosphorus facility in December 2001. This decision reflected the shift in Astaris sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA, and also reflected the availability of low cost alternative feedstock materials, projected higher future environmental compliance costs at Pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the Consent Decree. In connection with the decision to shut down Pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of $76.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. We spent $32.3 million and $0.9 million of these reserves in 2002 and 2001, respectively, with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next 5 to 7 years as we manage the sites decommissioning and environmental issues. These charges included reserves for decontamination, demolition, and other shut down costs of $58.7 million; environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of $54.3 million and our 50 percent share of costs recorded by Astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown, or $36.3 million. Offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of $34.5 million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2001 for required Consent Decree spending at the Pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending. We also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from Astaris to pay us 36 $36.5 million over the next 5 years, reflecting the joint ventures obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site. We received $3.7 million from Astaris in 2002 related to this commitment. Also included in the $241.7 million of restructuring and other charges related to the U.S. based phosphorus business was a charge of $12.0 million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of Pocatello. Included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at Pocatello. The decision to shut down Pocatello was consistent with Astaris plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost PPA. High energy, operating and environmental costs of producing elemental phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of PPA. The decision to shut down Pocatello in the fourth quarter of 2001 has allowed us to avoid spending of $34.5 million for the remaining capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any start up costs for this plant, which could have been significant. Further, there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could escalate in future years and add further costs. In addition, estimated future costs at Astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at Pocatello in 2004 at an estimated cost of $10.0 million. In 2001 we recorded $12.5 million of severance and other costs related to our Agricultural Products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our R&D resources to our core strength in insecticides. The majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002. These charges have resulted in savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs. The annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately $20.0 million. There were 163 severances related to these charges, the majority of which occurred in 2002. Of the remaining 2001 restructuring and other charges of $20.0 million, approximately $17.5 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spin off of Technologies with remaining charges of $2.5 million related to restructuring in Specialty Chemicals. The majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in 2001 and in the first half of 2002. The benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate reorganization and spin off are not subject to reasonable estimation. The benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company. There were approximately 45 severances related to these charges, the majority occurring in 2001. Net Interest expense in 2002 was $71.6 million compared to $58.3 million in 2001. The increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our 2002 refinancing. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results.) Provision/benefit for income taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of $17.4 million in 2002 compared to a benefit of $166.6 million in 2001 resulting in effective tax rates of 20 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The 2001 tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in 2001. The differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates, depletion, the impairment of certain assets, foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes. Discontinued Operations. We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $5.3 million ($3.3 million after tax) in 2002 for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. (See Environmental Obligations below and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for further details.) We recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $42.5 million ($30.5 million after tax) in 2001. Included in this amount are earnings of Technologies, including interest expense of $11.2 million, which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Statement No. 30 (APB 30) and later 37 relevant accounting guidance, costs related to the spin off and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of Technologies from FMC. In addition, we recorded a charge of $18.0 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses. Net income/loss. We recorded net income of $65.8 million in 2002 compared to a net loss of $337.7 million for 2001. This variance reflects $323.1 million of asset impairments and $280.4 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001. Net income in 2002 compared to 2001, excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges, was lower due to lower sales in Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals, somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring activities. Other Financial Data Capital Expenditures totaled $83.9 million in 2002 compared to $145.6 million in 2001. Lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential value creating projects. Also reducing capital expenditures was the lack of spending related to environmental assets at Pocatello. The need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of Pocatello. The following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K). Corporate expenses were $35.6 million in 2002 and $36.3 million in 2001. Corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other loss for the year was $0.4 million compared to a net other loss of $1.6 million in 2001. This variance is largely attributable to a LIFO reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses. Segment Results 2002 compared to 2001 Agricultural Products Year EndedDecember 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2002 2001 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 615.1 $ 653.1 $ (38.0 ) (6 )% Operating Profit 69.5 72.8 (3.3 ) (5 ) Herbicide sales decreased to $135.0 million in 2002 compared to $163.6 million in 2001 mainly due to a planned reduction in sulfentrazone sales, as we shifted our focus from soybeans to higher value crops, and poor weather conditions in North America. Insecticide sales were down slightly at $480.1 million in 2002 compared to $489.5 million in 2001 mostly due to weaker insecticide demand in Asia from drought conditions in Australia and channel inventory reductions, somewhat offset by the development of new labels and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in North America. A stronger demand and new applications in our non agricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in 2002. Lower herbicide sales and the absence of a $20.0 million profit protection payment from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) were more than offset by lower selling, administrative and research costs. In 1998, we entered into an exclusive agreement with DuPont to provide them sulfentrazone in North America for use in soybeans. However, the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations 38 and the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001. Therefore, DuPont no longer has the exclusive rights to the product in North America. Earnings also reflected Agricultural Products continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and realignment of our R&D resources to our core strengths in insecticides. Related to these refocusing efforts were restructuring charges in both 2002 and 2001. In 2002 we recorded $4.7 million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a $12.5 million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops. Restructuring charges are not included in the results of our business segments. See Restructuring and other charges under Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 for further details. Specialty Chemicals Year EndedDecember 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2002 2001 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 488.2 $ 472.0 $ 16.2 3 % Operating Profit 89.8 87.5 2.3 3 BioPolymer revenue increased to $355.2 million from $341.2 million in 2001 reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose, for its use in binders, and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the food ingredients market. Partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients. In lithium, revenue performance was $133.0 million in 2002 compared to $130.8 million in 2001. A stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of lithium salts to Japan, due to a weaker economy, and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2001. Higher earnings can be attributed to higher sales from overall BioPolymer growth, a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium, due largely to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, and the absence of a $4.2 million ($2.8 million after tax) charge from the required change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill. Specialty Chemicals goodwill was the direct result of BioPolymers 1999 acquisition of Pronova Biopolymer AS. Lithiums earnings were also favorably impacted by higher butyllithium sales. In addition, the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium, discussed above, delivered a high margin sale in 2001 that was not repeated in 2002. During 2002, our BioPolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial markets it serves, principally with its alginate product line. As a result, in 2002 we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs. We believe that this action will further focus BioPolymers commercial efforts on core, high value markets, including pharmaceutical formulation, food ingredients and personal care. Industrial Chemicals Year EndedDecember 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2002 2001 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 753.4 $ 822.0 $ (68.6 ) (8 )% Operating Profit 71.6 72.6 (1.0 ) (1 ) 39 Alkali revenue decreased to $368.0 million in 2002 from $402.5 million in 2001 due to lower overall volumes, lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter 2002 sale of our sodium cyanide business. A portion of the decline in soda ash revenues was attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash, which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they did in the first quarter of 2002. Furthermore, we experienced lower international sales volumes through ANSAC. Foret saw a decrease in revenue to $222.5 million in 2002 compared to $243.8 million in 2001, reflecting lower phosphate sales, due in part to the loss of a major European detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines. Somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at Foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro. Peroxygens revenue decreased to $162.9 million in 2002 from $175.7 million in 2001 due to generally lower selling prices and lower persulfate volumes, reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market. Increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in non pulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of 2002, somewhat offset lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes. Overall earnings levels of $71.6 million in 2002 compared to $72.6 in the prior year. Relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs, significant cost savings from our 2002 and 2001 restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at Pocatello. Reacting to market weakness in Industrial Chemicals in 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of $12.4 million to improve our cost position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our Granger caustic facility and Spring Hill, West Virginia hydrogen peroxide facility. During 2001 we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business. Total charges for 2001 included an impairment charge of $224.2 million and restructuring and other charges of $247.9 million. Segment earnings do not include these charges. Asset impairments and restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results. See Asset Impairments and Restructuring and other charges above and Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. The restructuring of our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals business in late 2001 has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus. Our U.S. based phosphorus chemicals businesss cost position has improved as its PPA sourcing has increased. The shutdown of Pocatello also allowed FMC to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in 2002 and avoid significant start up and certain on going operating costs for environmental compliance issues at the site. The restructuring activities in 2002 should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at Spring Hill. Lower joint venture earnings at Astaris and lower volumes and price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities. Lower earnings from Astaris were due to a 8 percent decrease in sales to $445.7 million in 2002 from $486.2 million in the prior year. A decreased benefit from the former power resale contract with Idaho Power and higher than expected startup costs at Astaris PPA plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs. The total resale power benefit to Astaris in 2002 was approximately $12 million compared to approximately $34 million in 2001. This benefit did not continue in 2003. Recently adopted accounting standards In December 2003 the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition (SAB No. 104) effective December 17, 2003. SAB 104 updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of SABs to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations related to revenue recognition. We believe our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 104. In December of 2003 we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 132 (revised), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (SFAS No. 132) as amended. This standard retains the existing disclosures and 40 requires additional disclosures to provide more detail about pension plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and related information. We have included the required disclosure in Note 12 in this Form 10 K. In May 2003, FASB issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150) which provides guidance on how an entity classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 effective July 1, 2003 did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 149), which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after September 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after September 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 effective July 1, 2003 did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, (SFAS No. 143) on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs by recording a liability at discounted fair value. The liability is then adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the assets useful life. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements following a review of our consolidated assets in light of SFAS No. 143. We will continue to review our assets for related retirement obligations and assess any possible future obligations that could arise through acquisitions, capital expenditures, changes in environmental law or changes in the business environment in which a particular business operates. We adopted SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, (SFAS No. 146), as amended, on January 1, 2003. This standard addresses the accounting and reporting for costs of so called exit activities (including restructuring) and for the disposal of long lived assets. The standard changes some of the criteria for recognizing a liability for these activities. We applied the provisions of SFAS No. 146 and other relevant accounting guidance to the restructuring activities recorded in 2003. The effect of the standard largely related to the timing of liability recognition during the year. In 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure An amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 (SFAS No. 148). This statement amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 but have determined that we will not make the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45) as amended by FASB Staff Positions (FSPs) FIN 45 1 and FIN 45 2. FIN 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantees. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosure about the guarantors obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We have included the required disclosure in Notes 16 and 18 in this Form 10 K. 41 In 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB No. 14, and Technical Corrections. The Statement rescinds or amends a number of existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify definitions, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. In 2002, with the retirement of our Meridian Gold debentures, we elected to adopt SFAS No. 145 early and recorded a $3.1 million loss ($1.9 million after tax) in 2002 related to the early retirement of these debentures in selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with the Statement. On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. For further discussion of the effect of this recently adopted standard see Goodwill and intangible assets above. On January 1, 2001, we implemented SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138 (collectively, the Statement). The Statement requires recognition of all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments to be recorded in current earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedging transaction and whether a derivative is designated as an effective hedge. New Accounting Standards In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) became law in the United States. The Medicare Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare benefit. In accordance with FASB Staff Position FAS 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we have elected to defer recognition of the effects of the Medicare Act in any measures of the benefit obligation or cost. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for federal subsidy is pending and that guidance, when issued, could require us to change previously reported information. The measurement date used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measures for the pension plan and the postretirement benefit plan is December 31. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R). During July 2003, the FASB issued several FSPs that have amended the original provisions of the Interpretation. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 which clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, for certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The Interpretation establishes standards under which a variable interest entity should be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. This standard is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Environmental Obligations Our company, like other industrial manufacturers, is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. We believe strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment, public health and employee safety. This responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes. When issues arise, including notices from the EPA or other government agencies identifying our company as a PRP, our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues. When necessary, we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental, legal, financial, and communications personnel to ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health, as well as to our employees and shareholders. 42 We provided environmental provisions totaling $24.9 million in 2003, of which $2.2 million related to operating sites and $22.7 million related to discontinued sites. We provided environmental provisions totaling $10.2 million in 2002. This included charges related to environmental sites of discontinued businesses and continuing operating sites. In 2001 we provided $68.8 million of environmental provisions related to operating and discontinued sites, of which $47.4 million was for additional remediation related to the shutdown of Pocatello. Additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 11, respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K. Estimates of 2004 environmental spending are included in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2003, we paid $163.6 million, including a premium of $0.3 million, plus accrued interest, to redeem all of the outstanding 6.375 percent senior notes due September 2003 and all of the 6.53 percent series B medium term notes due December 2003. The redemption of the notes was largely funded from Restricted cash, which was $136.9 million and $274.6 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Restricted cash shown on the consolidated balance sheets was set aside as a part of the 2002 financing transactions (discussed below) to provide substantial cash for collateral assuring the payment of certain self insurance obligations, environmental remediation activities, future business commitments, cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variable rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, and cash to redeem long term debt maturing before December 31, 2003. Among other restrictions, our Credit Facilities (which are described in detail in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements) contain financial covenants related to leverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt), interest coverage (measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings), consolidated net worth and capital spending. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. In October 2003, the Astaris affiliate began implementation of a restructuring plan and in connection with this plan, we expect to make additional payments recorded as capital contributions to Astaris of approximately $40 million in 2004 and to defer until September 2005 a total of approximately $30 million of payments anticipated from Astaris. In December 2003, to accommodate the financial effects on us of the Astaris restructuring plan, we were successful in achieving favorable amendments in our Credit Facilities. Among these amendments were favorable changes in the maximum leverage covenant (defined as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and the maintenance of net worth covenant. Along with the favorable covenant amendments, we obtained the agreement of the lenders under our Credit Facilities to reduce the applicable margin under the term loan facility by 2.25 percent per annum. We expect net interest expense in 2004 to be approximately $10 million below net interest expense in 2003 primarily from lower rates for borrowings under the term loan facility, lower outstanding total debt, and lower average cash balances. Under our Credit Facilities we had term loan facility borrowings of $247.5 million and $250.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $250.0 million revolving credit facility had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2003. Letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled $2.6 million at December 31, 2003, which together with the lack of outstanding borrowings, resulted in $247.4 million of remaining availability. There were no outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2002. Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 were $57.0 million and $89.6 million, respectively. The majority of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003, was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We had total debt of $1,050.2 million and $1,267.0 million at 43 December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This included $1,033.4 million and $1,035.9 million of long term debt (excluding current portions of $3.0 million and $166.8 million) at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Short term debt, which consists primarily of foreign borrowings, decreased to $13.8 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $64.3 million at December 31, 2002. The $166.3 million decrease in total long term debt at December 31, 2003 from December 31, 2002 was largely the result of the redemption and repayment of our 6.375 percent senior notes due September 2003 and 6.53 percent series B medium term notes due December 2003. In 2003, we paid $144.3 million, including a premium of $0.3 million, to redeem the entire outstanding balance of our 6.375 percent senior notes, plus accrued interest. In December 2003, we paid $20.0 million plus accrued interest to redeem at par all of the outstanding 6.53 percent series B medium term notes. Cash provided by operating activities was $194.6 million for 2003 compared to $136.2 million for 2002 and cash required by operating activities of $52.9 million in 2001, primarily reflecting improved working capital management. Also contributing to higher cash provided by operating activities during 2003 is lower restructuring spending of $19.3 million compared to $63.8 million in 2002 and $86.5 million in 2001. Included in our operating cash activities in 2002 is $63.8 million for spending on restructuring and other activities, including $32.3 million for the shutdown of Pocatello. In 2003 the spending against restructuring reserves related to the Pocatello shutdown was $6.0 million. Spending against restructuring reserves related to the Pocatello shutdown is expected to be approximately $35 million in 2004 and is then expected to drop significantly in 2005 through its completion. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased significantly in 2002 compared to 2001 reflecting lower business activity, including lower inventory, in 2002 than in 2001. Also in 2002, cash provided by operating activities improved as a result of collections of accounts receivable especially within Agricultural Products, particularly in Latin America. Because we are a global company with significant investment in the Euro zone, the 2003 increase in the Euro versus the U.S. dollar had a significant effect on the amounts of our operating assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheets. For better comparability, we exclude this effect in the section of the statement of cash flows entitled change in operating assets and liabilities. Cash required by discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $26.1 million, $29.6 million and $111.9 million, respectively. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses. Discontinued environmental spending was $21.7 million in 2003 compared to $16.8 million in 2002 and $23.3 million in 2001. Also contributing to the decline in 2003 was the absence of certain spending included in 2002 related to the spin off of Technologies. In the first quarter of 2001 we made an $80.0 million payment for the settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business. Cash required by investing activities was $157.8 million, $110.8 million and $169.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 reflects an increase in financing commitments to Astaris and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in 2003 compared to 2002. Cash contributions to Astaris were $62.8 million, $29.6 million and $31.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A planned reduction in capital spending in 2002 compared to 2001 contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities in 2002. Additionally, 2001 included approximately $43 million for spending on environmental remediation assets at Pocatello. Pocatello was shut down in the fourth quarter of 2001, which curtailed this spending. Cash required by financing activities for 2003 was $53.2 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $65.8 million for 2002 and $346.7 million in 2001. In 2003, we paid $163.6 million, including a premium of $0.3 million, to redeem the entire outstanding balance of our 6.375 percent senior notes due September 2003, plus accrued interest, and to redeem at par all of the outstanding 6.53 percent series B medium term notes. The redemption of these notes was funded with $144.3 million of restricted cash. Also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to 2002 was the completion of an equity offering in the second quarter of 2002 resulting in net proceeds of $101.3 million, which was not repeated in 2003. 44 Cash provided by financing activities for 2002 of $65.8 million decreased by $280.9 million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of $346.7 million in 2001. Our 2002 financing activities included a net increase in long term debt of $384.1 million from net proceeds of our refinancing of $595.5 million. Activity in 2002 also reflected $181.2 million paid to redeem long term debt, a $37.8 million decrease in our vendor financing program and $65.0 million paid to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program in October 2002. This program had an outstanding balance of $79.0 million at December 31, 2001. Our long term debt repayments in 2002 included payment of $134.9 million for scheduled maturities, the redemption of $17.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375 percent senior notes due September 2003 and several other minor maturities. In 2002, we also made payments of $32.5 million to redeem all outstanding 6.75 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures. Financing sources included $101.3 million, net of issuance costs, from the issuance of 3.25 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2002, which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former $240.0 million revolving credit facility, which was terminated upon the completion of our refinancing in October 2002. Our 2001 financing activities included $430.7 million from the IPO of Technologies, net of contributions to Technologies to support their operating cash needs. 2002 Financing Transactions During 2002, we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned business operations by completing a series of financing transactions. In June 2002, we issued 3.25 million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of $101.3 million to reduce amounts borrowed under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Following this offering, Moodys lowered its rating of our long term debt from Baa3 to Ba1. Moodys rating of Baa3 is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty long term debt ratings. Moodys also lowered its rating of our short term debt from P 3 to NP, the fourth level from the top of its five level short term debt ratings scale. Subsequent to these actions we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our $240.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. In October 2002, we completed a significant refinancing in which we issued $355.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25 percent senior secured notes due 2009. Simultaneously, we entered into a new $500.0 million senior secured credit agreement, which provided for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million term loan facility, and obtained a $40.0 million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility. Further details on the 2002 refinancing are found in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. Commitments and other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2004 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled maturities of long term debt, keepwell payments supporting Astaris as described below, environmental spending, and restructuring spending. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our $250.0 million committed revolving credit facility. In connection with the finalization of Astaris external financing arrangements during the third quarter of 2000, we entered into an agreement with Astaris lenders under which we agreed to make payments (keepwell payments) sufficient to make up one half of the shortfall in Astaris earnings below certain levels. Solutia, which owns the other 50 percent of Astaris, provided a parallel agreement under which it makes up the other half of any shortfall. Astaris earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2003, 2002 and 2001, and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2004. We made keepwell payments of $62.8 million under this arrangement in 2003 compared to keepwell payments of $29.6 million in 2002 and $31.3 million in 2001. We expect our total keepwell payments for 2004 depending on the financial performance of Astaris to be approximately $40 million. 45 Astaris credit facility and our agreement under which we make keepwell payments incorporate financial covenants contained in our principal credit facility, and Astaris credit facility contains customary default provisions related to our financial condition, results, and solvency. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Astaris lenders agreed to accept a bank letter of credit furnished on behalf of Solutia in the amount of $67 million in exchange for a release of a security interest held by the lenders in certain of Solutias assets and removal of Solutias financial covenants and solvency as grounds for default under Astaris credit facility. At December 31, 2003, Astaris credit facility obligations, which FMCs and Solutias keepwell payments are intended to support, included outstanding borrowings of $70.9 million and letters of credit of $9.2 million, compared to $167.9 million of outstanding borrowings and $9.1 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2002. We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. A significant portion of the customers obligations to repay us for any amounts paid under the guarantees is secured by liens on their crops. Past losses under this program have been minimal. Amounts recorded as guarantees of vendor financing for December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $44.3 million and $18.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2002, we also provided guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Product customers in Brazil to support their importation of third party agricultural products. These guarantees totaled $4.5 million at December 31, 2002. On June 30, 1999, we acquired the assets of Tg Soda Ash, Inc. from Elf Atochem North America, Inc. (Elf Atochem) for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end 2003 based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003. On December 31, 2003, we made the required contingent payment in the amount of $32.4 million, subject to a 90 day review period. We do not expect this review to result in any additional material payments. Projected 2004 spending also includes approximately $50 million of environmental remediation spending, of which approximately $20 million relates to Pocatello and $30 million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $12 million and $9 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $23 million to $22 million annually in 2004 and in 2005 for environmental compliance costs, which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves. Other commitments that could affect our liquidity include the following: We agreed to guarantee the performance by Technologies of certain obligations under several contracts, debt instruments, and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit. (See Note 2 and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K.) As of December 31, 2003, these guaranteed obligations totaled $6.8 million compared to $14.5 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there was $41.0 million principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by $43.3 million in bank letters of credit, which are fully collateralized with cash, which is a component of restricted cash as shown on the consolidated balance sheets of this Form 10 K. We provide parent company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. The outstanding amounts of guaranteed debt included in short term debt on our consolidated balance sheets of this Form 10 K were $13.8 million and $64.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and 2002. 46 Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows: Expected Cash Payments by Year Contractual Commitments 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 & beyond Total (in Millions) Short term debt $ 13.8 $ 13.8 Long term debt maturities (1) 3.0 63.3 3.4 292.5 682.5 1,044.7 Lease obligations (2) 27.5 26.4 19.5 15.8 90.7 179.9 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts (1.5 ) (0.2 ) (1.7 ) Astaris keepwells (3) 40.0 40.0 Total $ 82.8 $ 89.5 $ 22.9 $ 308.3 $ 773.2 $ 1,276.7 (1) Before discounts. (2) Before recoveries. (3) Astaris keepwell payments are based on our current estimate of keepwell payments likely to be paid in 2004. Dividends On November 29, 2001, our Board of Directors approved the spin off of the remaining 83 percent of Technologies making it an independent publicly traded company. The spin off qualified as a tax free distribution to U.S. stockholders. Stockholders of record as of December 31, 2001 received approximately 1.72 shares of common stock of the new company for every 1.0 share of our stock. Fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on December 31, 2001. We paid no cash dividends in 2003 or 2002 and we do not expect to pay dividends in 2004. We paid no cash dividends in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in currency, interest and exchange rates. To accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period. Market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. We calculate the market value foreign currency risk using third party software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (spot and forward foreign exchange rates) as of the valuation date. We obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party. At December 31, 2003 our net financial instrument position of interest rate swaps and currency and energy hedges was a net asset of $1.1 million compared to a net liability of $4.7 million at December 31, 2002. The change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized gains in our energy hedges. Commodity Price Risk Energy costs are approximately 9 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal, electricity and natural gas. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the 47 cost of natural gas. To analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. A 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of $9.0 million at December 31, 2003 and a decrease of $6.2 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at December 31, 2002. A 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of $8.5 million in the net asset position into a net liability position at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would have resulted in an increase of $4.3 million in the net liability position. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the euro versus the Norwegian krone, the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. To analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. A 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in an increase of $16.2 million and $12.8 million in the net liability position at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of $15.6 million and $11.6 million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest Rate Risk One of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. In the agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In the first quarter of 2003, we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of $100.0 million. These swaps, in which we exchange net amounts based on making payments derived from a floating rate index and receiving payments on a fixed rate basis, are used to hedge our 10.25 percent senior secured notes due 2009. Interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under SFAS No. 133 are accounted for as fair value hedges. The net position of these interest rate swap agreements is not material at December 31, 2003. All existing fair value hedges are 100 percent effective. As a result, there is no effect on earnings from hedge ineffectiveness. Our debt portfolio, including interest rate swap agreements, at December 31, 2003 is composed of 62 percent fixed rate debt and 38 percent variable rate debt compared to 72 percent fixed rate debt and 28 percent variable rate debt at December 31, 2002. The variable rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of bank borrowings, variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of 2003 with an aggregate notional principal amount of $100.0 million. Changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable rate debt portfolio in different ways. Based on the variable rate debt, including interest rate swap agreements, in our debt portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates in 2003 and 2002 would increase or decrease net income by $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively. 48
