Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The actual results of the future events described in such forward looking statements in the Annual Report could differ materially from those stated in such forward looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: general economic conditions, competition, government regulation, possible future litigation, acts of terrorism and acts of war as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report, including, without limitation, the portions referenced above, and the risks and uncertainties set forth on the Companys Current Report on Form 8 K dated March 30, 1999.  Industry Overview Watch Products The Company believes that the current market for watches in the United States can be divided into four segments. One segment of the market consists of fine watches characterized by internationally known brand names such as Concord, Piaget and Rolex. Watches offered in this segment are usually made of precious metals or stainless steel and may be set with precious gems. These watches are often manufactured in Switzerland and are sold by trade jewelers and in the fine jewelry departments of better department stores and other purveyors of luxury goods at retail prices ranging from $1,500 to in excess of $20,000. A second segment of the market consists of fine premium branded and designer watches manufactured in Switzerland and the Far East such as Gucci, Rado, Raymond Weil, Seiko and Swiss Army. These watches are sold at retail prices generally ranging from $150 to $1,500. The Companys EMPORIO ARMANI, ZODIAC&reg; and ANTIMA&reg; lines and, beginning in late 2002, BURBERRY line generally compete in this market segment. A third segment of the market consists of watches sold by mass marketers, which include certain watches sold under the Timex brand name as well as certain watches sold by Armitron under various brand names and labels. Retail prices in this segment range from $5 to $40. The fourth segment of the market consists of moderately priced watches characterized by contemporary fashion and well known brand names. Moderately priced watches are typically manufactured in Japan or Hong Kong and are sold by department stores and specialty stores at retail prices ranging from $40 to $150. This market segment is targeted by the Company and its principal competitors, including the companies that market watches under the Guess?, Anne Klein II, Kenneth Cole and Swatch brand names, whose products attempt to reflect emerging fashion trends in accessories and apparel. The Companys DKNY and DIESEL lines generally compete in this segment as well. Some of the watches in this sector are manufactured under license agreements with companies that market watches under various brand names, including Guess?, Anne Klein II and Kenneth Cole. The Company believes that one reason for the growth of this sector has been that fashion conscious consumers have increasingly come to regard branded fashion watches not only as time pieces but also as fashion accessories. This trend has resulted in consumers owning multiple watches that may differ significantly in terms of style, features and cost. 3 Fashion Accessories The Company believes that the fashion accessories market in the United States includes products such as small leather goods, handbags, belts, eyewear, neckwear, underwear, lounge wear, jewelry, gloves, hats, hosiery and socks. The Company believes that one reason for the growth in this line of business is that consumers are becoming more aware of accessories as fashion statements, and as a result, are purchasing brand name, quality items that complement other fashion items. These fashion accessory products are generally marketed through mass merchandisers, department stores and specialty shops, depending upon price and quality. Higher price point items include products offered by Coach, Dooney & Burke, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan New York. Moderately priced fashion accessories are typically marketed in department stores and are characterized by contemporary fashion and well known brand names at reasonable price points, such as FOSSIL and RELIC. The Company currently offers small leather goods, handbags, belts, and eyewear for both men and women through department stores and specialty retailers in the moderate to upper moderate price range. Companies such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Guess?, Nine West, Kenneth Cole and Liz Claiborne currently operate in this market. Apparel In 2000, the Company introduced a line of FOSSIL apparel that is distributed exclusively through Company owned retail stores and the Companys website. Selling through Company owned stores allows the Company to effectively manage visual presentation, information feedback, inventory levels and operating returns. The apparel line is focused on the casual lifestyle of 16 to 24 year old consumers and consists primarily of jeans, tee shirts, and sweatshirts featuring FOSSIL brand packaging and labeling. The suggested retail selling price of the apparel line is comparable to that of major competitors like American Eagle Outfitters and Gap. The Company has leveraged its existing graphic and store design infrastructure to create a unique product packaging and store concept that differentiates it from other competitors in order to create higher perceived value for the products.  Business Strategy The Companys long term goal is to capitalize on the strength of its growing consumer brand recognition and capture an increasing share of a growing number of markets by providing consumers with fashionable, high quality, value driven products. In pursuit of this goal, the Company has adopted operating and growth strategies that provide the framework for the Companys future growth, while maintaining the consistency and integrity of its brands.  Operating Strategy Fashion Orientation and Design Innovation. The Company is able to market its products to consumers with differing tastes and lifestyles by offering a wide range of brands and product categories at a variety of price points. The Company attempts to stay abreast of emerging fashion and lifestyle trends affecting accessories and apparel and it responds to these trends by making adjustments in its product lines several times each year. The Company differentiates its products from those of its competitors principally through innovations in fashion details, including variations in the treatment of dials, crystals, cases, straps and bracelets for the Companys watches, innovative treatments and details in its other accessories. 4 Coordinated Product Promotion. The Company coordinates in house product design, packaging, advertising and in store presentations to more effectively and cohesively communicate to its target markets the themes and images associated with its brands. For example, many of the Companys FOSSIL brand products and certain of its accessory products are packaged in metal tins decorated with designs consistent with the Companys marketing strategy and product image. In addition, the Company generally markets its fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as its watch lines, using similar in store presentations, graphics and packaging. Product Value. The Companys products provide value to the consumer by offering fashionable, high quality components and features at suggested retail prices generally below those of competitive products of comparable quality. The Company is able to offer its watches at a reasonable price point by manufacturing them principally in the Far East at lower cost than comparable quality watches manufactured in Switzerland. In addition, the Company is able to offer its accessories at reasonable prices because of its close relationships with manufacturers in the Far East. Unlike certain of its principal competitors, the Company does not pay royalties on its flagship brand, which the Company believes allows it to enjoy certain cost advantages that enhance its ability to achieve attractive profit margins. Captive Suppliers. The Company owns a majority interest in a number of watch assemblers with locations in Hong Kong and China. In addition, the Company maintains close relationships with accessory manufacturers in the Far East. The Company believes these relationships create a significant competitive advantage as they allow the Company to produce quality products, reduce the delivery time to market and improve overall operating margins. Actively Manage Retail Sales. The Company manages the retail sales process by monitoring customer sales and inventory levels by product category and style, primarily through Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI"), and by assisting retailers in the conception, development and implementation of their marketing programs. As a result, the Company believes it enjoys close relationships with its principal retailers, often allowing it to influence the mix, quantity and timing of customer purchasing decisions. Centralized Distribution. The Company distributes substantially all of its products sold in the United States and certain of its products sold in international markets from its warehouse and distribution centers in Richardson, Texas. The Company also distributes its products to international markets from warehouse and distribution centers located in Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, Australia, France and the United Kingdom. The Company believes its centralized distribution capabilities enable it to reduce inventory risk, increase flexibility in meeting the delivery requirements of its customers and maintain significant cost advantages as compared to its competitors.  Growth Strategy Introduce New Products and Brands. The Company continually introduces new products within its existing brands and through license agreements and brand extensions to attract a wide range of consumers with differing tastes and lifestyles. For example, the Company currently offers a full line of fashion watch and accessory products under its FOSSIL and RELIC brands, as well as watches under the EMPORIO ARMANI, DKNY, DIESEL and, beginning in late 2002, BURBERRY brand names pursuant to license agreements. In addition, the Company aquired three separate companies located in Bienne, Switzerland to provide the Company with design, sourcing and production 5 capabilities necessary to manufacture and market Swiss made watches. The Company also leverages its brand recognition and its design and marketing expertise to expand the scope of its product offerings through the selective licensing of new product categories that complement its existing products. For example, the Company entered into license agreements with Safilo Group to offer FOSSIL and RELIC optical frames in the United States and Canada. Expand International Business. The Company has increased FOSSIL brand advertising internationally to accelerate brand recognition. The Company has also purchased former distributors and entered into joint venture relationships to gain increased control over the brand and instilled global wide marketing efforts. The Company continues to introduce its licensed brand products into international markets, open FOSSIL stores and develop new product lines. Leverage Infrastructure. The Company believes it has the design, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure in place to allow it to manage and grow its businesses. The Company continues to develop additional products and brands and seeks additional businesses and products to complement its existing business allowing it to leverage its existing infrastructure. Expand Retail Locations. The Company has historically expanded its Company owned FOSSIL retail and outlet locations to further strengthen its brand image. The Company currently operates 89 retail and outlet stores and plans to open an additional three to five accessory stores and three to five outlet stores in 2002 in the United States. The Company intends to continue to offer its watch and accessory products through additional independently owned, authorized FOSSIL retail stores in airports, on cruise ships and in international markets.  Products The Company designs, develops, markets and distributes fashion watches and accessories, including sunglasses, small leather goods, belts, jewelry and handbags, principally under the FOSSIL and RELIC brand names and FOSSIL brand apparel and watches bearing the brand names of certain internationally known fashion designers pursuant to license agreements. Watch Products The Company introduced FOSSIL watches, its flagship product, in 1986 and RELIC watches in 1990. Since 1986, the Company has also contracted with retailers and other customers for the manufacture of watches primarily for sale under private labels. Sales of the Companys watches for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 accounted for approximately 68.1%, 71.7%, and 76.5%, respectively, of the Companys net sales.

The Company designs, markets and arranges for the manufacture of watches on behalf of certain retailers, entertainment companies, theme restaurants and other corporate customers such as Eddie Bauer and Disney, as private label products or as premium and incentive items for use in various corporate events. Under this arrangement, the Company performs design and product development functions as well as acts as a sourcing agent for its customers by contracting for the manufacture of watches, managing the manufacturing process, inspecting the finished watches, 7 purchasing the watches and arranging for their shipment to the United States. Participation in the private label and premium businesses provides the Company with certain advantages, including increased manufacturing volume, which may reduce the costs of manufacturing the Companys other watch products, and the strengthening of business relationships with its manufacturing sources. These lines provide income to the Company with reduced inventory risks and certain other carrying costs. The Company has also entered into a number of license agreements for the sale of collectible watches. Under these agreements, the Company designs, manufactures and markets the goods bearing the trademarks, trade names and logos of various entities through major department stores within the Companys channels of distribution, including Harry Potter, Batman, Superman and Star Wars. Fashion Accessories In order to leverage the Companys design and marketing expertise and its close relationships with its principal retail customers, the Company has developed a line of fashion accessories, including handbags, and mens and womens belts, small leather goods and sunglasses. The Company has also introduced a line of FOSSIL brand fashion jewelry in Germany and is test marketing the line in other countries, including the United States. The Companys handbags are made of a variety of fine leathers and other materials that emphasize classic styles and incorporate a variety of creative designs. The sunglass line features optical quality lenses in both plastic and metal frames, with classic and fashion styling similar to other FOSSIL products. The Companys small leather goods are made of fine leathers and include items such as mini bags, coin purses, key chains and wallets. The Company currently sells its fashion accessories through a number of its existing major department store and specialty retail store customers. The Company generally markets its fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as its watch business, using similar in store presentations, graphics and packaging. These fashion accessories are typically sold in locations adjacent to watch departments, which may lead to purchases by persons who are familiar with the Companys watches. Sales of the Companys accessory lines for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 accounted for approximately 25.7%, 24.1% and 22.5%, respectively, of the Companys net sales.

The jeans wear collection is designed for both men and women. The products unique retro Americana packaging captures the energy and spirit of the FOSSIL brand. The FOSSIL apparel collection is offered through approximately 19 Company owned stores located in leading malls and retail locations in the United States. The line is also available at the Companys web site, www.fossil.com.

In order to complement the Companys existing line of products and to increase consumer awareness of the FOSSIL brand, the Company has entered into license agreements for other categories of fashion accessories. These license agreements provide for royalty income to the Company based on a percentage of net sales and are subject to certain guaranteed minimum royalties. In 1999 the Company entered into a multi year license agreement with the Safilo Group for the manufacture, marketing and sale of optical frames under the FOSSIL and RELIC brands in the United States and Canada. The Company also entered into a multi year license agreement for the manufacture, marketing and sale of certain handbags, backpacks and sports bags in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and The Netherlands under the FOSSIL brand. Future Products. The Company continually evaluates opportunities to expand its product offerings in the future to include other lines that would complement its existing product. 9  Design and Development The Companys watch, accessory and apparel products are created and developed by its in house design staff in cooperation with various outside sources, including manufacturing sources and component suppliers. Product design ideas are drawn from various sources and are reviewed and modified by the design staff to ensure consistency with the Companys existing product offerings and the themes and images that it associates with its products. Senior management is actively involved in the design process. In order to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences, the Company attempts to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends affecting accessories and apparel. In addition, the Company attempts to take advantage of the constant flow of information from the Companys customers regarding the retail performance of its products. The Company reviews weekly sales reports provided by a substantial number of the Companys customers containing information with respect to sales and inventories by product category and style. Once a trend in the retail performance of a product category or style has been identified, the design and marketing staffs review their product design decisions to ensure that key features of successful products are incorporated into future designs. Other factors having an influence on the design process include the availability of components, the capabilities of the factories that will manufacture the products and the anticipated retail prices and profit margins for the products. The Company differentiates its products from those of its competitors principally by incorporating into its product designs innovations in fashion details, including variations in the treatment of dials, crystals, cases, straps and bracelets for the Companys watches, and details and treatments in its other accessories. In certain instances, the Company believes that such innovations have allowed it to achieve significant improvements in consumer acceptance of its product offerings with only nominal increases in manufacturing costs. The Company believes that the substantial experience of its design staff will assist it in maintaining its current leadership position in watch design and in expanding the scope of its product offerings.  Marketing and Promotion The Companys current FOSSIL brand advertising themes aim at evoking nostalgia for the simpler values and more optimistic outlook of the 1950s through the use of images of cars, trains, airliners and consumer products that reflect the classic American tastes of the period. These images are carefully coordinated in order to convey the flair for fun, fashion and humor that the Company associates with its products. The Companys nostalgic "America in the 1950s" tin packaging concept for many of its watch products and certain of its accessories is an example of these marketing themes. The tins have become a signature piece to the FOSSIL image and have become popular with collectors. The Company participates in cooperative advertising programs with its major retail customers, whereby it shares the cost of certain of their advertising and promotional expenses. An important aspect of the marketing process involves the use of in store visual support and other merchandising materials, including packages, signs, posters and fixtures. Through the use of these materials, the Company attempts to differentiate the space used to sell its products from other areas of its customers stores. The Company also promotes the use of its Shop in Shop concept for handbags and small leather goods. The Shop in Shop concept involves the use of dedicated space within a customers store to create a FOSSIL "shop" featuring the Companys products and visual displays. The Company also provides its customers with a large number of preprinted, customized advertising inserts and from time to time stages promotional events designed to focus public attention on its products. 10 The Companys in house advertising department designs, develops and implements all aspects of the packaging, advertising, marketing and sales promotion of the Companys products. The advertising staff uses computer aided design techniques to generate the images presented on product packaging and other advertising materials. The Company believes that the use of computers encourages greater creativity and reduces the time and cost required to incorporate new themes and ideas into effective product packaging and other advertising materials. Senior management is involved in monitoring the Companys advertising and promotional activities to ensure that themes and ideas are communicated in a cohesive manner to the Companys target audience. The Company advertises, markets and promotes its products to consumers through a variety of media, including catalog inserts, billboards, print media and the Internet. The Company has advertised from time to time with billboards and other outdoor advertisements including bus panels in major metropolitan areas. The Company periodically advertises the RELIC brand in certain national fashion and consumer magazines such as Teen, Twist, MH18 and Marie Claire. The Company also periodically advertises in trade publications such as Womens Wear Daily and Daily News Record.  Sales and Customers The Company sells its products in approximately 17,000 retail locations in the United States through a diversified distribution network that includes approximately 5,000 department store doors, such as Federated/Macys, May Department Stores, Dillards, and approximately 12,500 specialty retail locations for its FOSSIL brand and JCPenney, Kohls and Sears for its RELIC brand. The Company also sells its watch and accessory products at Company owned FOSSIL retail stores located at retail sites in the United States and sells certain of its products at Company owned FOSSIL outlet stores located at major outlet malls throughout the United States. The Companys apparel products are sold through FOSSIL jeans wear stores and through the Companys website. The Company also sells its products at retail locations in major airports in the United States, on cruise ships and in independently owned, authorized FOSSIL retail stores and kiosks in certain international markets. The Company generally does not have long term contracts with any of its retail customers. All transactions between the Company and its retail customers are conducted on the basis of purchase orders, which generally require payment of amounts due to the Company on a net 30 day basis. Department Stores. For fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, domestic department stores accounted for approximately 53.3%, 59.8%, and 58.8% of the Companys net sales, respectively. In addition, in the same periods, the Companys 10 largest customers represented approximately 39%, 40%, and 41% of net sales, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys net sales in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999. Certain of the Companys customers are under common ownership. No customer, when considered as a group under common ownership, accounted for more than 10% of the Companys net sales in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999. International Sales. The Companys products are sold to department stores and specialty retail stores in over 90 countries worldwide through Company owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 51 independent distributors. The Companys foreign operations include a presence in Europe, South and Central America, the Caribbean, Canada, the Far East, Australia and the Middle East. Foreign distributors generally purchase products at uniform prices established by the Company for all international sales and resell them to department stores and specialty retail stores. The Company generally receives payment from its foreign distributors in United States currency. During the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, international and export sales accounted for approximately 34.5%, 30%, and 31% of net sales, respectively. 11  Company Owned FOSSIL Stores. In 1995, the Company commenced operations of FOSSIL outlet stores at selected major outlet malls throughout the United States. The Company operated 44 outlet stores at the end of fiscal year 2001. These stores, which operate under the FOSSIL name, enable the Company to liquidate excess inventory and increase brand awareness. The Companys products in such stores are generally sold at discounts from 25% to 75% off the suggested retail price. The Company intends to open three to five additional outlet stores in 2002. In 1996, the Company commenced operations of full priced accessory FOSSIL retail stores at some of the most prestigious retail malls and entertainment parks in the United States in order to broaden the recognition of the FOSSIL brand name. The Company currently operates 20 accessory retail stores in leading malls and retail locations throughout the United States, two in the United Kingdom and four in Australia. These stores, which operate under the FOSSIL name, carry a full assortment of FOSSIL merchandise which is generally sold at the suggested retail price. The Company intends to open three to five additional retail stores in 2002. In 2000, the Company began offering FOSSIL brand apparel through specially designed Company owned apparel stores. The Company currently operates 19 FOSSIL jeans wear stores in leading malls and retail locations throughout the United States. The Companys apparel stores carry the full apparel line along with an assortment of certain FOSSIL watch and accessory products. The Company does not intend to open any additional apparel stores in 2002. During the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, Company owned FOSSIL Store sales accounted for approximately 12%, 10%, and 9% of net sales, respectively. Internet Sales. In November 1996, the Company established a website at www.fossil.com. In September 1999, the Companys website was redesigned with a stronger emphasis on retail sales and order fulfillment. The Company offers selected FOSSIL brand watches, sunglassses, leather goods, apparel and other related products. These products are also available to consumers through "storefronts" on America Online, Microsoft Network and Yahoo that are connected to the Companys website. In addition to offering selected FOSSIL products, the Company also provides Company news and information on the website. During 2000, the Company launched a business to business site that allows the Companys specialty retail accounts access to real time inventory, account information and automated order processing. Sales Personnel. The Company utilizes an in house sales staff and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives to promote the sale of the Companys products to retail accounts. As of the end of fiscal year 2001, the Company had 123 in house sales and customer service employees and 25 independent sales representatives. The Companys in house sales personnel receive a salary and, in some cases, a commission based on a percentage of gross sales attributable to specified accounts. Independent sales representatives generally do not sell competing product lines and are under contracts with the Company that are generally terminable by either party upon 30 days prior notice. These independent contractors are compensated on a commission basis. Customer Service. The Company has developed an approach to managing the retail sales process that involves monitoring its customers sales and inventories by product category and style, primarily through EDI, and assisting in the conception, development and implementation of their marketing programs. For example, the Company reviews weekly selling reports prepared by certain of its principal customers and has established an active EDI program with certain of its customers. The Company also places significant emphasis on the establishment of cooperative advertising programs with its major retail customers. The Company believes that its management of the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with its principal customers, often allowing it to influence the mix, quantity and timing of their purchasing decisions. 12 The Company believes that its sales approach achieves high retail turnover in its products, which can result in attractive profit margins for its retail customers. The Company believes that the resulting profit margins for its retail customers encourage them to devote greater selling space to its products within their stores and enable the Company to work closely with buyers in determining the mix of products any store should carry. In addition, the Company believes that the buyers familiarity with the Companys sales approach has and should continue to facilitate the introduction of new products through its existing distribution network. The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although it has no obligation to do so, the Company accepts limited amounts of product returns from its customers in certain other instances. Accordingly, the Company provides allowances for the estimated amount of product returns. The allowances for product returns as of the end of fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $22.5 million, $21.2 million, and $17.7 million respectively. Since 1990, the Company has not experienced any returns in excess of the aggregate allowances therefor.  Backlog It is the practice of a substantial number of the Companys customers not to confirm orders by delivering a formal purchase order until a relatively short time prior to the shipment of goods. As a result, the amount of unfilled customer orders includes confirmed orders and orders that the Company believes will be confirmed by delivery of a formal purchase order. A majority of such amounts represent orders that have been confirmed. The remainder of such amounts represent orders that the Company believes, based on industry practice and prior experience, will be confirmed in the ordinary course of business. The Companys backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality and the scheduling of the manufacture and shipment of products. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments. For fiscal year 2001, the Company had unfilled customer orders of approximately $57.4 million compared to $63.5 million and $41.4 million for fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Manufacturing The Companys products are manufactured to its specifications by independent contractors and by companies in which the Company holds a majority interest. Substantially all of the Companys watches are manufactured by approximately 39 factories located primarily in Hong Kong and China. The Company believes that its policy of outsourcing products allows it to achieve increased production flexibility while avoiding significant capital expenditures, build ups of work in process inventory and the costs of managing a substantial production work force. The principal components used in the manufacture of the Companys watches are cases, crystals, dials, movements, bracelets and straps. These components are obtained by the Companys manufacturing sources from a large number of suppliers located principally in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Taiwan, Italy, Thailand and Korea. The Company estimates that the majority of the movements used in the manufacture of the Companys watches are supplied by three principal vendors. No other single component supplier accounted for more than 10% of component supplies in 2001. Although the Company does not normally engage in direct transactions with component suppliers, in some cases it actively reviews the performance of such suppliers and makes recommendations to its manufacturing sources regarding the sourcing of components. The Company does not believe that its business is materially dependent on any single component supplier. 13 The Company believes that it has established and maintains close relationships with a number of watch manufacturers located in Hong Kong and China. In 2001, four separate watch manufacturers in which the Company holds a majority interest each accounted for 10% or more of the Companys watch supplies. The loss of any one of these manufacturers could temporarily disrupt shipments of certain of the Companys watches. However, as a result of the number of suppliers from which the Company purchases its watches, the Company believes that it could arrange for the shipment of goods from alternative sources within approximately 30 days on terms that are not materially different from those currently available to the Company. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that the loss of any single supplier would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. In general, however, the future success of the Company will depend upon its ability to maintain close relationships with, or ownership of, its current suppliers and to develop long term relationships with other suppliers that satisfy the Companys requirements for price and production flexibility. The Companys products are manufactured according to plans that reflect managements estimates of product performance based on recent sales results, current economic conditions and prior experience with manufacturing sources. The average lead time from the commitment to purchase products through the production and shipment thereof ranges from two to three months in the case of watches, from three to six months in the case of sunglasses, from three to four months in the case of leather goods and from two to four months for apparel items. The Company believes that the close relationships and, in certain cases, ownership interest, that it has established and maintains with its principal manufacturing sources constitute a significant competitive advantage and allow it to quickly and efficiently introduce innovative product designs and alter production in response to the retail performance of its products.  Quality Control The Companys quality control program attempts to ensure that its products meet the standards established by its design staff. Samples of products are inspected by the Company prior to the placement of orders with manufacturing sources to ensure compliance with its specifications. The operations of the Companys manufacturing sources located in Hong Kong are monitored on a periodic basis by Fossil (East). Substantially all of the Companys watches and certain of its other accessories are inspected by personnel of Fossil (East) or by the manufacturer prior to shipment to the Company. In addition, the Company performs quality control checks on its products upon receipt at the Companys facility.  Distribution Upon completion of manufacturing, the Companys products are shipped to its warehousing and distribution centers in Richardson, Texas; Italy; Hong Kong; the United Kingdom; Germany; Australia and France from which they are shipped to customers in selected markets. Since July 1997, the Company has owned and operated a warehouse and distribution facility in Richardson, Texas, adjacent to the Companys headquarters, to maximize the Companys inventory management and distribution capabilities. The Company also leases a warehouse and distribution center in Garland, Texas. The Company has acquired a 517,500 square foot warehouse and distribution facility in Dallas, Texas that will allow it to centralize the facilities currently being utilized for such purposes. The Company anticipates that its domestic distribution operations will be consolidated into the new facility by mid year 2002. The Companys warehouse and distribution facilities in Richardson and Dallas, Texas are operated in a special purpose subzone established by the United States Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. As a result of the establishment of the subzone, the Company enjoys the following economic and operational advantages: (i) the Company may not have to pay duty on imported merchandise until it leaves the subzone and enters the United States market, (ii) the Company does not pay any United States duty on 14 merchandise if the imported merchandise is subsequently re exported, and (iii) the Company does not pay local property tax on inventory located within the subzone.  Management Information Systems Inventory Control. The Company maintains inventory control systems at its facilities that enable it to track each item of merchandise from receipt from its manufacturing sources, through shipment to its customers. To facilitate this tracking, a significant number of products sold by the Company are pre ticketed and bar coded prior to shipment to its retail customers. The Companys inventory control systems report shipping, sales and individual SKU level inventory information. The Company manages the retail sales process by monitoring customer sales and inventory levels by product category and style, primarily through EDI. The Company believes that its distribution capabilities enable it to reduce inventory risk and increase flexibility in responding to the delivery requirements of its customers. The Companys management believes that its EDI efforts will continue to grow in the future as customers focus further on increasing operating efficiencies. In addition, the Company maintains systems that are designed to track inventory movement through the FOSSIL retail and outlet stores. Detailed sales transaction records are accumulated on each stores point of sale system and polled nightly by the Company.  Warranty and Repair The Companys FOSSIL watch products are covered by a limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for a period of 11 years from the date of purchase. The Companys RELIC watch products are covered by a comparable 12 year warranty. The Companys licensed watch products generally are covered by one year limited warranty. The Companys sunglass line is covered by a one year limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship. Defective products returned by consumers are processed at the Companys warehousing and distribution centers. In most cases, defective products under warranty are repaired by the Companys personnel. Products under warranty that cannot be repaired in a cost effective manner are replaced by the Company at no cost to the customer. The Company also performs watch repair services on behalf of certain of its private label customers.  Governmental Regulations Imports and Import Restrictions. Most of the Companys products are manufactured overseas. As a result, the United States and the countries in which the Companys products are manufactured or sold may from time to time modify existing or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions in a manner that adversely affects the Company. For example, the Companys products imported to the United States are subject to United States customs duties and, in the ordinary course of its business, the Company may from time to time be subject to claims by the United States Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors which may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the United States Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to United States firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the United States and a country that leads to withdrawal of "most favored nation" status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the government of the United States. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, these events would have on its operations, especially in light of the concentration of its manufacturing operations in Hong Kong and China. General. The Companys sunglass products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration as medical devices. The Company does not believe that compliance with such regulations is material to its operations. In addition, the Company is subject to various state and federal regulations generally applicable to similar businesses. 15  Intellectual Property Trademarks. The Company has registered the FOSSIL and RELIC trademarks for use on the Companys watches, leather goods, apparel and other fashion accessories. The Company has also registered or applied for the registration of certain other marks used by the Company in conjunction with the sale and marketing of its products and services, including ZODIAC&reg; and ANTIMA&reg;. In addition, the Company has registered certain of its trademarks, including FOSSIL and RELIC, in certain foreign countries, including a number of countries located in Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, South America and Central America. The Company also has certain trade dress rights in, and has registered, the distinctive rectangular tins in which the Company packages certain of its FOSSIL watch products. Patents. The Company continues to explore innovations in the design and manufacture of its watch products and is involved in the development of technology enhanced watches. As a result, the Company has been granted, and has pending, various United States and international design and utility patents related to certain of its watch designs and features. The Company also has been granted, and has pending, various United States patents related to certain of its other products and technologies. The Company regards its trademarks, trade dress and patents as valuable assets and believes that they have significant value in the marketing of its products. The Company intends to protect its intellectual property rights vigorously against infringement.  Competition There is intense competition in each of the businesses in which the Company competes. The Companys watch business competes with a number of established manufacturers, importers and distributors such as Guess? Anne Klein II, Kenneth Cole and Swatch. In addition, the Companys leather goods, sunglass and apparel businesses compete with a large number of established companies that have significantly greater experience than the Company in designing, developing, marketing and distributing such products. In all of its businesses, the Company competes with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors who have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than the Company. The Companys competitors include distributors that import watches, accessories and apparel from abroad, domestic companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories and apparel domestically. The Company competes primarily on the basis of style, price, value, quality, brand name, advertising, marketing and distribution. In addition, the Company believes that its ability to identify and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, to maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with manufacturing sources, to deliver quality merchandise in a timely manner and to manage the retail sales process are important factors in its ability to compete. The Company considers that the risk of significant new competitors is mitigated to some extent by barriers to entry such as high startup costs and the development of long term relationships with customers and manufacturing sources. During the past few years, it has been the Companys experience that better department stores and other major retailers have been increasingly unwilling to source products from suppliers who are not well capitalized or do not have a demonstrated ability to deliver quality merchandise in a timely manner. There can be no assurance, however, that significant new competitors will not emerge in the future. 16  Employees As of the end of fiscal year 2001, the Company (excluding Arrow Merchandising, Inc. and the Companys foreign subsidiaries) had 2,389 employees, including 274 in executive or managerial positions and the balance in design, advertising, sales, quality control, distribution, clerical and other office positions.
