Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The words may, believes, expects, plans, intends, anticipates and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. The actual results of the future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from those stated in such forward looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including those discussed below. Accordingly, readers of this Annual Report on Form 10 K should consider these factors in evaluating, and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on, the forward looking statements contained herein. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business The deterioration in the global economic environment, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have an adverse effect on our operating results. The global economic environment has been challenging during the past two years. Declining real estate values, reduced lending by banks, solvency concerns of major financial institutions, increases in unemployment 23 Table of Contents levels and significant volatility in the global financial markets have negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This has affected our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. In certain countries in which we distribute our products, we experienced a significant slowdown in customer traffic and a highly promotional environment during late 2008 and most of 2009. Although we have experienced a slight improvement in the overall economy over the last twelve months, if the economy deteriorates or slides back into a recession, there could likely be a negative effect on our revenues and earnings across most of our segments for fiscal year 2011. The effects of economic cycles, terrorism, acts of war and retail industry conditions may adversely affect our business. Our business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war and military action both in the U.S. and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to procure our products from manufacturers for sale to our customers. Any significant declines in general economic conditions, public safety concerns or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on consumer purchases of our products. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image, marketing programs and product design. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences in a timely manner while preserving the authenticity and the quality of our brands. Although we attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends affecting accessories and clothing, any failure by us to identify and respond to such trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our existing brand names and product lines, which in turn could adversely affect sales of our products. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The loss of any of our license agreements, pursuant to which a number of our products are produced, may result in the loss of significant revenues and may adversely affect our business. A significant portion of our growth in sales and net income is, and is expected to continue to be, derived from the sales of products produced under license agreements with third parties. Under these license agreements, we generally have the right to produce, market and distribute certain products utilizing the brand names of other companies. We sell products under certain licensed brands, including, but not limited to, ADIDAS, BURBERRY, DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, MARC BY MARC JACOBS and MICHAEL KORS. Sales of our licensed products amounted to 39.4% of our net sales for fiscal year 2010, with certain individual licensed brands accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. Our material license agreements have various expiration dates between 2012 and 2015. In addition, certain license agreements may require us to make minimum royalty payments, subject us to restrictive covenants or require us to comply with certain other obligations and may be terminated by the licensor if these or other conditions are not met or upon certain events. We may not be able to continue to meet our obligations or fulfill the conditions under these agreements in the future. In addition, we may be unable to renew our existing license agreements beyond the current term or obtain new license agreements to replace any lost license agreements on similar economic terms or at all. The failure by us to maintain or renew one or more of our existing material license agreements could result in a significant decrease in our sales and have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. 24 Table of Contents Our success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products. Our success also depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products in the respective markets in which we compete. If we are unable to successfully introduce new products, or if our competitors introduce superior products, customers may purchase increasing amounts of products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. Reduced lending by banks could have a negative impact on our customers, suppliers and business partners, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The reduction in lending by banks is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. Although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our U.S. credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future, the impact of reduced lending on our customers, business partners and suppliers cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. The inability of our manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet delivery date requirements. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers, distributors or licensees to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and liquidity. Seasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal cycles, the timing of new product introductions, the timing of orders by our customers and the mix of product sales demand. Our business is seasonal by nature. A significant portion of our net sales and operating income are generated during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which includes the back to school and Christmas seasons. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the fourth quarter depends upon the anticipated level of retail sales during the Christmas season, as well as, general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In addition, the amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter depends in part upon the actual level of retail sales during the Christmas season. The seasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Our plan to significantly increase our store base may not be successful, and implementation of this plan may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could impact our competitive position. Each year, we have historically expanded our store base. During fiscal year 2011, we intend to further expand our store base by opening approximately 80 to 85 new stores globally and close approximately 26 to 28 stores. Thereafter, in the near term, we plan to continue to expand our store base annually. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to open new stores and renew our existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to open new stores on schedule or at all, to renew existing store leases on favorable terms or to operate them on a profitable basis will depend on various factors, including our ability to: identify suitable markets for new stores and available store locations; negotiate acceptable lease terms for new locations or renewal terms for existing locations; manage and expand our infrastructure to accommodate growth; hire and train qualified sales associates; develop new merchandise and manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis; foster current relationships and develop new relationships with vendors that are capable of supplying a greater volume of merchandise; and avoid construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build out of new stores. 25 Table of Contents Our plans to expand our store base may not be successful and the implementation of these plans may not result in an increase in our net sales even though they increase our costs. Additionally, implementing our plans to expand our store base will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. The increased demands of operating additional stores could cause us to operate less effectively, which could cause the performance of our existing stores and our wholesale operations to suffer materially. Any of these outcomes of our attempted expansion of our store base could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our financial condition and results of operations. We have key facilities in the U.S. and overseas, the loss or shut down of any of which could harm our business. Our administrative and distribution operations in the U.S. are conducted primarily from five separate facilities located in the Dallas, Texas area. Our operations internationally are conducted from various administrative, distribution and assembly facilities outside of the U.S., particularly in China, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland. The complete or temporary loss of use of all or part of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of our warehouse and distribution facilities in the Dallas, Texas area are operated in a special purpose sub zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. Although the sub zone allows us certain tax advantages, the sub zone is highly regulated by the U.S. Customs Service. This level of regulation may cause disruptions or delays in the distribution of our products out of these facilities. Under some circumstances, the U.S. Customs Service has the right to shut down the entire sub zone and, therefore, our entire warehouse and distribution facilities. During the time that the sub zone is shut down, we may be unable to adequately meet the supply requests of our customers and our Company owned retail stores, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, relationships with our customers, and results of operations, especially if the shut down were to occur during our third or fourth quarter. Our ability to grow our sales is dependent upon the implementation of our growth strategy, which we may not be able to achieve. Since our public offering in 1993, we have experienced substantial growth in net sales. Our ability to continue this growth is dependent on the successful implementation of our business strategy. This includes diversification of our product offerings, expansion of our Company owned accessory locations and possibly strategic acquisitions. If we are not successful in the expansion of our product offerings or our new products are not profitable or do not generate sales comparable to those of our existing businesses, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Another element of our business strategy is to place increased emphasis on growth in selected international markets. If our brand names and products do not achieve a high degree of consumer acceptance in these markets, our net sales could be adversely affected. We also operate FOSSIL brand stores and other non FOSSIL branded stores and have historically expanded our Company owned accessory and outlet locations to further strengthen our brand image. As of January 1, 2011, we operated 364 stores worldwide. The costs associated with leasehold improvements to current stores and the costs associated with opening new stores could materially increase our costs of operation. We have recently expanded and intend to further expand the scope of our product offerings, and new products introduced by us may not achieve consumer acceptance comparable to that of our existing product lines. We have recently expanded and intend to further expand the scope of our product offerings. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer 26 Table of Contents acceptance can be measured. If trends shift away from our products, or if we misjudge the market for our product lines, we may be faced with significant amounts of unsold inventory or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The failure of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance could also adversely affect our business and the image of our brands. Achieving market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to generate consumer demand. These requirements could strain our management, financial and operational resources. If we do not continue to develop innovative products that provide better design and performance attributes than the products of our competitors and that are accepted by consumers, or if our future product lines misjudge consumer demands, we may lose consumer loyalty, which could result in a decline in our sales and market share. Our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels. We maintain an inventory of selected products that we anticipate will be in high demand. We may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs or the sale of excess inventory at prices below our standard levels. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues, any of which could harm our business. Our license agreements may require minimum royalty commitments regardless of the level of product sales under these agreements. With respect to our license agreements, we have in the past experienced, and could again in the future experience, instances where minimum royalty commitments under these agreements exceeded royalties payable based upon our sales of such licensed products. We incurred royalty expense of approximately $109.4 million, $73.9 million and $74.9 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also have agreements in effect at the end of fiscal year 2010 which expire on various dates from December 2012 through December 2015 that require us to pay royalties ranging from 8% to 20% of defined net sales. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or ability to meet our customers demands. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including natural resources, increased freight costs, increased labor costs, especially in China, and weather conditions. In the future, we may not be able to pass on, all or a portion of, such higher raw materials prices to our customers. We rely on third party manufacturers and problems with, or loss of, our suppliers or raw materials could harm our business and results of operations. All of our clothing, shoes, sunglasses, handbags, small leather goods, belts, soft accessories and certain of our watch and jewelry products are produced by independent manufacturers. We do not have long term contracts with these manufacturers. In addition, we face the risk that these third party manufacturers, with whom we contract to produce our products, may not produce and deliver our products on a timely basis, or at all. As a result, we cannot be certain that these manufacturers will continue to manufacture products for us or that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, shortages of raw materials, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. The failure of any manufacturer to perform to our expectations could result in supply shortages for certain products and harm our business. 27 Table of Contents Access to suppliers that are not Fossil subsidiaries is not guaranteed because we do not maintain long term contracts but instead rely on long standing business relationships, which may not continue in the future. The majority of our watch products are currently assembled to our specifications by our majority owned entities in China with the remainder assembled by unrelated entities. Certain of our other products are currently manufactured to our specifications by independent manufacturers in international locations, including, but not limited to, China and Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent Italy, Mexico, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan. We have no long term contracts with these independent manufacturing sources and compete with other companies for production facilities. All transactions between us and our independent manufacturing sources are conducted on the basis of purchase orders. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain close relationships with our current suppliers and to develop long term relationships with other suppliers that satisfy our requirements for price, quality and production flexibility. Our ability to establish new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery. Any failure by us to maintain long term relationships with our current suppliers or to develop relationships with other suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. If an independent manufacturer or license partner of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer. We have no control over the ultimate actions or labor practices of our independent manufacturers. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers, or by one of our license partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturers or license partners labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other countries in which the violation or divergence occurred, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers or licensors be found in violation of state or international labor laws, we could suffer financial or other unforeseen consequences. We extend unsecured credit to our customers and are therefore vulnerable to any financial difficulties they may face. We sell our merchandise primarily to department stores and specialty retail stores worldwide. We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customers financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. Should any of our larger customers experience financial difficulties, we could curtail business with such customers or assume more credit risk relating to such customers receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable relating to such customers could have a material adverse effect on the amount of sales revenue that we receive and our financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain long term contracts with our customers and are unable to control their purchasing decisions. We do not maintain long term purchasing contracts with our customers and therefore have no contractual leverage over their purchasing decisions. A decision by a major department store or other significant customer to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating strategy. Our Direct to Consumer business segment operates in the highly competitive specialty retail, e commerce and catalog industry and the size and resources of some of our competitors are substantially greater than ours, which may allow them to compete more effectively. We face intense competition in the specialty retail, e commerce and catalog industry. We compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers and internet businesses that engage in the retail sale 28 Table of Contents of watches, accessories and clothing. We believe that the principal basis upon which we compete is the quality and design of merchandise and the quality of customer service. We also believe that price is an important factor in our customers decision making processes. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and generate greater national brand recognition than we can. This intense competition and greater size and resources of some of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our results of operations. We could be negatively impacted if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire. As part of our growth strategy, we have made certain acquisitions, domestically and internationally, including acquisitions of FOSSIL stores previously operated under license agreements, acquisitions of certain watch brands and acquisitions of independent distributors of our products. The integration of these and future acquisitions may not be successful or generate sales increases. When we have acquired businesses, we have acquired businesses that we believe could enhance our business opportunities and our growth prospects. All acquisitions involve risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risks include: distraction of management from our business operations; loss of key personnel and other employees; costs, delays, and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations and personnel; the impairment of acquired assets and goodwill; and acquiring the contingent and other liabilities of the businesses we acquire. In addition, acquired businesses may not provide us with increased business opportunities or result in the growth that we anticipate. Furthermore, integrating acquired operations is a complex, time consuming and expensive process. Combining acquired operations with our current operations may result in lower overall operating margins, greater stock price volatility and quarterly earnings fluctuations. Cultural incompatibilities, career uncertainties and other factors associated with such acquisitions may also result in the loss of employees. Failure to acquire and successfully integrate complementary practices, or failure to achieve the business synergies or other anticipated benefits, could materially adversely affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations. Our competitors are established companies that may have greater experience than us in a number of crucial areas, including design and distribution. There is intense competition in each of the businesses in which we compete. In all of our businesses, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors who may have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. Our competitors include distributors that import watches, accessories and clothing from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories and clothing domestically. Our results of operations and market position may be adversely affected by our competitors and their competitive pressures in the watch, fashion accessory and clothing industries. Our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our computer system and divert management time. In 2003, we began implementing an enterprise resource planning system from SAP AG, a German software company. We implemented the new enterprise resource planning system in our U.S., Germany, France, Italy and United Kingdom locations in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2010, respectively. We intend to replace our existing 29 Table of Contents enterprise resource planning systems and other principal financial systems in certain other subsidiaries located in Europe with software systems provided by SAP AG. We have implemented Navision as our standard system throughout most of our Far East distribution subsidiary operations. During 2007, we implemented this system in our principal Hong Kong office and China assembly facilities. Our current expansion plans may place significant strain on our management, working capital, financial and management control systems and staff. The failure to maintain or upgrade financial and management control systems, to recruit additional staff or to respond effectively to difficulties encountered during expansion could have a material adverse effect on our ability to respond to trends in our target markets, market our products and meet our customers requirements. The sustained disruption or failure of our systems due to force majeure or as part of an upgrade, conversion or other systems maintenance could result in the same adverse effects. Changes in the mix of product sales demand could negatively impact our gross profit margins. Our gross profit margins are impacted by our sales mix. Sales from our Direct to Consumer segment and international and licensed watch businesses generally provide gross margins in excess of our historical consolidated gross profit margin, while accessory products generally provide gross profit margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margin. If future sales from our Direct to Consumer segment and international and licensed watch businesses do not increase at a faster rate than our U.S. accessory business, our gross profit margins may grow at a slower pace, cease to grow, or decrease relative to our historical consolidated gross profit margin. We also distribute private label product to the mass market channel at gross profit margins significantly lower than our historical consolidated gross profit margin. Future growth in this channel at rates in excess of our consolidated net sales growth rate could negatively impact our consolidated gross profit margins. Our industry is subject to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our financial performance. We assemble or source many of our products offshore because they generally cost less to make overseas, due primarily to lower labor costs. Many of our competitors also source their product requirements offshore to achieve lower costs, possibly in locations with lower costs than our offshore operations, and those competitors may use these cost savings to reduce prices. To remain competitive, we must adjust our prices from time to time in response to these industry wide pricing pressures. Our financial performance may be negatively affected by these pricing pressures if we are forced to reduce our prices and we cannot reduce our production costs or our production costs increase and we cannot increase our prices. The loss of our intellectual property rights may harm our business. Our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We are devoted to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights in those countries where we believe it is important to our ability to sell our products. However, we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken will result in enforceable rights, will be adequate to protect our products in every country where we may want to sell our products, will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to prevent sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, we rely on the patent, trademark and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. Even if we are successful in obtaining appropriate trademark, patent and other intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. Because we sell our products internationally and are dependent on foreign manufacturing in China, we are significantly dependent on foreign countries to protect our intellectual property rights. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail. The failure to obtain or maintain trademark, patent or other intellectual property rights could materially harm our business. 30 Table of Contents Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Moreover, we may need to redesign or rename some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. An increase in product returns could negatively impact our operating results. We accept limited returns and will request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting credit returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. In addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could in turn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital. 31 Table of Contents Factors Relating to Our International Operations Factors affecting international commerce and our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from outside of the U.S., and we anticipate that revenue from our international operations could account for an increasingly larger portion of our net sales in the future. Our international operations are directly related to, and dependent on, the volume of international trade and foreign market conditions. International commerce and our international operations are subject to many risks, some of which are discussed in more detail below, including: recessions in foreign economies; the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions; limitations on repatriation of earnings; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights under the laws of other countries; longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing foreign operations; social, political and economic instability; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; our ability to finance foreign operations; tariffs and other trade barriers; and U.S. government licensing requirements for exports. The occurrence or consequences of any of these risks may restrict our ability to operate in the affected regions and decrease the profitability of our international operations, which may seriously harm our financial condition. Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition. We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars. However, we source a significant amount of our products overseas and, as such, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Danish Krone, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso, Norwegian Kroner, Singapore Dollar, Swedish Krona, Swiss Franc and Taiwanese Dollar. Due to our dependence on manufacturing operations in China, changes in the value of the Chinese Yuan may have a material impact on our supply channels and manufacturing costs, including component and assembly costs. Changes in the currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Although we utilize forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risks (mostly relating to the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar), if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We depend on independent distributors to sell our products in certain international markets. Our products are sold in certain international markets through independent distributors. If a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor. If a change in our distributors becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, as well as a substantial disruption in, and a resulting loss of, sales and profits. 32 Table of Contents Because we are dependent on foreign manufacturing, we are vulnerable to changes in economic and social conditions in Asia and disruptions in international travel and shipping. Because a substantial portion of our watches and certain of our handbags, sunglasses and other products are assembled or manufactured in China, our success will depend to a significant extent upon future economic and social conditions existing in China. If the factories in China were disrupted for any reason, we would need to arrange for the manufacture and shipment of products by alternative sources. Because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery, we are unable to predict whether such new relationships would be on terms that we regard as satisfactory. Any significant disruption in our relationships with our manufacturing sources located in China would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. Restrictions on travel to and from this and other regions, similar to those imposed during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, commonly known as SARS, and any delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products on account of SARS or other syndromes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer deadlines and timely distribute our products in order to match consumer tastes. Risks associated with foreign government regulations and U.S. trade policy may affect our foreign operations and sourcing. Our businesses are subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which our manufacturing sources are located, primarily China. While we have not experienced any material issues with foreign governmental regulations that would impact our arrangements with our foreign manufacturing sources, we believe that this issue is of particular concern with regard to China due to the less mature nature of the Chinese market economy and the historical involvement of the Chinese government in industry. If regulation were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable, or if our current foreign manufacturing sources were for any other reason to cease doing business with us, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and on our supply, manufacturing and distribution channels. Our business is also subject to the risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of most favored nation status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and financial condition. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to: quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the countries where our clothing producing facilities are located and foreign countries; and customs duties imposed by the governments where our clothing producing facilities are located on imported products, including raw materials. 33 Table of Contents Our clothing business is also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization, referred to as the WTO. Generally, such trade agreements benefit our clothing business by reducing or eliminating the duties and or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country. However, trade agreements can also impose requirements that negatively impact our clothing business, such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials and setting quotas on products that may be imported into the U.S. from a particular country. In addition, the WTO may commence a new round of trade negotiations that liberalize textile trade. This increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Many factors may cause our net sales, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate and possibly decline, which may result in declines in our stock price. Our net sales, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors may include, but may not be limited to, the following: fluctuations in market demand for our products; increased competition and pricing pressures; our ability to anticipate changing customer demands and preferences; our failure to efficiently manage our inventory levels; our inability to manage and maintain our debt obligations; seasonality in our business; changes in our, and our competitors, business strategy or pricing; the successful expansion of our owned retail stores; the timing of certain general and administrative expenses; completing acquisitions and the costs of integrating acquired operations; international currency fluctuations, operating challenges and trade regulations; acts of terrorism or acts of war; and government regulation. One or more of the foregoing factors, as well as any other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, may cause our operating expenses to be unexpectedly high or result in a decrease in our net sales during any given period. If these or any other variables or unknowns were to cause a shortfall in revenues or earnings, an increase in our operating costs or otherwise cause a failure to meet public market expectations, our stock price may decline and our business could be adversely affected. Two principal stockholders own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Kosta Kartsotis, our CEO, and Mr. Tom Kartsotis, founder of the Company, each own a substantial amount of our common stock. As a result, they are in a position to significantly influence the outcome of elections of our directors, the adoption, amendment or repeal of our bylaws and any other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, and to otherwise influence our affairs. Because the interests of Messrs. Kartsotis may not coincide with the interests of other shareholders, Messrs. Kartsotis may influence the Company to enter into transactions or agreements that other shareholders would not approve or make decisions with which other shareholders may disagree. 34 Table of Contents Our organizational documents contain anti takeover provisions that could discourage a proposal for a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a proposal for a takeover. These include a provision in our certificate of incorporation authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock; provisions in our bylaws establishing advance notice procedures with respect to certain stockholder proposals; and a provision stating that directors may be removed by the stockholders only for cause. Our bylaws may be amended by a vote of 80% of the Board of Directors, subject to repeal by a vote of 80% of the stockholders. In addition, Delaware law limits the ability of a Delaware corporation to engage in certain business combinations with interested stockholders. Finally, Messrs. Kartsotis have the ability, by virtue of their stock ownership, to significantly influence a vote regarding a change in control. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price. Mr. Kosta Kartsotis and Mr. Tom Kartsotis each own a substantial amount of our common stock. The shares beneficially owned by Mr. Kosta Kartsotis and Mr. Tom Kartsotis may be sold in the open market in the future, subject to any volume restrictions and other limitations under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 144 thereunder. We may also decide to file a registration statement enabling Messrs. Kartsotis to sell additional shares. Any sales by Messrs. Kartsotis of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of their shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur. These sales or the possibility that they may occur also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in any equity offering in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Item 1B.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of mens and womens fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses, soft accessories, shoes and clothing. In the watch and jewelry product category, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to service the needs of our customers, whether they are value conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. 40 Table of Contents Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, owned retail and factory outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL catalogs and website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macys, Dillards, JCPenney, Kohls, Sears, Wal Mart and Target. We also sell our products in the United States through a network of Company owned stores that included 121 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 70 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of January 1, 2011. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products through our catalogs and on our website, www.fossil.com, as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites. Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in over 120 countries worldwide through 23 Company owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of over 60 independent distributors. Our products are distributed in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Central and South America, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, and the Middle East. Our products are offered on airlines, cruise ships and in international Company owned retail stores, which included 150 retail stores and 23 outlet stores in select international markets as of January 1, 2011. Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. Our business is subject to global economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. Beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2008, declining values in real estate, reduced lending by banks, solvency concerns of major financial institutions, increases in unemployment levels and significant declines and volatility in the global financial markets negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. In North America, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and continuing through most of fiscal year 2009, the discretionary consumer segment experienced a significant slowdown in customer traffic and a highly promotional environment. These same conditions spread across many international markets during 2009. These factors negatively affected our business, as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. However, during fiscal year 2010, we experienced a pronounced recovery in our watch and jewelry businesses in many of the markets we service which has led to double digit net sales and net income increases. However, if economic conditions worsen or if the global or regional economies slip back into a recession, our revenues and earnings for fiscal year 2011 or beyond could be negatively impacted. The majority of our products are sold at price points ranging from $50 to $600. Although the current economic environment continues to weigh on consumer discretionary spending levels, we believe that the price/ value relationship and the differentiation and innovation of our products, in comparison to those of our competitors, will allow us to maintain or grow our market share in those markets in which we compete. Historically, during recessionary periods, the strength of our balance sheet, our strong operating cash flow and the relative size of our business with our wholesale customers, in comparison to that of our competitors, have allowed us to weather recessionary periods for longer periods of time and generally resulted in market share gains to us. Future sales and earnings growth are also contingent upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner while continuing to develop innovative products to distribute in the respective markets in which we compete. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs and products that we may introduce is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. We believe the double digit net sales growth we have experienced over the last five fiscal quarters is attributable to our ability to design innovative products incorporating a number of new materials that not only differentiate us from our competition but also continues to provide a solid value proposition to consumers across all of our brands and product categories. 41 Table of Contents Our international operations are subject to many risks, including foreign currency. Generally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of other countries in which we operate will reduce the translated amounts of sales and operating expenses of our subsidiaries, which results in a reduction of our consolidated operating income. We manage these currency risks by using derivative instruments. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is the future payments of intercompany inventory transactions, denominated in U.S. dollars, by non U.S. subsidiaries. We enter into forward contracts to manage fluctuations in global currencies that will ultimately be used to settle such U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. Effective January 3, 2010, we made changes to the presentation of reportable segments to reflect changes in the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. Prior to January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consisted of the following: United States Wholesale, Europe Wholesale, Other International Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. Effective January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consist of the following: North America Wholesale, Europe Wholesale, Asia Pacific Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. These changes include the reclassification of our wholesale operations in Canada and Mexico and our U.S. export business, all of which were previously recorded within our Other International Wholesale segment, to the North America Wholesale segment. Our U.S. domestic wholesale operations previously recorded within the United States Wholesale segment, have also been reclassified to the North America Wholesale segment. Our Asia Pacific Wholesale operations, previously recorded within the Other International Wholesale segment, have been reclassified to the Asia Pacific Wholesale segment. Our operations related to our joint venture with Fossil, Spain S.A., previously recorded within the Other International Wholesale segment, have been reclassified to the Europe Wholesale segment. For comparison purposes our historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation reserves and stock based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments. Product Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. Bad Debt. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for 42 Table of Contents estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified. Additionally, we secure credit insurance policies in certain countries. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future credit losses may differ from those experienced in the past. Our bad debt allowance has increased over the last three fiscal years due to the challenging global economic environment. As a result of the difficult economic environment, some of our customers both domestically and internationally have experienced financial difficulties including bankruptcy. We increased our bad debt allowance to reserve for these bankruptcies, increased risks of non payment and increased risk of customer charge backs. Our policy is to maintain the reserve balances for bankruptcies until such time as the bankruptcies are actually settled. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges, or market. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. Long lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles other than trade names whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We apply Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company owned full price retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, impairment losses are recorded in selling and distribution expenses. In addition, impairment losses resulting from property, plant and equipment in our corporate costs area are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses of $5.6 million, $2.5 million and $1.9 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Impairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. We have three reporting units under which we evaluate goodwill for impairment, North America Wholesale, Europe Wholesale and Asia Pacific Wholesale. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information. Based on the analysis, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its recorded value, no impairment loss is recognized. As of January 1, 2011, the fair values of each of our three operating segments containing goodwill substantially exceeded the respective carrying values. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting units fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill may be incurred. We evaluate trade names annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 97.7% and 88.9% of our total trade name balances as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively. We performed the required annual impairment test and recorded impairment losses of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2010 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names, $2.7 million in fiscal year 2009 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names and $7.9 million in fiscal year 2008 related to the MICHELE and ZODIAC trade names. As of January 1, 2011, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 72.0%. The ZODIAC trade name carrying value was written down to its fair value and the OYZTERBAY trade name carrying value was written down to zero. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value 43 Table of Contents analysis, actual results may differ which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods. Income Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding unusual or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate excluding the impact of infrequent or unusual items. Warranty Costs. Our FOSSIL watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for a period of 11 years from the date of purchase. RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a comparable 12 year limited warranty. All other watch brands sold in the U.S. as well as generally, all of our watch products sold in Canada, Europe and Asia are covered by a comparable two year limited warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The warranty liability recorded for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $8.5 million, $6.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Hedge Accounting. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We have elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging for these hedges. Our objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, and are recognized in other income (expense) net in the period which approximates the time the hedged inventory is sold. Litigation Reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims that may arise, changes in the circumstances used to estimate amounts for prior period claims and favorable or unfavorable final settlements of prior period claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revise estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or circumstances change relative to prior claim assessments, revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation (ASC 718). We utilize the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (a) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), (b) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and (c) the number of options that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of 44 Table of Contents stock based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. Newly Adopted Accounting Standard Codification Updates In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 6 Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820) (ASU 2010 6). ASU 2010 6 provides amendments to Subtopic 820 10 that require separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the presentation of separate information regarding purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, ASU 2010 6 provides amendments to Subtopic 820 10 that clarify existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques. The new disclosure requirements became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosure about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in Level 3 fair value measurements, which become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010 6 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 2 Consolidations (Topic 810) Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary a Scope Clarification (ASU 2010 2). ASU 2010 2 addresses implementation issues related to the changes in ownership provisions in the Consolidation Overall Subtopic (Subtopic 810 10) of the ASC. Subtopic 810 10 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary. An entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. Upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary, an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value. The gain or loss includes any gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value of the retained investment in the subsidiary and its carrying amount at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated. In contrast, an entity is required to account for a decrease in ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as an equity transaction. ASU 2010 2 became effective for us starting January 3, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010 2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 17 Consolidations (Topic 810) Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009 17). ASU 2009 17 amends the ASC for the issuance of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). The amendments in ASU 2009 17 replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. ASU 2009 17 also requires additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. ASU 2009 17 was effective for us starting January 3, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009 17 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position as we had no variable interest entities. In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 16 Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009 16). ASU 2009 16 amends the ASC for the issuance of FASB Statement No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. The amendments in ASU 2009 16 eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sales accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets. In addition, the amendments require enhanced disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. ASU 2009 16 was effective for us starting January 3, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009 16 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position as we had no mortgage securitizations. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, (i) the percentages of our net sales represented by certain line items from our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and (ii) the percentage changes in these line items between the fiscal years indicated.

North America Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in the North America Wholesale segment, which consists of our operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and sales to third party distributors in South America, increased 40.7%, or $224.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. We attribute this increase to consumers positive reactions to our innovative product offerings and an upward trend in the fashion watch category. These favorable watch sales trends have prompted retailers to place greater emphasis on the category by increasing staff to service the watch customer, increasing open to buy dollars and expanding marketing initiatives, thereby further accelerating net sales. The increased sell through rates of our watch products at our retailers have also resulted in these customers restocking inventories during fiscal year 2010, after heavily destocking inventory levels in fiscal year 2009 due to the economic downturn. Additionally, our customers have been increasing the level of inventories in certain situations, including allocating additional retail space within their stores, to meet the increased demand for our watch products. As a result of the acceleration in sales in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to the destocking activity in fiscal year 2009, North American wholesale watch shipments increased by 60.9%, or $207.9 million, in fiscal year 2010. Licensed brands, FOSSIL and MICHELE represented the strongest net sales contributions, increasing by 113.9%, 35.4% and 49.7%, respectively. Licensed brand watch sales were primarily led by sales volume increases in MICHAEL KORS of 218.4% or $95.5 million and, to a lesser extent, increases in EMPORIO ARMANI of 48.8%, DIESEL of 61.0%, DKNY of 46.8% and MARC BY MARC JACOBS of 61.0%. In addition, our RELIC watch business increased 20.8% during the fiscal year. MICHAEL KORS sales volumes were principally driven by innovative designs, increased sell through rates at retail and additional case space allocated by retailers in the department store channel. Our accessories business, which includes our mens and womens leather, jewelry, and other non watch categories, also contributed to the growth in North America as net sales volumes increased 7.9%, or $16.5 million, in fiscal year 2010. This increase was primarily a result of sales volume growth in FOSSIL accessory jewelry, shoes, womens small leathers, and sunglasses which had sales increases of 67.6%, 122.2%, 27.2% and 3.6%, respectively. Both our accessory jewelry and shoes categories were launched into the department store channel in the last two years and are still experiencing both door growth and, in some cases, assortment expansion. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of 2.6% and 3.8% in womens bags and mens leather products, respectively. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in our Europe Wholesale segment increased 22.8%, or $106.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2010 our Europe Wholesale segment benefited from a similar level of increased consumer response to new designs as we experienced in the North America segment. Additionally, net sales increases in fiscal year 2010 benefited from similar de stocking activities to that experienced in our North America segment, primarily during the last nine months of fiscal year 2009. Watch sales experienced the most significant growth, increasing 23.3%, or $78.5 million. All major watch brands contributed to this growth with increases of 19.7% in FOSSIL, 24.3% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 101.3% in MICHAEL KORS, 26.6% in DIESEL and 18.2% in DKNY representing the strongest performances. During fiscal year 2010, our jewelry and leather categories also delivered strong double digit increases of 21.0% and 46.7%, respectively. We believe net sales increases in our jewelry category were positively impacted by trends similar to those that we experienced in our watch business. We believe the growth experienced in our leather products business in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to expand our leather offerings in our wholesale channel by leveraging the increased brand awareness generated by the expansion of our FOSSIL accessory store concept in the region over the last two years. In addition, shipments to third party distributors increased 45.4% in fiscal year 2010, which we believe was principally related to increased sell through rates of our fashion watch offerings and to our distributors replenishing inventory during fiscal year 2010 in comparison to destocking inventory in the prior fiscal year. Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. In fiscal year 2010, Asia Pacific Wholesale shipments increased 35.0%, or $53.8 million, primarily a result of a 39.6% increase in licensed brand watch sales and, to a lesser extent, 47 Table of Contents increases of 19.4% in FOSSIL watches and 55.2% in leather products. Licensed brand watch sales were led by increases of 43.0% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 127.8% in MARC BY MARC JACOBS and 54.0% in BURBERRY. In addition to consumers responding favorably to new designs, we believe the growth in our watch business was due to the growth in our retail concession base across many of our markets within this segment, including the transition of our South Korean operations from a third party distributor to a Company owned subsidiary during the 2010 fiscal year. The net sales growth in the South Korea market represented 46.6% of the $53.8 million in net sales that we added within this segment in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to fiscal year 2009. The growth in the leather category in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to broaden distribution of the category by leveraging the FOSSIL brand awareness created from an expanded FOSSIL accessory store base in this region. We believe our diverse global distribution network, including owned distribution in 23 countries, combined with our design and marketing capabilities, will allow us to continue to take shelf space from lesser known local and regional brands as we continue to increase brand awareness through the growth of our retail stores and introduction of new websites in many of the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the expansion of our businesses into the newer markets will allow us to experience higher levels of growth in our international wholesale segments in comparison to our North America Wholesale segment. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to Consumer net sales increased 29.0%, or $108.9 million, during fiscal year 2010, principally the result of comparable store sales increases of 19.0% and a 5.9% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year. Additionally, our Direct to Consumer segment was favorably impacted in fiscal year 2010 by growth of 50.2% in e commerce sales primarily driven by our U.S. and Germany based e commerce businesses. During fiscal year 2010, comparable store sales related to our global full price accessory concept increased by 15.9%, while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 21.1%. We believe the growth in our Direct to Consumer business was attributable to consumers positive response to the focused point of view and imagery of the FOSSIL brand, the continuous introduction of new and innovative designs and materials, increased catalog mailings and expanded e commerce marketing activities. We ended fiscal year 2010 with 364 stores, including 230 full price accessory stores, 127 of which were outside of North America, 93 outlet locations, including 22 outside of North America, 31 clothing stores, including 3 outside of North America, and 10 full price multi brand stores, including 9 outside of North America. This compares to 354 stores at the end of fiscal year 2009, including 218 full price accessory stores, 116 of which were outside of North America, 90 outlet locations, including 15 outside of North America, 33 clothing stores, all in North America, and 13 full price multi brand stores, including 11 outside of North America. During fiscal year 2010, we opened 33 new stores and closed 23 stores. During fiscal year 2011, we anticipate opening approximately 80 to 85 additional retail stores and closing approximately 26 to 28 stores globally. A store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and or relocation. During 2006, we entered into an agreement with the House of Fraser, a U.K. based department store (HOF), which allows us to operate the watch department in certain HOF stores. Under this agreement, we own the inventory within the HOF store, provide the labor to operate the department and pay HOF a commission on the retail watch sales generated in the stores. Although we include the net sales derived from the HOF stores in our Direct to Consumer segment, we do not include the number of locations associated with this agreement in our retail store count or in our comparable store sales. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010 represented an increase of 36.7% in comparison to $844.9 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net sales and gross profit margin expansion. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points to 56.9% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 54.6% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit margin was principally driven by an increase in the 48 Table of Contents mix of sales of higher margin watch products in comparison to leather products, including a greater mix of higher margin licensed watch brands, and higher gross margins experienced in outlet stores. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a combination of decreased component costs associated with some of the new materials we incorporated into our watch designs and higher retail prices. These increases in gross profit margin were partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points during fiscal year 2010, and increased input costs related to payroll as a result of wage increases across our China assembly operations and third party component manufacturers. Our consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses, and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch, jewelry and sunglass offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods categories. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. From a segment standpoint, our Direct to Consumer business generally produces the highest gross profit margin as a result of these sales being direct to the ultimate consumer. Gross profit margins related to sales in our international wholesale segments are historically lower than our Direct to Consumer segment, but historically higher than our North America Wholesale segment primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S., (ii) the product sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America Wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America Wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased $145.5 million to $778.8 million in fiscal year 2010. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 38.3% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 40.9% in the prior fiscal year and included a favorable impact of approximately $3.5 million related to the translation of foreign based expenses due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses in our wholesale segments, Direct to Consumer segment and corporate cost areas increased by $78.9 million, $35.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2010. Expense growth in the wholesale segments was principally a result of increased marketing expenses and compensation costs. Expense increases in the Direct to Consumer segment were primarily attributable to store growth, expansion of our catalog mailings and increased web based marketing expenditures. Expense growth in the corporate cost area was primarily associated with increased compensation costs, including a $3.8 million increase in equity compensation expense, and a non cash charge of approximately $3.7 million related to the write down of an other than temporary fixed asset impairment. The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America Wholesale $ 146.3 18.8 % $ 118.9 21.6 % Europe Wholesale 164.1 30.0 146.0 31.3 Asia Pacific Wholesale 96.1 43.5 66.9 43.5 Direct to Consumer 258.2 53.4 222.6 59.2 Corporate 114.1 0.0 78.8 0.0 Total $ 778.8 38.3 % $ 633.2 40.9 % 49 Table of Contents Operating Income. Operating income increased by 77.9% to $376.4 million in fiscal year 2010 compared to $211.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Operating income margin increased by 480 basis points to 18.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2010 compared to 13.7% in the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of increased net sales, gross profit margin expansion and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating income included approximately $6.8 million of net currency losses in fiscal year 2010 related to the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $884,000 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily driven by increased participation by our Asia Pacific subsidiaries in our notional cash pool at interest rates in excess of those earned on cash deposits by our European subsidiaries in the pool. Other Income (Expense) Net. Other income (expense) net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2010, other income (expense) net increased favorably by approximately $409,000 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily driven by increased equity earnings of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain and increased interest income, partially offset by decreased net foreign currency transaction gains. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2010 was $119.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.1%, compared to 34.4% in fiscal year 2009. Fiscal year 2010 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits during the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2011, we estimate our effective tax rate will approximate our structural rate of 35%, excluding any discrete events. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which represents the minority interest portion of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100%, increased $4.6 million for fiscal year 2010. This increase is a result of increased net income related to our less than 100% wholly owned subsidiaries with a substantial portion of this increase attributable to the net income related to one of our watch assembly facilities. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2010 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 83.4% to $255.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in comparison to $139.2 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2010 earnings per diluted share of $3.77 included an approximate $0.07 diluted earnings per share reduction related to foreign currency rate changes. Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 Net Sales. The following table illustrates by factor the total year over year percentage change in net sales by segment and on a consolidated basis: Exchange Rates Organic Change Total Change North America Wholesale (0.7 )% (1.0 )% (1.7 )% Europe Wholesale (3.6 ) (11.7 ) (15.3 ) Asia Pacific Wholesale 0.6 (5.5 ) (4.9 ) Direct to Consumer (1.1 ) 22.7 21.6 Consolidated (1.6 )% (0.6 )% (2.2 )% The following net sales discussion excludes the impact on sales growth attributable to foreign currency rate changes as noted in the above table. North America Wholesale Net Sales. We believe wholesale shipments of our watch and accessory offerings were negatively impacted by our wholesale partners significantly reducing their purchases during the first half of 50 Table of Contents fiscal year 2009. We believe this was the result of our wholesale partners carrying higher levels of inventory into the beginning of the year due to the downturn in consumer spending during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Nevertheless, net sales in the North America Wholesale watch business increased 1.9% during fiscal year 2009, primarily a result of sales volume growth in licensed brands, mass market, RELIC and MICHELE watches, partially offset by a sales volume decrease in FOSSIL watches. Licensed watch sales rose 16.4%, principally driven by MICHAEL KORS and to a lesser extent ADIDAS and MARC BY MARC JACOBS watches. MICHAEL KORS wholesale shipments increased 104.4% during fiscal year 2009, which we believe is due to the innovative design that is represented by the assortment and the expansion of points of sale for the brand. Sales volume growth in ADIDAS and MARC BY MARC JACOBS was primarily attributable to the expansion of points of sale. During fiscal year 2009, our mass market watch shipments increased 10.2% in comparison to the prior fiscal year, which we attribute primarily to further penetration of our private label program with Wal Mart as well as consumers continuing to shop for value. RELIC watch sales rose 12.0% during fiscal year 2009, as a result of increased penetration in existing customers and new door growth. MICHELE sales volumes increased 9.6% during fiscal year 2009, which we attribute to consumers positive response to innovative new styles. North America Wholesale shipments of FOSSIL watches declined 18.9% during fiscal year 2009, which we believe resulted from retailers managing their inventories conservatively. FOSSIL is the most penetrated watch business within our portfolio in the North America Wholesale segment and thereby more significantly impacted by comparable stores sales within the department store channel. However, new FOSSIL styles introduced into department stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 experienced strong sell through during the holiday season, resulting in the overall trend improving. Wholesale shipments from our accessories business in North America, which primarily includes handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses, jewelry and cold weather accessories, decreased 5.4% during fiscal year 2009. This decrease was principally attributable to sales volume declines in FOSSIL womens handbags, small leather goods, and eyewear, partially offset by sales volume increases in FOSSIL accessory jewelry and the launch of our FOSSIL shoes line during fiscal year 2009. We primarily attribute the sales volume declines in womens handbags, small leather goods and eyewear of 11.0%, 17.8% and 20.4%, respectively, to the challenging economic environment resulting in decreased consumer demand and our wholesale partners reducing inventory levels during the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. Additionally, eyewear sales volume was unfavorably impacted by certain of our customers consolidating vendors in their sunglass departments and discontinuing the RELIC mens eyewear line. FOSSIL accessory jewelry net sales increased 22.4% in fiscal year 2009 as a result of retail door growth, while the launch of our FOSSIL shoes line contributed $2.9 million to the North America Wholesale business during fiscal year 2009. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. The net sales decline in our Europe Wholesale segment during fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of sales volume declines in our core watch and jewelry businesses of 11.5% and 19.7%, respectively. We believe that weakening economies and the resulting decrease in discretionary spending was the primary reason for our sales volume decreases in this segment. The declines had a bigger impact on our larger, more penetrated businesses. The decrease in our watch business was principally the result of FOSSIL and licensed brand watch sales volumes declining 8.5% and 11.7%, respectively, while the reduction in our jewelry sales volume was primarily led by a 22.9% decrease in FOSSIL jewelry. However, for brands and businesses recently introduced into our Europe Wholesale segment and for those brands and businesses less penetrated, and thus continuing to expand into new doors, we experienced sales growth. For example, our recently introduced FOSSIL leathers business increased 19.9% during fiscal year 2009, with solid growth in both the womens and mens categories. We believe the expansion of our leathers business is partly attributable to the growth of our FOSSIL accessory store concept in this region, which is continuing to improve the brand awareness across all FOSSIL categories. Additionally, MICHAEL KORS and BURBERRY watch sales volumes rose 4.5% and 6.7%, respectively, in fiscal year 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in the penetration level with existing customers and new door growth. During fiscal year 2009, net sales were also favorably impacted by the introduction of DKNY jewelry, launched during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. 51 Table of Contents Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in our Asia Pacific Wholesale segment decreased during fiscal year 2009, principally a result of a $19.5 million decline in wholesale shipments to our third party distributors. We attribute these sales declines to the challenging economic environment and credit restraints experienced by a number of our third party distributors. Excluding shipments to third party distributors, sales from our Asia Pacific Wholesale operations increased 12.8%, principally driven by further penetration in our newer markets of China, India and South Korea as well as a 15.5% increase generated in our Australian wholesale business primarily related to sales volume growth in FOSSIL leather goods. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to Consumer net sales increased 22.7% during fiscal year 2009, principally the result of a 19.4% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year and comparable store sales increases of 7.8%. Our Direct to Consumer segment was also favorably impacted by 11.4% growth in e commerce sales primarily driven by our U.S. based e commerce businesses. We believe this growth was partially attributable to system upgrades for our U.S. website during the second half of fiscal year 2009. Additionally, an increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal year 2009 and an increase in the amount of spending during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 in on line search advertising also benefited e commerce sales. These initiatives led to an increased number of visitors to the site resulting in higher levels of sales. Our e commerce and catalog initiatives, in addition to the favorable consumer reaction to new product innovation, also benefited our comparable store sales in our U.S. retail stores. Comparable store sales related to our full price accessory concept, which is our growth engine in this segment, increased by 5.9% globally while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 9.7% during fiscal year 2009. We ended fiscal year 2009 with 354 stores, including 218 full price accessory stores, 126 of which are located outside the U.S., 90 outlet locations, including 16 outside the U.S., 33 clothing stores and 13 multi brand stores. This compares to 324 stores at the end of fiscal year 2008, which included 191 full price accessory stores, 104 located outside the U.S., 82 outlet locations, including 8 outside the U.S., 33 clothing stores and 18 multi branded stores. During fiscal year 2009, we opened 42 new stores, including 29 full price accessory stores, and closed 12 stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 0.7% to $844.9 million in fiscal year 2009, with gross profit margin expanding by 80 basis points to 54.6% compared to 53.8% in the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin improvement was due primarily to an increase in the sales mix of Direct to Consumer segment sales and a reduction in sales mix of lower margin shipments to third party distributors. The increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 80 basis points during fiscal year 2009 and a reduction in the sales mix attributable to our Europe Wholesale segment, which historically generates a gross profit margin in excess of our consolidated gross profit margin. In comparison to fiscal year 2008, our fiscal year 2009 gross profit margin was not impacted by any significant changes in component or labor costs related to the production of our watch and accessory offerings. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $12.2 million to $633.2 million in fiscal year 2009 in comparison to the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of net sales, increased 10 basis points to 40.9% compared to 40.8% in fiscal year 2008. Fiscal year 2009 included a reduction of approximately $11.5 million related to the translation impact of foreign based expenses due to an average stronger U.S. dollar on a comparable year over year basis. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses for fiscal year 2009 included net decreases in our wholesale segments and corporate costs of $43.1 million, partially offset by an increase of $42.5 million in our Direct to Consumer segment. The decrease in operating expenses associated with our wholesale segments was primarily related to lower compensation cost, as a result of a reduction of workforce in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and the freeze of merit increases and certain benefit costs. Additionally, fiscal year 2009 wholesale operating expenses benefited from reduced levels of advertising expense and a net reduction of approximately $5.2 million of non cash charges related to the write down of certain fixed asset and intangible asset impairments when compared to fiscal year 2008. Fiscal year 2009 operating expenses also benefited from reductions in certain variable expenses as a result of a reduction in wholesale sales. The increase in our Direct to Consumer operating expenses was primarily related to the impact of the direct operating costs associated with a net 30 new stores opened during fiscal year 2009 and expenses associated with the expansion of our e commerce and catalog operations. 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2009 2008 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America Wholesale $ 118.9 21.6 % $ 144.9 25.8 % Europe Wholesale 146.0 31.3 170.3 30.9 Asia Pacific Wholesale 66.9 43.5 65.2 40.3 Direct to Consumer 222.6 59.2 183.4 59.3 Corporate 78.8 0.0 81.6 0.0 Total $ 633.2 40.9 % $ 645.4 40.8 % Operating Income. Operating income increased by 2.8% to $211.6 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to $205.8 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, operating income margin increased by 70 basis points to 13.7% of net sales compared to 13.0% in the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of gross margin expansion. Operating income included approximately $15.4 million of net currency losses in fiscal year 2009 related to the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Other Income (Expense) Net. Other income (expense) net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2009, other income (expense) net increased by approximately $19.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2008, primarily driven by net foreign currency transaction gains in comparison to net losses in the prior fiscal year. Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 34.4% during fiscal year 2009, compared to 27.0% in fiscal year 2008. The prior fiscal years income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2009 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 0.8% to $139.2 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in comparison to $138.1 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2009 earnings per diluted share of $2.07 included an approximate $0.07 diluted earnings per share benefit related to foreign currency rate changes. Fiscal year 2008 diluted earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.20 per diluted share as a result of the reduction of certain tax reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Effects of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Substantial increases in costs, however, could have an impact on us and the industry. We believe that, to the extent inflation affects our costs in the future, we could generally offset inflation by increasing prices if competitive conditions permit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the second quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by the number of new stores we open, other capital expenditures, and the amount of any discretionary stock repurchases we make. 53 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities of $209.2 million in fiscal year 2010 was more than offset by cash used in investing and financing activities of $47.5 million and $170.6 million respectively, resulting in a $12.4 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents since the end of fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $264.9 million and favorable non cash activities of $81.7 million, partially offset by unfavorable decreases in working capital of $137.4 million. During fiscal year 2010, cash used in investing activities were primarily driven by $46.5 million in capital expenditures. During fiscal year 2010, cash used in financing activities were principally comprised of $199.2 million of common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $23.4 million in proceeds relating to the exercise of stock options. Foreign exchange rate translations decreased cash and cash equivalents by $3.4 million during fiscal year 2010. Accounts receivable increased by 25.5% to $263.2 million during fiscal year 2010 compared to $209.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in wholesale shipments. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale segments for fiscal year 2010 was 48 days in comparison to 54 days in the prior fiscal year. Inventory at the end of fiscal year 2010 was $371.9 million, representing an increase of 51.4% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $245.7 million. This increase was primarily attributable to the following three factors: (i) In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, inventory levels decreased 16% while net sales increased 14%. Thus on a two fiscal year basis, inventory levels were much more consistent with the sales increases, (ii) Fiscal year 2010 ending inventory was impacted by a forward shift in the Chinese New Year which added approximately $30 million in inventory receipts and in transit shipments to the fourth quarter 2010 fiscal year inventory levels. In comparison to the comparable period of fiscal year 2009, the deliveries related to the timing of Chinese New Year did not occur until the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, and (iii) Since the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, we have been implementing a smoothing effort to remove part of the peaks and valleys associated with the timing of production needs while still supplying us with inventory levels sufficient to service our sales and store growth. During fiscal year 2009, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which $20 million could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares under this authorization during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 528,000 shares of common stock to complete this repurchase program. In fiscal year 2010, our Board of Directors approved two additional common stock repurchase programs pursuant to which up to $30 million and $750 million, respectively, could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. The $750 million repurchase program has a termination date of December 2013 and the $30 million repurchase program has no termination date. We repurchased 3.1 million shares under the $750 million repurchase program during fiscal year 2010 at a cost of $179.2 million. Both of these repurchase programs were conducted pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At the end of fiscal year 2010, we had working capital of $801.3 million compared to working capital of $701.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, we had approximately $5.3 million of outstanding short term borrowings and $4.5 million in long term debt. On December 17, 2010, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole book manager and Bank of America, N.A., as lender. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans in the amount of $300 million (the Revolver), a swingline loan of $20 million, and the provision for letters of credit. The Revolver increased our borrowing capability from $100 million to $300 million as it replaced the Loan Agreement dated as of September 23, 2004, as amended by and between us and certain of our subsidiaries. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver at the end of fiscal year 2010. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver bear interest at our option of (i) the base rate (defined as the higher of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo, (b) the federal funds rate plus 1.50% and (c) LIBOR plus 1.50%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies based upon our consolidated leverage ratio (the Ratio) from 0.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 1.00% if the Ratio is 54 Table of Contents greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Ratio from 1.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 2.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). Amounts outstanding under the swingline loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the base rate applicable margin. We had $0.4 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at January 1, 2011 that reduce amounts available under the Revolver. In December 2010, our Japanese subsidiary, Fossil Japan, entered into a new 400 million Yen short term credit facility agreement (the Facility). The Facility replaced two separate 150 million Yen short term credit facilities previously utilized for the working capital needs of Fossil Japan. The Facility bears interest at the short term prime rate (1.475% at fiscal year end 2010). At the end of fiscal year 2010, we had approximately $4.9 million of outstanding borrowings under the Facility which are included in short term borrowings. At January 1, 2011, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities. At the end of fiscal year 2010, we had approximately $4.5 million of outstanding long term borrowings, of which $3.9 million was related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Fossil Group Europe, Gmbh, in the form of a term note. This note has a variable interest term with an interest rate at the end of fiscal year 2010 of 2.0% with interest payments due quarterly. This note requires minimum principal payments of 100,000 Swiss Francs each year with no stated maturity and no penalties for early termination. During fiscal year 2011, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $100 million. This planned increase in capital expenditure levels is principally related to accelerating new store openings and increasing our infrastructure capacity across our sales, distribution, supply chain and back office functions. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, common stock repurchases and capital expenditures plans for the next twelve months. We also have access to amounts available under our credit facilities should additional funds be required.

Also includes amounts owed pursuant to various license and design service agreements under which we are obligated to pay the licensors a percentage of our net sales of these licensed products, subject to minimum scheduled royalty, design and advertising payments. (3) Consists primarily of outstanding letters of credit, which represent inventory purchase commitments that typically mature in one to eight months and open non cancelable purchase orders. (4) Management has only included its current ASC 740 liability in the table above. Long term amounts of $8.2 million have been excluded because the payment timing cannot be reasonably estimated.

Our third and fourth quarters, which include the back to school and Christmas season, have historically generated a significant portion of our annual 56 Table of Contents operating income. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers. We currently believe that our inventory levels at those of our largest customers in the U.S. which we have sufficient information to form an opinion were near their targeted inventory levels at the end of fiscal year 2010. As we expand our retail store base and e commerce businesses, sales from our Direct to Consumer segment may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of sales in our Direct to Consumer segment, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays and the mix of products sold by us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso as compared to the U.S. dollar. Due to our vertical nature whereby a significant portion of goods are sourced from our owned facilities, the foreign currency risks relate primarily to the necessary current settlement of intercompany inventory transactions. We employ a variety of operating practices to manage these market risks relative to foreign currency exchange rate changes and, where deemed appropriate, utilize foreign currency forward contracts. These operating practices include, among others, our ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars at spot rates and to maintain U.S. dollar pricing relative to sales of our products to certain distributors located outside the U.S. The use of foreign currency forward contracts allows us to offset exposure to rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. We use derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and do not use them for speculation or for trading. There were no significant changes in how we managed foreign currency transactional exposure in fiscal year 2010 and management does not anticipate any significant changes in such exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposure in the near future. At January 1, 2011, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell 96.9 million Euro for approximately $126.2 million, expiring through April 2012, 4.1 billion Japanese Yen for approximately $46.9 million, expiring through December 2012, 15.7 million British Pounds for approximately $25.0 million, expiring through April 2012, 22.3 million Australian Dollars for approximately $19.6 million, expiring through May 2012, 33.7 million Mexican Pesos for approximately $2.6 million, expiring through June 2011 and 10.1 million Canadian Dollars for approximately $9.9 million, expiring through December 2011. If we were to settle our Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar based contracts at fiscal year end 2010, the net result would be a net loss of approximately $6.1 million, net of taxes. At fiscal year end 2010, a 10% unfavorable change in the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies to which we have balance sheet transactional exposures would have reduced net pre tax income by $13.4 million. The translation of the balance sheets of our foreign based operations from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At fiscal year end 2010, a 10% unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the foreign currencies to which we have exposure would have reduced consolidated stockholders equity by approximately $34.9 million. In the view of management, these hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 57 Table of Contents

In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. Our business is subject to global economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. Beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2008, declining values in real estate, reduced lending by banks, solvency concerns of major financial institutions, increases in unemployment levels and significant declines and volatility in the global financial markets negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. In North America, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and continuing through most of fiscal year 2009, the discretionary consumer segment experienced a significant slowdown in customer traffic and a highly promotional environment. These same conditions spread across many international markets during 2009. These factors negatively affected our business, as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. However, during fiscal year 2010, we experienced a pronounced recovery in our watch and jewelry businesses in many of the markets we service which has led to double digit net sales and net income increases. However, if economic conditions worsen or if the global or regional economies slip back into a recession, our revenues and earnings for fiscal year 2011 or beyond could be negatively impacted. The majority of our products are sold at price points ranging from $50 to $600. Although the current economic environment continues to weigh on consumer discretionary spending levels, we believe that the price/ value relationship and the differentiation and innovation of our products, in comparison to those of our competitors, will allow us to maintain or grow our market share in those markets in which we compete. Historically, during recessionary periods, the strength of our balance sheet, our strong operating cash flow and the relative size of our business with our wholesale customers, in comparison to that of our competitors, have allowed us to weather recessionary periods for longer periods of time and generally resulted in market share gains to us. Future sales and earnings growth are also contingent upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner while continuing to develop innovative products to distribute in the respective markets in which we compete. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs and products that we may introduce is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. We believe the double digit net sales growth we have experienced over the last five fiscal quarters is attributable to our ability to design innovative products incorporating a number of new materials that not only differentiate us from our competition but also continues to provide a solid value proposition to consumers across all of our brands and product categories. 41 Table of Contents Our international operations are subject to many risks, including foreign currency. Generally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies of other countries in which we operate will reduce the translated amounts of sales and operating expenses of our subsidiaries, which results in a reduction of our consolidated operating income. We manage these currency risks by using derivative instruments. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is the future payments of intercompany inventory transactions, denominated in U.S. dollars, by non U.S. subsidiaries. We enter into forward contracts to manage fluctuations in global currencies that will ultimately be used to settle such U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. Effective January 3, 2010, we made changes to the presentation of reportable segments to reflect changes in the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. Prior to January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consisted of the following: United States Wholesale, Europe Wholesale, Other International Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. Effective January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consist of the following: North America Wholesale, Europe Wholesale, Asia Pacific Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. These changes include the reclassification of our wholesale operations in Canada and Mexico and our U.S. export business, all of which were previously recorded within our Other International Wholesale segment, to the North America Wholesale segment. Our U.S. domestic wholesale operations previously recorded within the United States Wholesale segment, have also been reclassified to the North America Wholesale segment. Our Asia Pacific Wholesale operations, previously recorded within the Other International Wholesale segment, have been reclassified to the Asia Pacific Wholesale segment. Our operations related to our joint venture with Fossil, Spain S.A., previously recorded within the Other International Wholesale segment, have been reclassified to the Europe Wholesale segment. For comparison purposes our historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation reserves and stock based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments. Product Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. Bad Debt. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for 42 Table of Contents estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified. Additionally, we secure credit insurance policies in certain countries. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future credit losses may differ from those experienced in the past. Our bad debt allowance has increased over the last three fiscal years due to the challenging global economic environment. As a result of the difficult economic environment, some of our customers both domestically and internationally have experienced financial difficulties including bankruptcy. We increased our bad debt allowance to reserve for these bankruptcies, increased risks of non payment and increased risk of customer charge backs. Our policy is to maintain the reserve balances for bankruptcies until such time as the bankruptcies are actually settled. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges, or market. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. Long lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangibles other than trade names whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We apply Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company owned full price retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, impairment losses are recorded in selling and distribution expenses. In addition, impairment losses resulting from property, plant and equipment in our corporate costs area are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses of $5.6 million, $2.5 million and $1.9 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Impairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. We have three reporting units under which we evaluate goodwill for impairment, North America Wholesale, Europe Wholesale and Asia Pacific Wholesale. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information. Based on the analysis, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its recorded value, no impairment loss is recognized. As of January 1, 2011, the fair values of each of our three operating segments containing goodwill substantially exceeded the respective carrying values. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting units fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill may be incurred. We evaluate trade names annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 97.7% and 88.9% of our total trade name balances as of fiscal year end 2010 and 2009, respectively. We performed the required annual impairment test and recorded impairment losses of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2010 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names, $2.7 million in fiscal year 2009 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names and $7.9 million in fiscal year 2008 related to the MICHELE and ZODIAC trade names. As of January 1, 2011, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 72.0%. The ZODIAC trade name carrying value was written down to its fair value and the OYZTERBAY trade name carrying value was written down to zero. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value 43 Table of Contents analysis, actual results may differ which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods. Income Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding unusual or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate excluding the impact of infrequent or unusual items. Warranty Costs. Our FOSSIL watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for a period of 11 years from the date of purchase. RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a comparable 12 year limited warranty. All other watch brands sold in the U.S. as well as generally, all of our watch products sold in Canada, Europe and Asia are covered by a comparable two year limited warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The warranty liability recorded for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $8.5 million, $6.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Hedge Accounting. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We have elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging for these hedges. Our objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, and are recognized in other income (expense) net in the period which approximates the time the hedged inventory is sold. Litigation Reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims that may arise, changes in the circumstances used to estimate amounts for prior period claims and favorable or unfavorable final settlements of prior period claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revise estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or circumstances change relative to prior claim assessments, revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation (ASC 718). We utilize the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (a) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), (b) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and (c) the number of options that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of 44 Table of Contents stock based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. Newly Adopted Accounting Standard Codification Updates In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 6 Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820) (ASU 2010 6). ASU 2010 6 provides amendments to Subtopic 820 10 that require separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the presentation of separate information regarding purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, ASU 2010 6 provides amendments to Subtopic 820 10 that clarify existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques. The new disclosure requirements became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosure about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in Level 3 fair value measurements, which become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010 6 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 2 Consolidations (Topic 810) Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary a Scope Clarification (ASU 2010 2). ASU 2010 2 addresses implementation issues related to the changes in ownership provisions in the Consolidation Overall Subtopic (Subtopic 810 10) of the ASC. Subtopic 810 10 establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary. An entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. Upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary, an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value. The gain or loss includes any gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value of the retained investment in the subsidiary and its carrying amount at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated. In contrast, an entity is required to account for a decrease in ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as an equity transaction. ASU 2010 2 became effective for us starting January 3, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010 2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 17 Consolidations (Topic 810) Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009 17). ASU 2009 17 amends the ASC for the issuance of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). The amendments in ASU 2009 17 replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. ASU 2009 17 also requires additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. ASU 2009 17 was effective for us starting January 3, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009 17 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position as we had no variable interest entities. In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 16 Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009 16). ASU 2009 16 amends the ASC for the issuance of FASB Statement No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. The amendments in ASU 2009 16 eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sales accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred financial assets. In addition, the amendments require enhanced disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets. ASU 2009 16 was effective for us starting January 3, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009 16 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position as we had no mortgage securitizations. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, (i) the percentages of our net sales represented by certain line items from our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and (ii) the percentage changes in these line items between the fiscal years indicated.

North America Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in the North America Wholesale segment, which consists of our operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and sales to third party distributors in South America, increased 40.7%, or $224.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. We attribute this increase to consumers positive reactions to our innovative product offerings and an upward trend in the fashion watch category. These favorable watch sales trends have prompted retailers to place greater emphasis on the category by increasing staff to service the watch customer, increasing open to buy dollars and expanding marketing initiatives, thereby further accelerating net sales. The increased sell through rates of our watch products at our retailers have also resulted in these customers restocking inventories during fiscal year 2010, after heavily destocking inventory levels in fiscal year 2009 due to the economic downturn. Additionally, our customers have been increasing the level of inventories in certain situations, including allocating additional retail space within their stores, to meet the increased demand for our watch products. As a result of the acceleration in sales in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to the destocking activity in fiscal year 2009, North American wholesale watch shipments increased by 60.9%, or $207.9 million, in fiscal year 2010. Licensed brands, FOSSIL and MICHELE represented the strongest net sales contributions, increasing by 113.9%, 35.4% and 49.7%, respectively. Licensed brand watch sales were primarily led by sales volume increases in MICHAEL KORS of 218.4% or $95.5 million and, to a lesser extent, increases in EMPORIO ARMANI of 48.8%, DIESEL of 61.0%, DKNY of 46.8% and MARC BY MARC JACOBS of 61.0%. In addition, our RELIC watch business increased 20.8% during the fiscal year. MICHAEL KORS sales volumes were principally driven by innovative designs, increased sell through rates at retail and additional case space allocated by retailers in the department store channel. Our accessories business, which includes our mens and womens leather, jewelry, and other non watch categories, also contributed to the growth in North America as net sales volumes increased 7.9%, or $16.5 million, in fiscal year 2010. This increase was primarily a result of sales volume growth in FOSSIL accessory jewelry, shoes, womens small leathers, and sunglasses which had sales increases of 67.6%, 122.2%, 27.2% and 3.6%, respectively. Both our accessory jewelry and shoes categories were launched into the department store channel in the last two years and are still experiencing both door growth and, in some cases, assortment expansion. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of 2.6% and 3.8% in womens bags and mens leather products, respectively. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in our Europe Wholesale segment increased 22.8%, or $106.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2010 our Europe Wholesale segment benefited from a similar level of increased consumer response to new designs as we experienced in the North America segment. Additionally, net sales increases in fiscal year 2010 benefited from similar de stocking activities to that experienced in our North America segment, primarily during the last nine months of fiscal year 2009. Watch sales experienced the most significant growth, increasing 23.3%, or $78.5 million. All major watch brands contributed to this growth with increases of 19.7% in FOSSIL, 24.3% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 101.3% in MICHAEL KORS, 26.6% in DIESEL and 18.2% in DKNY representing the strongest performances. During fiscal year 2010, our jewelry and leather categories also delivered strong double digit increases of 21.0% and 46.7%, respectively. We believe net sales increases in our jewelry category were positively impacted by trends similar to those that we experienced in our watch business. We believe the growth experienced in our leather products business in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to expand our leather offerings in our wholesale channel by leveraging the increased brand awareness generated by the expansion of our FOSSIL accessory store concept in the region over the last two years. In addition, shipments to third party distributors increased 45.4% in fiscal year 2010, which we believe was principally related to increased sell through rates of our fashion watch offerings and to our distributors replenishing inventory during fiscal year 2010 in comparison to destocking inventory in the prior fiscal year. Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. In fiscal year 2010, Asia Pacific Wholesale shipments increased 35.0%, or $53.8 million, primarily a result of a 39.6% increase in licensed brand watch sales and, to a lesser extent, 47 Table of Contents increases of 19.4% in FOSSIL watches and 55.2% in leather products. Licensed brand watch sales were led by increases of 43.0% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 127.8% in MARC BY MARC JACOBS and 54.0% in BURBERRY. In addition to consumers responding favorably to new designs, we believe the growth in our watch business was due to the growth in our retail concession base across many of our markets within this segment, including the transition of our South Korean operations from a third party distributor to a Company owned subsidiary during the 2010 fiscal year. The net sales growth in the South Korea market represented 46.6% of the $53.8 million in net sales that we added within this segment in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to fiscal year 2009. The growth in the leather category in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to broaden distribution of the category by leveraging the FOSSIL brand awareness created from an expanded FOSSIL accessory store base in this region. We believe our diverse global distribution network, including owned distribution in 23 countries, combined with our design and marketing capabilities, will allow us to continue to take shelf space from lesser known local and regional brands as we continue to increase brand awareness through the growth of our retail stores and introduction of new websites in many of the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the expansion of our businesses into the newer markets will allow us to experience higher levels of growth in our international wholesale segments in comparison to our North America Wholesale segment. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to Consumer net sales increased 29.0%, or $108.9 million, during fiscal year 2010, principally the result of comparable store sales increases of 19.0% and a 5.9% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year. Additionally, our Direct to Consumer segment was favorably impacted in fiscal year 2010 by growth of 50.2% in e commerce sales primarily driven by our U.S. and Germany based e commerce businesses. During fiscal year 2010, comparable store sales related to our global full price accessory concept increased by 15.9%, while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 21.1%. We believe the growth in our Direct to Consumer business was attributable to consumers positive response to the focused point of view and imagery of the FOSSIL brand, the continuous introduction of new and innovative designs and materials, increased catalog mailings and expanded e commerce marketing activities. We ended fiscal year 2010 with 364 stores, including 230 full price accessory stores, 127 of which were outside of North America, 93 outlet locations, including 22 outside of North America, 31 clothing stores, including 3 outside of North America, and 10 full price multi brand stores, including 9 outside of North America. This compares to 354 stores at the end of fiscal year 2009, including 218 full price accessory stores, 116 of which were outside of North America, 90 outlet locations, including 15 outside of North America, 33 clothing stores, all in North America, and 13 full price multi brand stores, including 11 outside of North America. During fiscal year 2010, we opened 33 new stores and closed 23 stores. During fiscal year 2011, we anticipate opening approximately 80 to 85 additional retail stores and closing approximately 26 to 28 stores globally. A store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and or relocation. During 2006, we entered into an agreement with the House of Fraser, a U.K. based department store (HOF), which allows us to operate the watch department in certain HOF stores. Under this agreement, we own the inventory within the HOF store, provide the labor to operate the department and pay HOF a commission on the retail watch sales generated in the stores. Although we include the net sales derived from the HOF stores in our Direct to Consumer segment, we do not include the number of locations associated with this agreement in our retail store count or in our comparable store sales. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010 represented an increase of 36.7% in comparison to $844.9 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net sales and gross profit margin expansion. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points to 56.9% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 54.6% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit margin was principally driven by an increase in the 48 Table of Contents mix of sales of higher margin watch products in comparison to leather products, including a greater mix of higher margin licensed watch brands, and higher gross margins experienced in outlet stores. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a combination of decreased component costs associated with some of the new materials we incorporated into our watch designs and higher retail prices. These increases in gross profit margin were partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points during fiscal year 2010, and increased input costs related to payroll as a result of wage increases across our China assembly operations and third party component manufacturers. Our consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses, and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch, jewelry and sunglass offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods categories. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. From a segment standpoint, our Direct to Consumer business generally produces the highest gross profit margin as a result of these sales being direct to the ultimate consumer. Gross profit margins related to sales in our international wholesale segments are historically lower than our Direct to Consumer segment, but historically higher than our North America Wholesale segment primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S., (ii) the product sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America Wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America Wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased $145.5 million to $778.8 million in fiscal year 2010. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 38.3% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 40.9% in the prior fiscal year and included a favorable impact of approximately $3.5 million related to the translation of foreign based expenses due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses in our wholesale segments, Direct to Consumer segment and corporate cost areas increased by $78.9 million, $35.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2010. Expense growth in the wholesale segments was principally a result of increased marketing expenses and compensation costs. Expense increases in the Direct to Consumer segment were primarily attributable to store growth, expansion of our catalog mailings and increased web based marketing expenditures. Expense growth in the corporate cost area was primarily associated with increased compensation costs, including a $3.8 million increase in equity compensation expense, and a non cash charge of approximately $3.7 million related to the write down of an other than temporary fixed asset impairment. The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America Wholesale $ 146.3 18.8 % $ 118.9 21.6 % Europe Wholesale 164.1 30.0 146.0 31.3 Asia Pacific Wholesale 96.1 43.5 66.9 43.5 Direct to Consumer 258.2 53.4 222.6 59.2 Corporate 114.1 0.0 78.8 0.0 Total $ 778.8 38.3 % $ 633.2 40.9 % 49 Table of Contents Operating Income. Operating income increased by 77.9% to $376.4 million in fiscal year 2010 compared to $211.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Operating income margin increased by 480 basis points to 18.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2010 compared to 13.7% in the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of increased net sales, gross profit margin expansion and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating income included approximately $6.8 million of net currency losses in fiscal year 2010 related to the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $884,000 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily driven by increased participation by our Asia Pacific subsidiaries in our notional cash pool at interest rates in excess of those earned on cash deposits by our European subsidiaries in the pool. Other Income (Expense) Net. Other income (expense) net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2010, other income (expense) net increased favorably by approximately $409,000 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily driven by increased equity earnings of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain and increased interest income, partially offset by decreased net foreign currency transaction gains. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2010 was $119.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.1%, compared to 34.4% in fiscal year 2009. Fiscal year 2010 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits during the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2011, we estimate our effective tax rate will approximate our structural rate of 35%, excluding any discrete events. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which represents the minority interest portion of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100%, increased $4.6 million for fiscal year 2010. This increase is a result of increased net income related to our less than 100% wholly owned subsidiaries with a substantial portion of this increase attributable to the net income related to one of our watch assembly facilities. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2010 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 83.4% to $255.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in comparison to $139.2 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2010 earnings per diluted share of $3.77 included an approximate $0.07 diluted earnings per share reduction related to foreign currency rate changes. Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 Net Sales. The following table illustrates by factor the total year over year percentage change in net sales by segment and on a consolidated basis: Exchange Rates Organic Change Total Change North America Wholesale (0.7 )% (1.0 )% (1.7 )% Europe Wholesale (3.6 ) (11.7 ) (15.3 ) Asia Pacific Wholesale 0.6 (5.5 ) (4.9 ) Direct to Consumer (1.1 ) 22.7 21.6 Consolidated (1.6 )% (0.6 )% (2.2 )% The following net sales discussion excludes the impact on sales growth attributable to foreign currency rate changes as noted in the above table. North America Wholesale Net Sales. We believe wholesale shipments of our watch and accessory offerings were negatively impacted by our wholesale partners significantly reducing their purchases during the first half of 50 Table of Contents fiscal year 2009. We believe this was the result of our wholesale partners carrying higher levels of inventory into the beginning of the year due to the downturn in consumer spending during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Nevertheless, net sales in the North America Wholesale watch business increased 1.9% during fiscal year 2009, primarily a result of sales volume growth in licensed brands, mass market, RELIC and MICHELE watches, partially offset by a sales volume decrease in FOSSIL watches. Licensed watch sales rose 16.4%, principally driven by MICHAEL KORS and to a lesser extent ADIDAS and MARC BY MARC JACOBS watches. MICHAEL KORS wholesale shipments increased 104.4% during fiscal year 2009, which we believe is due to the innovative design that is represented by the assortment and the expansion of points of sale for the brand. Sales volume growth in ADIDAS and MARC BY MARC JACOBS was primarily attributable to the expansion of points of sale. During fiscal year 2009, our mass market watch shipments increased 10.2% in comparison to the prior fiscal year, which we attribute primarily to further penetration of our private label program with Wal Mart as well as consumers continuing to shop for value. RELIC watch sales rose 12.0% during fiscal year 2009, as a result of increased penetration in existing customers and new door growth. MICHELE sales volumes increased 9.6% during fiscal year 2009, which we attribute to consumers positive response to innovative new styles. North America Wholesale shipments of FOSSIL watches declined 18.9% during fiscal year 2009, which we believe resulted from retailers managing their inventories conservatively. FOSSIL is the most penetrated watch business within our portfolio in the North America Wholesale segment and thereby more significantly impacted by comparable stores sales within the department store channel. However, new FOSSIL styles introduced into department stores during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 experienced strong sell through during the holiday season, resulting in the overall trend improving. Wholesale shipments from our accessories business in North America, which primarily includes handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses, jewelry and cold weather accessories, decreased 5.4% during fiscal year 2009. This decrease was principally attributable to sales volume declines in FOSSIL womens handbags, small leather goods, and eyewear, partially offset by sales volume increases in FOSSIL accessory jewelry and the launch of our FOSSIL shoes line during fiscal year 2009. We primarily attribute the sales volume declines in womens handbags, small leather goods and eyewear of 11.0%, 17.8% and 20.4%, respectively, to the challenging economic environment resulting in decreased consumer demand and our wholesale partners reducing inventory levels during the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. Additionally, eyewear sales volume was unfavorably impacted by certain of our customers consolidating vendors in their sunglass departments and discontinuing the RELIC mens eyewear line. FOSSIL accessory jewelry net sales increased 22.4% in fiscal year 2009 as a result of retail door growth, while the launch of our FOSSIL shoes line contributed $2.9 million to the North America Wholesale business during fiscal year 2009. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. The net sales decline in our Europe Wholesale segment during fiscal year 2009 was primarily the result of sales volume declines in our core watch and jewelry businesses of 11.5% and 19.7%, respectively. We believe that weakening economies and the resulting decrease in discretionary spending was the primary reason for our sales volume decreases in this segment. The declines had a bigger impact on our larger, more penetrated businesses. The decrease in our watch business was principally the result of FOSSIL and licensed brand watch sales volumes declining 8.5% and 11.7%, respectively, while the reduction in our jewelry sales volume was primarily led by a 22.9% decrease in FOSSIL jewelry. However, for brands and businesses recently introduced into our Europe Wholesale segment and for those brands and businesses less penetrated, and thus continuing to expand into new doors, we experienced sales growth. For example, our recently introduced FOSSIL leathers business increased 19.9% during fiscal year 2009, with solid growth in both the womens and mens categories. We believe the expansion of our leathers business is partly attributable to the growth of our FOSSIL accessory store concept in this region, which is continuing to improve the brand awareness across all FOSSIL categories. Additionally, MICHAEL KORS and BURBERRY watch sales volumes rose 4.5% and 6.7%, respectively, in fiscal year 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in the penetration level with existing customers and new door growth. During fiscal year 2009, net sales were also favorably impacted by the introduction of DKNY jewelry, launched during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. 51 Table of Contents Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in our Asia Pacific Wholesale segment decreased during fiscal year 2009, principally a result of a $19.5 million decline in wholesale shipments to our third party distributors. We attribute these sales declines to the challenging economic environment and credit restraints experienced by a number of our third party distributors. Excluding shipments to third party distributors, sales from our Asia Pacific Wholesale operations increased 12.8%, principally driven by further penetration in our newer markets of China, India and South Korea as well as a 15.5% increase generated in our Australian wholesale business primarily related to sales volume growth in FOSSIL leather goods. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to Consumer net sales increased 22.7% during fiscal year 2009, principally the result of a 19.4% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year and comparable store sales increases of 7.8%. Our Direct to Consumer segment was also favorably impacted by 11.4% growth in e commerce sales primarily driven by our U.S. based e commerce businesses. We believe this growth was partially attributable to system upgrades for our U.S. website during the second half of fiscal year 2009. Additionally, an increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal year 2009 and an increase in the amount of spending during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 in on line search advertising also benefited e commerce sales. These initiatives led to an increased number of visitors to the site resulting in higher levels of sales. Our e commerce and catalog initiatives, in addition to the favorable consumer reaction to new product innovation, also benefited our comparable store sales in our U.S. retail stores. Comparable store sales related to our full price accessory concept, which is our growth engine in this segment, increased by 5.9% globally while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 9.7% during fiscal year 2009. We ended fiscal year 2009 with 354 stores, including 218 full price accessory stores, 126 of which are located outside the U.S., 90 outlet locations, including 16 outside the U.S., 33 clothing stores and 13 multi brand stores. This compares to 324 stores at the end of fiscal year 2008, which included 191 full price accessory stores, 104 located outside the U.S., 82 outlet locations, including 8 outside the U.S., 33 clothing stores and 18 multi branded stores. During fiscal year 2009, we opened 42 new stores, including 29 full price accessory stores, and closed 12 stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 0.7% to $844.9 million in fiscal year 2009, with gross profit margin expanding by 80 basis points to 54.6% compared to 53.8% in the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin improvement was due primarily to an increase in the sales mix of Direct to Consumer segment sales and a reduction in sales mix of lower margin shipments to third party distributors. The increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 80 basis points during fiscal year 2009 and a reduction in the sales mix attributable to our Europe Wholesale segment, which historically generates a gross profit margin in excess of our consolidated gross profit margin. In comparison to fiscal year 2008, our fiscal year 2009 gross profit margin was not impacted by any significant changes in component or labor costs related to the production of our watch and accessory offerings. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $12.2 million to $633.2 million in fiscal year 2009 in comparison to the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of net sales, increased 10 basis points to 40.9% compared to 40.8% in fiscal year 2008. Fiscal year 2009 included a reduction of approximately $11.5 million related to the translation impact of foreign based expenses due to an average stronger U.S. dollar on a comparable year over year basis. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses for fiscal year 2009 included net decreases in our wholesale segments and corporate costs of $43.1 million, partially offset by an increase of $42.5 million in our Direct to Consumer segment. The decrease in operating expenses associated with our wholesale segments was primarily related to lower compensation cost, as a result of a reduction of workforce in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and the freeze of merit increases and certain benefit costs. Additionally, fiscal year 2009 wholesale operating expenses benefited from reduced levels of advertising expense and a net reduction of approximately $5.2 million of non cash charges related to the write down of certain fixed asset and intangible asset impairments when compared to fiscal year 2008. Fiscal year 2009 operating expenses also benefited from reductions in certain variable expenses as a result of a reduction in wholesale sales. The increase in our Direct to Consumer operating expenses was primarily related to the impact of the direct operating costs associated with a net 30 new stores opened during fiscal year 2009 and expenses associated with the expansion of our e commerce and catalog operations. 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2009 2008 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America Wholesale $ 118.9 21.6 % $ 144.9 25.8 % Europe Wholesale 146.0 31.3 170.3 30.9 Asia Pacific Wholesale 66.9 43.5 65.2 40.3 Direct to Consumer 222.6 59.2 183.4 59.3 Corporate 78.8 0.0 81.6 0.0 Total $ 633.2 40.9 % $ 645.4 40.8 % Operating Income. Operating income increased by 2.8% to $211.6 million in fiscal year 2009 compared to $205.8 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, operating income margin increased by 70 basis points to 13.7% of net sales compared to 13.0% in the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of gross margin expansion. Operating income included approximately $15.4 million of net currency losses in fiscal year 2009 related to the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Other Income (Expense) Net. Other income (expense) net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2009, other income (expense) net increased by approximately $19.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2008, primarily driven by net foreign currency transaction gains in comparison to net losses in the prior fiscal year. Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 34.4% during fiscal year 2009, compared to 27.0% in fiscal year 2008. The prior fiscal years income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2009 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 0.8% to $139.2 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in comparison to $138.1 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2009 earnings per diluted share of $2.07 included an approximate $0.07 diluted earnings per share benefit related to foreign currency rate changes. Fiscal year 2008 diluted earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.20 per diluted share as a result of the reduction of certain tax reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Effects of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Substantial increases in costs, however, could have an impact on us and the industry. We believe that, to the extent inflation affects our costs in the future, we could generally offset inflation by increasing prices if competitive conditions permit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the second quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by the number of new stores we open, other capital expenditures, and the amount of any discretionary stock repurchases we make. 53 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities of $209.2 million in fiscal year 2010 was more than offset by cash used in investing and financing activities of $47.5 million and $170.6 million respectively, resulting in a $12.4 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents since the end of fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $264.9 million and favorable non cash activities of $81.7 million, partially offset by unfavorable decreases in working capital of $137.4 million. During fiscal year 2010, cash used in investing activities were primarily driven by $46.5 million in capital expenditures. During fiscal year 2010, cash used in financing activities were principally comprised of $199.2 million of common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $23.4 million in proceeds relating to the exercise of stock options. Foreign exchange rate translations decreased cash and cash equivalents by $3.4 million during fiscal year 2010. Accounts receivable increased by 25.5% to $263.2 million during fiscal year 2010 compared to $209.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in wholesale shipments. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale segments for fiscal year 2010 was 48 days in comparison to 54 days in the prior fiscal year. Inventory at the end of fiscal year 2010 was $371.9 million, representing an increase of 51.4% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $245.7 million. This increase was primarily attributable to the following three factors: (i) In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, inventory levels decreased 16% while net sales increased 14%. Thus on a two fiscal year basis, inventory levels were much more consistent with the sales increases, (ii) Fiscal year 2010 ending inventory was impacted by a forward shift in the Chinese New Year which added approximately $30 million in inventory receipts and in transit shipments to the fourth quarter 2010 fiscal year inventory levels. In comparison to the comparable period of fiscal year 2009, the deliveries related to the timing of Chinese New Year did not occur until the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, and (iii) Since the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, we have been implementing a smoothing effort to remove part of the peaks and valleys associated with the timing of production needs while still supplying us with inventory levels sufficient to service our sales and store growth. During fiscal year 2009, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which $20 million could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares under this authorization during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 528,000 shares of common stock to complete this repurchase program. In fiscal year 2010, our Board of Directors approved two additional common stock repurchase programs pursuant to which up to $30 million and $750 million, respectively, could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. The $750 million repurchase program has a termination date of December 2013 and the $30 million repurchase program has no termination date. We repurchased 3.1 million shares under the $750 million repurchase program during fiscal year 2010 at a cost of $179.2 million. Both of these repurchase programs were conducted pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At the end of fiscal year 2010, we had working capital of $801.3 million compared to working capital of $701.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, we had approximately $5.3 million of outstanding short term borrowings and $4.5 million in long term debt. On December 17, 2010, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole book manager and Bank of America, N.A., as lender. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans in the amount of $300 million (the Revolver), a swingline loan of $20 million, and the provision for letters of credit. The Revolver increased our borrowing capability from $100 million to $300 million as it replaced the Loan Agreement dated as of September 23, 2004, as amended by and between us and certain of our subsidiaries. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver at the end of fiscal year 2010. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver bear interest at our option of (i) the base rate (defined as the higher of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo, (b) the federal funds rate plus 1.50% and (c) LIBOR plus 1.50%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies based upon our consolidated leverage ratio (the Ratio) from 0.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 1.00% if the Ratio is 54 Table of Contents greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Ratio from 1.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 2.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). Amounts outstanding under the swingline loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the base rate applicable margin. We had $0.4 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at January 1, 2011 that reduce amounts available under the Revolver. In December 2010, our Japanese subsidiary, Fossil Japan, entered into a new 400 million Yen short term credit facility agreement (the Facility). The Facility replaced two separate 150 million Yen short term credit facilities previously utilized for the working capital needs of Fossil Japan. The Facility bears interest at the short term prime rate (1.475% at fiscal year end 2010). At the end of fiscal year 2010, we had approximately $4.9 million of outstanding borrowings under the Facility which are included in short term borrowings. At January 1, 2011, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities. At the end of fiscal year 2010, we had approximately $4.5 million of outstanding long term borrowings, of which $3.9 million was related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Fossil Group Europe, Gmbh, in the form of a term note. This note has a variable interest term with an interest rate at the end of fiscal year 2010 of 2.0% with interest payments due quarterly. This note requires minimum principal payments of 100,000 Swiss Francs each year with no stated maturity and no penalties for early termination. During fiscal year 2011, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $100 million. This planned increase in capital expenditure levels is principally related to accelerating new store openings and increasing our infrastructure capacity across our sales, distribution, supply chain and back office functions. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, common stock repurchases and capital expenditures plans for the next twelve months. We also have access to amounts available under our credit facilities should additional funds be required.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None 55 Table of Contents Selected Quarterly Financial Data The table below sets forth selected quarterly financial information. The information is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and includes, in the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Certain line items presented in the tables below, when aggregated, may not agree with the corresponding line items on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 due to rounding (in thousands, except per share data).

Our third and fourth quarters, which include the back to school and Christmas season, have historically generated a significant portion of our annual 56 Table of Contents operating income. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers. We currently believe that our inventory levels at those of our largest customers in the U.S. which we have sufficient information to form an opinion were near their targeted inventory levels at the end of fiscal year 2010. As we expand our retail store base and e commerce businesses, sales from our Direct to Consumer segment may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of sales in our Direct to Consumer segment, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays and the mix of products sold by us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso as compared to the U.S. dollar. Due to our vertical nature whereby a significant portion of goods are sourced from our owned facilities, the foreign currency risks relate primarily to the necessary current settlement of intercompany inventory transactions. We employ a variety of operating practices to manage these market risks relative to foreign currency exchange rate changes and, where deemed appropriate, utilize foreign currency forward contracts. These operating practices include, among others, our ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars at spot rates and to maintain U.S. dollar pricing relative to sales of our products to certain distributors located outside the U.S. The use of foreign currency forward contracts allows us to offset exposure to rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. We use derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and do not use them for speculation or for trading. There were no significant changes in how we managed foreign currency transactional exposure in fiscal year 2010 and management does not anticipate any significant changes in such exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposure in the near future. At January 1, 2011, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell 96.9 million Euro for approximately $126.2 million, expiring through April 2012, 4.1 billion Japanese Yen for approximately $46.9 million, expiring through December 2012, 15.7 million British Pounds for approximately $25.0 million, expiring through April 2012, 22.3 million Australian Dollars for approximately $19.6 million, expiring through May 2012, 33.7 million Mexican Pesos for approximately $2.6 million, expiring through June 2011 and 10.1 million Canadian Dollars for approximately $9.9 million, expiring through December 2011. If we were to settle our Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar based contracts at fiscal year end 2010, the net result would be a net loss of approximately $6.1 million, net of taxes. At fiscal year end 2010, a 10% unfavorable change in the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies to which we have balance sheet transactional exposures would have reduced net pre tax income by $13.4 million. The translation of the balance sheets of our foreign based operations from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At fiscal year end 2010, a 10% unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the foreign currencies to which we have exposure would have reduced consolidated stockholders equity by approximately $34.9 million. In the view of management, these hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 57 Table of Contents
