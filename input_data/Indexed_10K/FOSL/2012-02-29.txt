Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The words may, believes, expects, plans, intends, anticipates and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. The actual results of the future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from those stated in such forward looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including those discussed below. Accordingly, readers of this Annual Report on Form 10 K should consider these factors in evaluating, and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on, the forward looking statements contained herein. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business The deterioration in the global economic environment, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have an adverse effect on our operating results. The global economic environment has been challenging during the past several years. Declining real estate values, reduced lending by banks, solvency concerns of major financial institutions and certain foreign countries, increases in unemployment levels and significant volatility in the global financial markets have negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This has affected our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. In certain countries in which we distribute our products, we experienced a significant slowdown in customer traffic and a highly promotional environment during late 2008 and most of 2009. Although we have experienced a slight improvement in the overall economy recently, if the economy deteriorates or slides back into a recession, there could likely be a negative effect on our revenues and earnings across most of our segments for fiscal year 2012. The effects of economic cycles, terrorism, acts of war and retail industry conditions may adversely affect our business. Our business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war and military action both in the U.S. and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to procure our products from manufacturers for sale to our customers. Any significant declines in general economic conditions, public safety concerns or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on consumer purchases of our products. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image, marketing programs and product design. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences in a timely manner while preserving the authenticity and the quality of our brands. Although we attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends affecting accessories and clothing, any failure by us to identify and respond to such trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our existing brand names and product lines, which 24 in turn could adversely affect sales of our products. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The loss of any of our license agreements, pursuant to which a number of our products are produced, may result in the loss of significant revenues and may adversely affect our business. A significant portion of our growth in sales and net income is, and is expected to continue to be, derived from the sales of products produced under license agreements with third parties. Under these license agreements, we generally have the right to produce, market and distribute certain products utilizing the brand names of other companies. We sell products under certain licensed brands, including, but not limited to, ADIDAS, ARMANI EXCHANGE, BURBERRY, DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, MARC BY MARC JACOBS and MICHAEL KORS. Sales of our licensed products amounted to 44.7% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2011, with certain individual licensed brands accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. Our material license agreements have various expiration dates between 2013 and 2017. In addition, certain license agreements may require us to make minimum royalty payments, subject us to restrictive covenants or require us to comply with certain other obligations and may be terminated by the licensor if these or other conditions are not met or upon certain events. We may not be able to continue to meet our obligations or fulfill the conditions under these agreements in the future. In addition, we may be unable to renew our existing license agreements beyond the current term or obtain new license agreements to replace any lost license agreements on similar economic terms or at all. The failure by us to maintain or renew one or more of our existing material license agreements could result in a significant decrease in our sales and have a material adverse affect on our results of operations. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. We and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be readily available. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers control, such as natural disasters like the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In addition, the purchase of these components on a limited source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems. An increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower gross margins. In the event that we can no longer obtain materials from these limited sources of supply, we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a limited source or delay in transitioning to a replacement supplier could disrupt our operations and significantly harm our business in any given period. If our supply of certain components is disrupted, our lead times are extended or the cost of our components increases, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially affected. Our success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products. Our success also depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products in the respective markets in which we compete. If we are unable to successfully introduce new products, or if our competitors introduce superior products, customers may purchase increasing amounts of products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 25 We are subject to laws and regulations in the many countries in which we operate. Violations of laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, product safety, e commerce, promotions, intellectual property, tax, import and export, anti corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation, data privacy, anti competition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these numerous laws and regulations is complicated, time consuming and expensive, and the laws and regulations may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the difficulty of, and cost to, comply with them. New laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, could individually or in the aggregate make our products more costly to produce, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, cause us to change or limit our business practices, or affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the numerous laws and regulations affecting our business, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws, regulations or our policies related thereto. Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. Reduced lending by banks could have a negative impact on our customers, suppliers and business partners, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. The reduction in lending by banks is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. Although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our U.S. credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future, the impact of reduced lending on our customers, business partners and suppliers cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. The inability of our manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet delivery date requirements. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers, distributors or licensees to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and liquidity. Seasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal cycles, the timing of new product introductions, the timing of orders by our customers and the mix of product sales demand. Our business is seasonal by nature. A significant portion of our net sales and operating income are generated during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which includes the back to school and Christmas seasons. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal fourth quarter depends upon the anticipated level of retail sales during the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In addition, the amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal first quarter depends in part upon the actual level of retail sales during the Christmas season. The seasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect our business. Our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. Our customers also have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Personal information is highly regulated at the international, federal and state level. If we experience a significant breach of customer or employee data it could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage the Companys customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. 26 Our plan to significantly increase our store base may not be successful, and implementation of this plan may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could impact our competitive position. Each year, we have historically expanded our store base. During fiscal year 2012, we intend to further expand our store base by opening approximately 70 to 75 new stores globally and close approximately 18 stores. Thereafter, in the near term, we plan to continue to expand our store base annually. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to open new stores and renew our existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to open new stores on schedule or at all, to renew existing store leases on favorable terms or to operate them on a profitable basis will depend on various factors, including our ability to: identify suitable markets for new stores and available store locations; negotiate acceptable lease terms for new locations or renewal terms for existing locations; manage and expand our infrastructure to accommodate growth; hire and train qualified sales associates; develop new merchandise and manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis; foster current relationships and develop new relationships with vendors that are capable of supplying a greater volume of merchandise; and avoid construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build out of new stores. Our plans to expand our store base may not be successful and the implementation of these plans may not result in an increase in our net sales even though they increase our costs. Additionally, implementing our plans to expand our store base will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. The increased demands of operating additional stores could cause us to operate less effectively, which could cause the performance of our existing stores and our wholesale operations to suffer materially. Any of these outcomes of our attempted expansion of our store base could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our financial condition and results of operations. We have key facilities in the U.S. and overseas, the loss or shut down of any of which could harm our business. Our administrative and distribution operations in the U.S. are conducted primarily from two separate facilities located in the Dallas, Texas area. Our operations internationally are conducted from various administrative, distribution and assembly facilities outside of the U.S., particularly in China, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland. The complete or temporary loss of use of all or part of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our warehouse and distribution facilities in the Dallas, Texas area are operated in a special purpose sub zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. Although the sub zone allows us certain tax advantages, the sub zone is highly regulated by the U.S. Customs Service. This level of regulation may cause disruptions or delays in the distribution of our products out of these facilities. Under some circumstances, the U.S. Customs Service has the right to shut down the entire sub zone and, therefore, our entire warehouse and distribution facilities. During the time that the sub zone is shut down, we may be unable to adequately meet the supply requests of our customers and our Company owned retail stores, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, relationships with our customers, and results of operations, especially if the shutdown were to occur during our third or fourth quarter. 27 Our ability to grow our sales is dependent upon the implementation of our growth strategy, which we may not be able to achieve. Since our public offering in 1993, we have experienced substantial growth in net sales. Our ability to continue this growth is dependent on the successful implementation of our business strategy. This includes diversification of our product offerings, expansion of our Company owned accessory locations and strategic acquisitions. If we are not successful in the expansion of our product offerings or our new products are not profitable or do not generate sales comparable to those of our existing businesses, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Another element of our business strategy is to place increased emphasis on growth in selected international markets. If our brand names and products do not achieve a high degree of consumer acceptance in these markets, our net sales could be adversely affected. We also operate FOSSIL brand stores and other non FOSSIL branded stores and have historically expanded our Company owned accessory and outlet locations to further strengthen our brand image. As of December 31, 2011, we operated 398 stores worldwide. The costs associated with leasehold improvements to current stores and the costs associated with opening new stores could materially increase our costs of operation. We have recently expanded and intend to further expand the scope of our product offerings, and new products introduced by us may not achieve consumer acceptance comparable to that of our existing product lines. We have recently expanded and intend to further expand the scope of our product offerings. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. If trends shift away from our products, or if we misjudge the market for our product lines, we may be faced with significant amounts of unsold inventory or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The failure of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance could also adversely affect our business and the image of our brands. Achieving market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to generate consumer demand. These requirements could strain our management, financial and operational resources. If we do not continue to develop innovative products that provide better design and performance attributes than the products of our competitors and that are accepted by consumers, or if our future product lines misjudge consumer demands, we may lose consumer loyalty, which could result in a decline in our sales and market share. Our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels. We maintain an inventory of selected products that we anticipate will be in high demand. We may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs or the sale of excess inventory at prices below our standard levels. These events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues, any of which could harm our business. Our license agreements may require minimum royalty commitments regardless of the level of product sales under these agreements. Under our license agreements, we have in the past experienced, and could again in the future experience, instances where our minimum royalty commitments exceeded the royalties payable based upon our sales of the licensed products. We incurred royalty expense of approximately $160.2 million, $109.4 million and $73.9 28 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also have agreements in effect at the end of fiscal year 2011 which expire on various dates between fiscal years 2013 and 2017 that require us to pay royalties ranging from 4% to 20% of defined net sales. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or ability to meet our customers demands. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including natural resources, increased freight costs, increased labor costs, especially in China, and weather conditions. In the future, we may not be able to pass on, all or a portion of, such higher raw materials prices to our customers. We rely on third party assembly factories and manufacturers and problems with, or loss of, our assembly factories or manufacturing sources could harm our business and results of operations. The majority of our watch products are currently assembled, and a majority of our jewelry products are manufactured, to our specifications by our majority owned entities in China with the remainder assembled or manufactured by independent entities. All of our clothing, shoes, sunglasses, handbags, small leather goods, belts and soft accessories are produced by independent manufacturers. We have no long term contracts with these independent assembly factories or manufacturers and compete with other companies for production facilities. All transactions between us and our independent assembly factories or manufacturers are conducted on the basis of purchase orders. We face the risk that these independent assembly factories or manufacturers may not produce and deliver our products on a timely basis, or at all. As a result, we cannot be certain that these assembly factories or manufacturers will continue to assemble or manufacture products for us or that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, shortages of raw materials, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain close relationships with our current independent assembly factories and manufacturers and to develop long term relationships with other manufacturers that satisfy our requirements for price, quality and production flexibility. Our ability to establish new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery. Any failure by us to maintain long term relationships with our current assembly factories and manufacturers or to develop relationships with other manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. If an independent manufacturer or license partner of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer. We have no control over the ultimate actions or labor practices of our independent manufacturers. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers, or by one of our license partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturers or license partners labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other countries in which the violation or divergence occurred, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers or licensors be found in violation of state or international labor laws, we could suffer financial or other unforeseen consequences. 29 We extend unsecured credit to our customers and are therefore vulnerable to any financial difficulties they may face. We sell our merchandise primarily to department stores and specialty retail stores worldwide. We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customers financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. Should any of our larger customers experience financial difficulties, we could curtail business with such customers or assume more credit risk relating to such customers receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable relating to such customers could have a material adverse effect on the amount of sales revenue that we receive and our financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain long term contracts with our customers and are unable to control their purchasing decisions. We do not maintain long term purchasing contracts with our customers and therefore have no contractual leverage over their purchasing decisions. A decision by a major department store or other significant customer to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating strategy. Our Direct to consumer business segment operates in the highly competitive specialty retail, e commerce and catalog industry and the size and resources of some of our competitors are substantially greater than ours, which may allow them to compete more effectively. We face intense competition in the specialty retail, e commerce and catalog industry. We compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores, catalog retailers and internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of watches, accessories and clothing. We believe that the principal basis upon which we compete is the quality and design of merchandise and the quality of customer service. We also believe that price is an important factor in our customers decision making processes. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and generate greater national brand recognition than we can. This intense competition and greater size and resources of some of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our results of operations. We could be negatively impacted if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire. As part of our growth strategy, we have made certain acquisitions, domestically and internationally, including acquisitions of FOSSIL stores previously operated under license agreements, acquisitions of certain watch brands and acquisitions of independent distributors of our products. On January 10, 2012, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to acquire Skagen Designs and certain of its international affiliates. Skagen Designs, based in Reno, Nevada, manufactures, markets and distributes watches, jewelry, sunglasses and clocks. The potential integration of Skagen Designs, when and if the transaction closes, and future acquisitions may not be successful or generate sales increases. When we have acquired businesses, we have acquired businesses that we believe could enhance our business opportunities and our growth prospects. All acquisitions involve risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risks include: distraction of management from our business operations; loss of key personnel and other employees; costs, delays, and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations and personnel; the impairment of acquired assets and goodwill; and acquiring the contingent and other liabilities of the businesses we acquire. 30 In addition, acquired businesses may not provide us with increased business opportunities or result in the growth that we anticipate. Furthermore, integrating acquired operations is a complex, time consuming and expensive process. Combining acquired operations with our current operations may result in lower overall operating margins, greater stock price volatility and quarterly earnings fluctuations. Cultural incompatibilities, career uncertainties and other factors associated with such acquisitions may also result in the loss of employees. Failure to acquire and successfully integrate complementary practices, or failure to achieve the business synergies or other anticipated benefits, could materially affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations. Our competitors are established companies that may have greater experience than us in a number of crucial areas, including design and distribution. There is intense competition in each of the businesses in which we compete. In all of our businesses, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors who may have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. Our competitors include distributors that import watches, accessories and clothing from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories and clothing domestically. Our results of operations and market position may be adversely affected by our competitors and their competitive pressures in the watch, fashion accessory and clothing industries. Our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our computer system and divert management time. In 2003, we began implementing an enterprise resource planning system from SAP AG, a German software company. We implemented the SAP ERP system in our U.S., Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Switzerland locations in fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Over time, we intend to replace our existing enterprise resource planning systems and other principal financial systems in certain other subsidiaries with software systems provided by SAP AG. We have implemented Navision as our standard system throughout most of our Far East distribution and manufacturing subsidiary operations, including our principal Hong Kong office and China assembly facilities. Our current expansion plans may place significant strain on our management, working capital, financial and management control systems and staff. The failure to maintain or upgrade financial and management control systems, to recruit additional staff or to respond effectively to difficulties encountered during expansion could have a material adverse effect on our ability to respond to trends in our target markets, market our products and meet our customers requirements. The sustained disruption or failure of our systems due to force majeure or as part of an upgrade, conversion or other systems maintenance could result in the same adverse effects. Changes in the mix of product sales demand could negatively impact our gross profit margins. Our gross profit margins are impacted by our sales mix. Sales from our Direct to consumer segment and international and licensed watch businesses generally provide gross margins in excess of our historical consolidated gross profit margin, while accessory products generally provide gross profit margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margin. If future sales from our Direct to consumer segment and international and licensed watch businesses do not increase at a faster rate than our accessory business, our gross profit margins may grow at a slower pace, cease to grow, or decrease relative to our historical consolidated gross profit margin. We also distribute private label product to the mass market channel at gross profit margins significantly lower than our historical consolidated gross profit margin. Future growth in this channel at rates in excess of our consolidated net sales growth rate could negatively impact our consolidated gross profit margins. Our industry is subject to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our financial performance. We assemble or source many of our products offshore because they generally cost less to make overseas, due primarily to lower labor costs. Many of our competitors also source their product requirements offshore to 31 achieve lower costs, possibly in locations with lower costs than our offshore operations, and those competitors may use these cost savings to reduce prices. To remain competitive, we must adjust our prices from time to time in response to these industry wide pricing pressures. Our financial performance may be negatively affected by these pricing pressures if we are forced to reduce our prices and we cannot reduce our production costs or our production costs increase and we cannot increase our prices. The loss of our intellectual property rights may harm our business. Our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We are devoted to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights in those countries where we believe it is important to our ability to sell our products. However, we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken will result in enforceable rights, will be adequate to protect our products in every country where we may want to sell our products, will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to prevent sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, we rely on the patent, trademark and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. Even if we are successful in obtaining appropriate trademark, patent and other intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. Because we sell our products internationally and are dependent on foreign manufacturing in China, we are significantly dependent on foreign countries to protect our intellectual property rights. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail. The failure to obtain or maintain trademark, patent or other intellectual property rights could materially harm our business. Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling certain our products. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Moreover, we may need to redesign or rename some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain of our products. An increase in product returns could negatively impact our operating results. We accept limited returns and will request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We continually monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting credit returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. 32 There are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. In addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could in turn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital. Risk Factors Relating to Our International Operations Factors affecting international commerce and our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from outside of the U.S., and we anticipate that revenue from our international operations could account for an increasingly larger portion of our net sales in the future. Our international operations are directly related to, and dependent on, the volume of international trade and foreign market conditions. International commerce and our international operations are subject to many risks, some of which are discussed in more detail below, including: recessions in foreign economies; the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions; limitations on repatriation of earnings; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights under the laws of other countries; longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing foreign operations; social, political and economic instability; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 33 our ability to finance foreign operations; tariffs and other trade barriers; and U.S. government licensing requirements for exports. The occurrence or consequences of any of these risks may restrict our ability to operate in the affected regions and decrease the profitability of our international operations, which may seriously harm our financial condition. Foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition. We generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars. However, we source a significant amount of our products overseas and, as such, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Danish Krone, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso, Norwegian Kroner, Singapore Dollar, Swedish Krona, Swiss Franc and Taiwanese Dollar. Due to our dependence on manufacturing operations in China, changes in the value of the Chinese Yuan may have a material impact on our supply channels and manufacturing costs, including component and assembly costs. Changes in the currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Although we utilize forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risks (mostly relating to the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar), if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We depend on independent distributors to sell our products in certain international markets. Our products are sold in certain international markets through independent distributors. If a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor. If a change in our distributors becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, as well as a substantial disruption in, and a resulting loss of, sales and profits. Because we are dependent on foreign manufacturing, we are vulnerable to changes in economic and social conditions in Asia and disruptions in international travel and shipping. Because a substantial portion of our watches and certain of our handbags, sunglasses and other products are assembled or manufactured in China, our success will depend to a significant extent upon future economic and social conditions existing in China. If the factories in China were disrupted for any reason, we would need to arrange for the manufacture and shipment of products by alternative sources. Because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery, we are unable to predict whether such new relationships would be on terms that we regard as satisfactory. Any significant disruption in our relationships with our manufacturing sources located in China would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. Restrictions on travel to and from this and other regions, similar to those imposed during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, commonly known as SARS, and any delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products on account of SARS or other syndromes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer deadlines and timely distribute our products in order to match consumer tastes. Risks associated with foreign government regulations and U.S. trade policy may affect our foreign operations and sourcing. Our businesses are subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which our manufacturing sources are located, primarily China. While 34 we have not experienced any material issues with foreign governmental regulations that would impact our arrangements with our foreign manufacturing sources, we believe that this issue is of particular concern with regard to China due to the less mature nature of the Chinese market economy and the historical involvement of the Chinese government in industry. If regulation were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable, or if our current foreign manufacturing sources were for any other reason to cease doing business with us, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and on our supply, manufacturing and distribution channels. Our business is also subject to the risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of most favored nation status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and financial condition. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to: quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the countries where our clothing producing facilities are located and foreign countries; and customs duties imposed by the governments where our clothing producing facilities are located on imported products, including raw materials. Our clothing business is also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization, referred to as the WTO. Generally, such trade agreements benefit our clothing business by reducing or eliminating the duties and or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country. However, trade agreements can also impose requirements that negatively impact our clothing business, such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials and setting quotas on products that may be imported into the U.S. from a particular country. In addition, the WTO may commence a new round of trade negotiations that liberalize textile trade. This increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock Many factors may cause our net sales, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate and possibly decline, which may result in declines in our stock price. Our net sales, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors may include, but may not be limited to, the following: fluctuations in market demand for our products; increased competition and pricing pressures; our ability to anticipate changing customer demands and preferences; 35 our failure to efficiently manage our inventory levels; our inability to manage and maintain our debt obligations; seasonality in our business; changes in our, and our competitors, business strategy or pricing; the successful expansion of our Company owned retail stores; the timing of certain general and administrative expenses; completing acquisitions and the costs of integrating acquired operations; international currency fluctuations, operating challenges and trade regulations; acts of terrorism or acts of war; and government regulation. One or more of the foregoing factors, as well as any other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, may cause our operating expenses to be unexpectedly high or result in a decrease in our net sales during any given period. If these or any other variables or unknowns were to cause a shortfall in revenues or earnings, an increase in our operating costs or otherwise cause a failure to meet public market expectations, our stock price may decline and our business could be adversely affected. Our CEO owns a significant amount of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Kosta Kartsotis, our CEO, owns approximately 10% of our common stock as of December 31, 2011. As a result, he is in a position to significantly influence the outcome of elections of our directors, the adoption, amendment or repeal of our bylaws and any other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, and to otherwise influence our affairs. Because the interests of Mr. Kartsotis may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders, Mr. Kartsotis may influence the Company to enter into transactions or agreements that other stockholders would not approve or make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree. Our organizational documents contain anti takeover provisions that could discourage a proposal for a takeover. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a proposal for a takeover. These include a provision in our certificate of incorporation authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock and provisions in our bylaws establishing advance notice procedures with respect to certain stockholder proposals. Our bylaws may be amended by a vote of 80% of the Board of Directors, subject to repeal by a vote of 80% of the stockholders. In addition, Delaware law limits the ability of a Delaware corporation to engage in certain business combinations with interested stockholders. Finally, Mr. Kartsotis has the ability, by virtue of his stock ownership, to significantly influence a vote regarding a change in control. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price. Mr. Kosta Kartsotis owns approximately 10% of our common stock as of December 31, 2011. The shares beneficially owned by Mr. Kosta Kartsotis may be sold in the open market in the future, subject to any volume restrictions and other limitations under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 144 thereunder. We may also decide to file a registration statement enabling Mr. Kartsotis to sell additional shares. Any sales by Mr. Kartsotis of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of his shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales could 36 occur. These sales or the possibility that they may occur also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in any equity offering in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Company facilities. As of the end of fiscal year 2011, we owned or leased the following material facilities in connection with our U.S. and international operations: Location Use Square Footage Owned / Leased Dallas, Texas Office, warehouse and distribution 517,500 Owned Eggst&auml;tt, Germany Office, warehouse and distribution 260,000 Owned Grabenstatt, Germany Office 92,160 Owned Basel, Switzerland European headquarters 35,000 Owned Richardson, Texas Corporate headquarters 535,731 Lease expiring in 2021 Hong Kong Far East headquarters, warehouse and distribution 191,986 Lease expiring in 2014 Garland, Texas Warehouse 268,706 Lease expiring in 2017 Shenzhen, China Manufacturing 110,231 Lease expiring in 2013 New York, New York General office and showroom 26,552 Lease expiring in 2016 In 2011, we entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters building in Richardson, Texas. In a related transaction, we sold two office buildings that were previously used as our corporate headquarters comprising approximately 190,000 and 132,000 square feet, respectively, and one of our warehouses comprising approximately 138,000 square feet, all located in Richardson, Texas. We also lease certain other manufacturing and or office, warehouse and or distribution facilities in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Australia; Austria; Canada; France; India; Italy; Japan; Malaysia; Mexico; the Netherlands; New Zealand; Singapore; South Korea; Sweden; Switzerland; Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Retail store facilities. As of the end of fiscal year 2011, we had 420 lease agreements for retail space for the sale of our products. The leases, including renewal options, expire at various times from 2012 to 2024. The leases provide for minimum annual rentals and, in certain cases, for the payment of additional rent when sales exceed specified net sales amounts. We are also generally required to pay our pro rata share of common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance expenses and utilities. We believe that our material existing facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition, and are adequate for our needs. Item 3. Legal Proceedings There are no legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which our properties are subject, other than routine litigation incidental to our business, which is not material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We do not believe that the outcome of any currently pending legal matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the Company. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 37 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities General. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FOSL. The following table sets forth the range of quarterly high and low sales prices per share of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011. High Low Fiscal year ended December 31, 2011: First quarter $ 94.77 $ 66.05 Second quarter 122.00 89.55 Third quarter 134.98 69.57 Fourth quarter 110.74 73.01 Fiscal year ended January 1, 2011: First quarter $ 39.60 $ 31.31 Second quarter 43.42 33.00 Third quarter 54.76 35.49 Fourth quarter 74.34 51.03 As of February 23, 2012, there were 116 holders of record of our shares of common stock (including nominee holders such as banks and brokerage firms who hold shares for beneficial owners), although we believe that the number of beneficial owners is much higher. Cash Dividend Policy. We did not pay any cash dividends in fiscal years 2011, 2010 or 2009. We expect that for the foreseeable future, we will retain all available earnings generated by our operations for the development and growth of our business. Any future determination as to a cash dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Common Stock Performance Graph The following performance graph compares the cumulative return of our shares of common stock over the preceding five year periods with that of the broad market (CRSP Total Return Index of the NASDAQ Global Select Market (US)) and the NASDAQ Retail Trades Group.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of mens and womens fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses, soft accessories, shoes and clothing. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company owned retail and factory outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL catalogs and website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macys, Dillards, JCPenney, Kohls, Sears, Wal Mart and Target. In the United States, our network of Company owned stores included 123 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 74 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 31, 2011. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products through our catalogs and on our website, www.fossil.com, as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites. Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in over 120 countries worldwide through 22 Company owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of over 60 independent distributors. Our products are distributed in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Central and South America, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, and the Middle East. Our products are offered on airlines and cruise ships and in international Company owned retail stores, which included 171 retail stores and 30 outlet stores in select international markets as of December 31, 2011. Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers control, such as natural disasters like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that occurred during fiscal year 2011. As a result of these natural disasters, we experienced an increase in the cost of movements that negatively impacted gross profit margin in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. We do not expect material changes in movement costs during fiscal year 2012. Effective January 3, 2010, we made changes to the presentation of reportable segments to reflect changes in the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. Prior to January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consisted of the following: United States wholesale, Europe wholesale, Other International wholesale and Direct to consumer. Effective January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consist of the following: North America wholesale, Europe wholesale, Asia Pacific wholesale and Direct to consumer. These changes included the reclassification of our wholesale operations in Canada and Mexico and our U.S. export business, all of which were previously recorded within our 41 Other International wholesale segment, to the North America wholesale segment. Our U.S. domestic wholesale operations previously recorded within the United States wholesale segment, were also reclassified to the North America wholesale segment. Our Asia Pacific wholesale operations, previously recorded within the Other International wholesale segment, were reclassified to the Asia Pacific wholesale segment. Our operations related to our joint venture with Fossil Spain, S.A., previously recorded within the Other International wholesale segment, were reclassified to the Europe wholesale segment. For comparison purposes, our historical segment disclosures were recast to be consistent with the current presentation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation reserves and stock based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments. Product Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. Bad Debt. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified. Additionally, we secure credit insurance policies in certain countries. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future credit losses may differ from those experienced in the past. Our bad debt allowance has increased over the last three fiscal years due to the challenging global economic environment. As a result of the difficult economic environment, some of our domestic and international customers have experienced financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. We increased our bad debt allowance to reserve for these bankruptcies, as well as increased risks of non payment and increased risk of customer charge backs. Our policy is to maintain the reserve balances for bankruptcies until such time as the bankruptcies are actually settled. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges, or market. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. 42 Long lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected discounted cash flows related to the asset. We apply Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, impairment losses are recorded in selling and distribution expenses. In addition, impairment losses resulting from property, plant and equipment in our corporate costs area are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses of $1.0 million, $5.6 million and $2.5 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Impairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. Additionally, if events or conditions were to indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable, we would evaluate goodwill for impairment at that time. We have three reporting units for which we evaluate goodwill for impairment, North America wholesale, Europe wholesale and Asia Pacific wholesale. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its recorded value, no impairment charge is recorded. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting units fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill may be incurred. We evaluate trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 98% of our total trade name balances at the end of both fiscal years 2011 and 2010. We performed the required annual impairment test and recorded no impairment charges in fiscal year 2011. We recorded impairment charges of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2010 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names and $2.7 million in fiscal year 2009 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 62%. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods. Income Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding unusual or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision 43 during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate excluding the impact of infrequent or unusual items. Warranty Costs. Our FOSSIL watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for a period of 11 years from the date of purchase. RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a comparable 12 year limited warranty, while all other watch brands sold in the U.S. are covered by a comparable two year limited warranty. Generally, all of our watch products sold in Canada, Europe and Asia are covered by a comparable two year limited warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The year end warranty liability for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $11.0 million, $8.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Hedge Accounting. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We have elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging for these hedges. Our objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risks primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, and are recognized in other (expense) income net in the period which approximates the time the hedged inventory is sold. Litigation Reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims that may arise, changes in the circumstances used to estimate amounts for prior period claims and favorable or unfavorable final settlements of prior period claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revise estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or circumstances change relative to prior claim assessments, revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation (ASC 718). We utilize the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (i) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), (ii) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and (iii) the number of options that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011 04, Fair Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04). FASB intends the new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amended guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 assets and liabilities for which we will be required to disclose quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements. These changes became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In June 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive 44 income and its components in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments in the update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. This amendment also required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011 05 (ASU 2011 12). ASU 2011 12 defers the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income while FASB further deliberates this aspect of the proposal. ASU 2011 05, as amended by ASU 2011 12, became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In September 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011 08). ASU 2011 08 simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment by allowing companies the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes from the qualitative assessment that impairment is more likely than not, the entity is required to perform the two step quantitative impairment test. These changes became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 08 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, (i) the percentages of our net sales represented by certain line items from our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and (ii) the percentage changes in these line items between the fiscal years indicated.

Consolidated Net Sales. We believe watch sales across all of our operating segments are benefiting from a resurgence in the watch category in general, resulting in consumers allocating more of their discretionary spending to this fashion category. We also believe our results are outpacing those of our competitors as consumers respond positively to our innovative product offerings and focused presentations at retail. We attribute this favorable consumer response to our designs, which incorporate newer materials into the construction of the watch while also maintaining a very strong price to value relationship. With respect to the FOSSIL brand, we have followed a strategy of focusing our marketing efforts on point of sale presentations, as well as our catalog and web based marketing initiatives and the growth of our FOSSIL store and e commerce footprint. We believe these strategies are clearly communicating the aspirational lifestyle image of the brand and are resonating strongly with consumers around the world. Net sales of FOSSIL branded products increased by 17.3% during fiscal year 2011. North America Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in the North America wholesale segment rose 24.1%, or $187.4 million, during fiscal year 2011, including double digit sales growth across all major product categories. Watch sales increased 29.5%, or $162.7 million, representing broad based growth across brands. Licensed brand watch sales were led by sales volume increases in MICHAEL KORS of $83.1 million, DIESEL of $14.3 million, ARMANI EXCHANGE of $11.8 million, MARC BY MARC JACOBS of $10.8 million, BURBERRY of $8.5 million and EMPORIO ARMANI of $8.2 million. Additionally, FOSSIL and RELIC watch sales volumes increased $16.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by sales volume 46 declines of $4.5 million in our mass market business. Shipments to third party distributors, located primarily in South America, increased by 47.9%, or $36.9 million, during fiscal year 2011. MICHAEL KORS sales volume increases were primarily attributable to increased case space allocated by retailers in the department store channel as a result of strong sell through rates and door expansion in MICHAEL KORS boutiques. DIESEL, ARMANI EXCHANGE and EMPORIO ARMANI sales volume increases were principally driven by increased doors with existing customers in the department store channel. DIESEL sales volumes also benefitted from a shift in the sales mix to higher price points. Increases in MARC BY MARC JACOBS and BURBERRY were primarily a result of increased sell through rates with existing customers in the department store channel. We believe the RELIC sales volumes were favorably impacted by an upward trend in the overall fashion watch category in the mid tier department store channel. Decreased sales volumes in our mass market distribution channel were principally driven by retailers destocking inventory levels. The leather and jewelry categories also contributed to the sales volume growth in North America during fiscal year 2011, increasing 11.5%, or $19.7 million, and 24.0%, or $5.4 million, respectively. Growth in the leathers business was primarily attributable to FOSSIL womens and mens leather sales volume increases of $14.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The FOSSIL leathers business was favorably impacted by increased sell through rates at retail and increased average unit retail prices as a result of introducing a growing selection of higher quality details and fabrications in our leather products. Increases in the jewelry category were primarily the result of the launch of MICHAEL KORS jewelry during fiscal year 2011, which contributed $6.4 million, partially offset by a sales volume decline of $2.4 million in FOSSIL accessory jewelry as a result of lower sell through rates in fiscal year 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. Europe wholesale net sales rose 21.9%, or $119.9 million, during fiscal year 2011, primarily as a result of a 22.7%, or $90.0 million, increase in watch shipments. All key markets and major watch brands experienced growth, with the greatest gains delivered by MICHAEL KORS of $23.5 million, FOSSIL of $21.5 million, DKNY of $11.2 million, DIESEL of $10.0 million and EMPORIO ARMANI and BURBERRY of $8.9 million each. Sales growth in MICHAEL KORS primarily resulted from increased door growth in the region as well as the continuing brand building initiatives by the licensor. We believe the growth in all of our other watch brands was a result of consumers positive response to our focused and innovative designs, lifestyle brand imaging and the strong price to value relationship of our product offerings in comparison to our competitors in the region. The leather and jewelry businesses also favorably impacted fiscal year 2011 by increasing 71.8%, or $19.0 million, and 11.0%, or $11.2 million, respectively. The leather business continues to expand in Europe as a result of the increased FOSSIL brand awareness generated from the growing number of retail stores and websites launched in key markets. Additionally, during fiscal year 2011, sales to third party distributors, located primarily in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, rose 40.3%, or $35.1 million, as a result of increased brand awareness and higher sell through rates. Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. In fiscal year 2011, Asia Pacific wholesale net sales increased 27.8%, or $61.4 million. This increase was principally attributable to increases in our watch and leather categories of 32.1%, or $61.0 million, and 36.2%, or $4.6 million, respectively. These sales volume gains were partially offset by a 42.9%, or $5.2 million, decrease in jewelry sales volumes primarily as a result of discontinuing a non strategic, local jewelry brand in India. Our business model in Asia is focused on expanding our concessions model across key markets while exploring opportunities to further advance the FOSSIL brand across the region. Combined sales volumes in our strategic markets of China, Korea and Japan increased 39.7% during fiscal year 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. At the end of fiscal year 2011, we operated 213 concession locations in Asia with a net 52 new concessions opened during the last twelve months. For the 2011 fiscal year, concession sales increased by 74.1% with comparable store sales growing 24.1% in comparison to the prior fiscal year. These concessions represent a large opportunity for us in that they allow us to control the brand presentation and customer experience at the point of sale and capture the full retail price. We believe our diverse global distribution network, including owned distribution in 22 countries, combined with our design and marketing capabilities, will allow us to continue to take shelf space from lesser known local 47 and regional brands as we continue to increase brand awareness through the growth of our retail stores and introduction of new websites in many of the countries in which we operate. We also believe that investments we have made in certain emerging markets will allow us to experience higher levels of growth in our international wholesale segments in comparison to our North America wholesale segment. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to consumer net sales increased 23.6%, or $113.8 million, during fiscal year 2011, principally the result of comparable store sales increases of 17.4% and a 6.1% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year. The emphasis we have placed upon engaging our customers within our redesigned store environment and the focus on our proven selling metrics has improved store productivity. During fiscal year 2011, comparable store sales related to our global full price accessory concept increased by 11.5%, while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 26.2%. Additionally, our Direct to consumer segment was favorably impacted in fiscal year 2011 by $5.0 million of additional e commerce sales, primarily driven by our U.S., Germany and U.K. based e commerce businesses. In December, our most productive month for e commerce, our e commerce business increased by 11.7% in 2011 as compared to December 2010. We ended fiscal year 2011 with 398 stores, including 245 full price accessory stores, 142 of which were outside of North America, 104 outlet locations, including 29 outside of North America, 36 clothing stores, including 4 outside of North America, and 13 full price multi brand stores, including 11 outside of North America. This compares to 364 stores at the end of fiscal year 2010, including 230 full price accessory stores, 127 of which were outside of North America, 93 outlet locations, including 22 outside of North America, 31 clothing stores, including 3 outside of North America, and 10 full price multi brand stores, including 9 outside of North America. During fiscal year 2011, we opened 51 new stores and closed 17 stores. During fiscal year 2012, we anticipate opening approximately 70 to 75 additional retail stores and closing approximately 18 stores globally. A store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and or relocation. During 2006, we entered into an agreement with the House of Fraser, a U.K. based department store (HOF), which allows us to operate the watch department in certain HOF stores. Under this agreement, we own the inventory within the HOF store, provide the labor to operate the department and pay HOF a commission on the retail watch sales generated in the stores. Although we include the net sales derived from the HOF stores in our Direct to consumer segment, we do not include the number of locations associated with this agreement in our retail store count or in our comparable store sales. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2011 represented an increase of 24.6% in comparison to $1.2 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net sales partially offset by a reduction in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 56.1% in fiscal year 2011 compared to 56.9% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by increased production costs, lower margin sales to off price retailers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the sales mix of lower margin sales to third party distributors. Partially offsetting these declines in gross profit margin was an increase in the mix of sales of higher margin watch products in comparison to leather products, including a greater mix of higher margin licensed watch brands in fiscal year 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Additionally, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar during fiscal year 2011 in comparison to the prior fiscal year benefitted gross profit margin by approximately 180 basis points. Our consolidated gross profit margin is also impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses, and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch, jewelry and sunglass 48 offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods categories. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. From a segment standpoint, our Direct to consumer business generally produces the highest gross profit margin as a result of these sales being direct to the ultimate consumer. Gross profit margins related to sales in our international wholesale segments are historically lower than our Direct to consumer segment, but historically higher than our North America wholesale segment primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S., (ii) the product sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 37.7% in fiscal year 2011 compared to 38.3% in the prior fiscal year. Total operating expenses in fiscal year 2011 increased by $188.4 million, primarily as a result of increased sales. The translation of foreign based expenses in fiscal year 2011 increased operating expenses by $23.3 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar, in comparison to the prior fiscal year. Excluding currency effects, fiscal year 2011 operating expenses in our wholesale segments, Direct to consumer segment and corporate cost areas increased by $76.9 million, $57.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively, as compared to the prior fiscal year. A majority of the expense growth in the wholesale segments was related to ongoing investments in the Asia region. Expense growth in other regions was primarily related to increased compensation costs and marketing expenses. Expense increases in the Direct to consumer segment were primarily attributable to store growth, increased web based marketing expenditures, expansion of our catalog costs and costs associated with the launch and ongoing expenses of our customer relationship management initiative. Expense growth in the corporate cost area was primarily attributable to increased payroll costs due to headcount additions and incentive and equity based compensation, and operating costs and incurring expenses to move into our new corporate headquarters. In addition, fiscal year 2010 included a non cash charge of approximately $3.7 million related to an other than temporary fixed asset impairment. The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America wholesale $ 165.4 17.1 % $ 146.3 18.8 % Europe wholesale 199.2 28.6 164.1 30.0 Asia Pacific wholesale 134.1 45.2 96.1 43.5 Direct to consumer 322.7 53.1 258.2 53.4 Corporate 145.8 114.1 Total $ 967.2 37.7 % $ 778.8 38.3 % Operating Income. Operating income increased $95.6 million, or 25.4%, in fiscal year 2011. As a percentage of net sales, operating income decreased slightly to 18.4% of net sales in fiscal year 2011 compared to 18.5% of net sales in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a decrease in gross profit margin, partially offset by 60 basis points of operating expense leverage. During fiscal year 2011, operating income was positively impacted by approximately $39.2 million as a result of the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $1.3 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily driven by increased participation by our Asia Pacific subsidiaries in our intercompany cash pool at interest rates in excess of those earned on cash deposits by our European subsidiaries participating in the pool. 49 Other (Expense) Income Net. Other (expense) income net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from mark to market, hedging and other transactional activities, and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2011, other (expense) income net changed unfavorably by approximately $27.0 million, primarily driven by net foreign currency transaction losses of $20.7 million in fiscal year 2011, as compared to net foreign currency transaction gains of $5.2 million in fiscal year 2010. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 was $144.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.9%, compared to 31.1% in fiscal year 2010. Fiscal year 2011 income tax expense was positively impacted due to certain tax provision offsets carrying a higher effective tax rate. Fiscal year 2010 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits during the fiscal year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which represents the minority interest portion of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100%, increased $3.0 million for fiscal year 2011. This increase was primarily a result of increased net income related to our less than 100% owned watch assembly facilities. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2011 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 15.5% to $294.7 million, or $4.61 per diluted share, in comparison to $255.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. for fiscal year 2011 included net foreign currency gains of $0.14 per diluted share and a $0.26 per diluted share benefit as a result of a 5.5% lower outstanding share count related to our ongoing stock repurchase program. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Net Sales. The following table illustrates by factor the total year over year percentage change in net sales by segment and on a consolidated basis: Exchange Rates Organic Change Total Change North America wholesale 0.7 % 40.7 % 41.4 % Europe wholesale (5.6 ) 22.8 17.2 Asia Pacific wholesale 8.6 35.0 43.6 Direct to consumer (0.5 ) 29.0 28.5 Consolidated (0.7 )% 31.9 % 31.2 % The following net sales discussion excludes the impact on sales growth attributable to foreign currency rate changes as noted in the above table. North America Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in the North America wholesale segment, which consists of our operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and sales to third party distributors in South America, increased 40.7%, or $224.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. We attribute this increase to consumers positive reactions to our innovative product offerings and an upward trend in the fashion watch category. These favorable watch sales trends have prompted retailers to place greater emphasis on the category by increasing staff to service the watch customer, increasing open to buy dollars and expanding marketing initiatives, thereby further accelerating net sales. The increased sell through rates of our watch products at our retailers have also resulted in these customers restocking inventories during fiscal year 2010, after heavily destocking inventory levels in fiscal year 2009 due to the economic downturn. Additionally, our customers have been increasing the level of inventories in certain situations, including allocating additional retail space within their stores, to meet the increased demand for our watch products. As a result of the acceleration in sales in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to the destocking activity in fiscal year 2009, North American wholesale watch shipments increased by 60.9%, or $207.9 million, in fiscal year 2010. Licensed brands, FOSSIL and MICHELE represented the strongest net sales contributions, 50 increasing by 113.9%, 35.4% and 49.7%, respectively. Licensed brand watch sales were primarily led by sales volume increases in MICHAEL KORS of 218.4%, or $95.5 million, and, to a lesser extent, increases in EMPORIO ARMANI of 48.8%, DIESEL of 61.0%, DKNY of 46.8% and MARC BY MARC JACOBS of 61.0%. In addition, our RELIC watch business increased 20.8% during fiscal year 2010. MICHAEL KORS sales volumes were principally driven by innovative designs, increased sell through rates at retail and additional case space allocated by retailers in the department store channel. Our accessories business, which includes our mens and womens leather, jewelry, and other non watch categories, also contributed to the growth in North America as net sales volumes increased 7.9%, or $16.5 million, in fiscal year 2010. This increase was primarily a result of sales volume growth in FOSSIL accessory jewelry, shoes, womens small leathers, and sunglasses which had sales increases of 67.6%, 122.2%, 27.2% and 3.6%, respectively. Both our accessory jewelry and shoes categories were launched into the department store channel in the last two years and are still experiencing both door growth and, in some cases, assortment expansion. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of 2.6% and 3.8% in womens bags and mens leather products, respectively. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in our Europe wholesale segment increased 22.8%, or $106.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2010, our Europe wholesale segment benefited from a similar level of increased consumer response to new designs as we experienced in the North America wholesale segment. Additionally, Europe wholesale net sales increases in fiscal year 2010 benefited from similar de stocking activities to that experienced in our North America wholesale segment, primarily during the last nine months of fiscal year 2009. Watch sales experienced the most significant growth, increasing 23.3%, or $78.5 million. All major watch brands contributed to this growth with increases of 19.7% in FOSSIL, 24.3% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 101.3% in MICHAEL KORS, 26.6% in DIESEL and 18.2% in DKNY representing the strongest performances. During fiscal year 2010, our jewelry and leather categories also delivered strong double digit increases of 21.0% and 46.7%, respectively. We believe net sales increases in our jewelry category were positively impacted by trends similar to those that we experienced in our watch business. We believe the growth experienced in our leather products business in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to expand our leather offerings in our wholesale channel by leveraging the increased brand awareness generated by the expansion of our FOSSIL accessory store concept in the region over the last two years. In addition, shipments to third party distributors increased 45.4% in fiscal year 2010, which we believe was principally related to increased sell through rates of our fashion watch offerings and to our distributors replenishing inventory during fiscal year 2010 in comparison to destocking inventory in the prior fiscal year. Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. In fiscal year 2010, Asia Pacific wholesale shipments increased 35.0%, or $53.8 million, primarily a result of a 39.6% increase in licensed brand watch sales and, to a lesser extent, increases of 19.4% in FOSSIL watches and 55.2% in leather products. Licensed brand watch sales were led by increases of 43.0% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 127.8% in MARC BY MARC JACOBS and 54.0% in BURBERRY. In addition to consumers responding favorably to new designs, we believe the growth in our watch business was due to the growth in our retail concession base across many of our markets within this segment, including the transition of our South Korean operations from a third party distributor to a Company owned subsidiary during the 2010 fiscal year. The net sales growth in the South Korea market represented 46.6% of the $53.8 million in net sales that we added within this segment in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to fiscal year 2009. The growth in the leather category in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to broaden distribution of the category by leveraging the FOSSIL brand awareness created from an expanded FOSSIL accessory store base in this region. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to consumer net sales increased 29.0%, or $108.9 million, during fiscal year 2010, principally the result of comparable store sales increases of 19.0% and a 5.9% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year. Additionally, our Direct to consumer segment was favorably impacted in fiscal year 2010 by growth of 50.2% in e commerce sales primarily driven by our U.S. and Germany based e commerce businesses. During fiscal year 2010, comparable store sales related to our global full 51 price accessory concept increased by 15.9%, while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 21.1%. We believe the growth in our Direct to consumer business was attributable to consumers positive response to the focused point of view and imagery of the FOSSIL brand, the continuous introduction of new and innovative designs and materials, increased catalog mailings and expanded e commerce marketing activities. We ended fiscal year 2010 with 364 stores, including 230 full price accessory stores, 127 of which were outside of North America, 93 outlet locations, including 22 outside of North America, 31 clothing stores, including 3 outside of North America, and 10 full price multi brand stores, including 9 outside of North America. This compares to 354 stores at the end of fiscal year 2009, including 218 full price accessory stores, 116 of which were outside of North America, 90 outlet locations, including 15 outside of North America, 33 clothing stores, all in North America, and 13 full price multi brand stores, including 11 outside of North America. During fiscal year 2010, we opened 33 new stores and closed 23 stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010 represented an increase of 36.7% in comparison to $844.9 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net sales and gross profit margin expansion. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points to 56.9% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 54.6% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit margin was principally driven by an increase in the mix of sales of higher margin watch products in comparison to leather products, including a greater mix of higher margin licensed watch brands, and higher gross margins experienced in outlet stores. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a combination of decreased component costs associated with some of the new materials we incorporated into our watch designs and higher retail prices. These increases in gross profit margin were partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points during fiscal year 2010, and increased input costs related to payroll as a result of wage increases across our China assembly operations and third party component manufacturers. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased $145.5 million to $778.8 million in fiscal year 2010. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 38.3% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 40.9% in the prior fiscal year and included a favorable impact of approximately $3.5 million related to the translation of foreign based expenses due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses in our wholesale segments, Direct to consumer segment and corporate cost areas increased by $78.9 million, $35.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2010. Expense growth in the wholesale segments was principally a result of increased marketing expenses and compensation costs. Expense increases in the Direct to consumer segment were primarily attributable to store growth, expansion of our catalog mailings and increased web based marketing expenditures. Expense growth in the corporate cost area was primarily associated with increased compensation costs, including a $3.8 million increase in equity compensation expense, and a non cash charge of approximately $3.7 million related to an other than temporary fixed asset impairment. The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America wholesale $ 146.3 18.8 % $ 118.9 21.6 % Europe wholesale 164.1 30.0 146.0 31.3 Asia Pacific wholesale 96.1 43.5 66.9 43.5 Direct to consumer 258.2 53.4 222.6 59.2 Corporate 114.1 78.8 Total $ 778.8 38.3 % $ 633.2 40.9 % 52 Operating Income. Operating income increased by 77.9% to $376.4 million in fiscal year 2010 compared to $211.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Operating income margin increased by 480 basis points to 18.5% of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 13.7% in the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of increased net sales, gross profit margin expansion and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating income included approximately $6.8 million of net currency losses in fiscal year 2010 related to the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $884,000 in fiscal year 2010, primarily driven by increased participation by our Asia Pacific subsidiaries in our intercompany cash pool at interest rates in excess of those earned on cash deposits by our European subsidiaries in the pool. Other (Expense) Income Net. Other (expense) income net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from mark to market, hedging and other transactional activities, and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2010, other (expense) income net changed favorably by approximately $409,000 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily driven by increased equity earnings of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain and increased interest income, partially offset by decreased net foreign currency transaction gains. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal 2010 was $119.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.1%, compared to 34.4% in fiscal year 2009. Fiscal year 2010 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits during the fiscal year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which represents the minority interest portion of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100%, increased $4.6 million for fiscal year 2010. This increase is a result of increased net income related to our less than 100% wholly owned subsidiaries with a substantial portion of this increase attributable to the net income related to one of our watch assembly facilities. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2010 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 83.4% to $255.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in comparison to $139.2 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2010 earnings per diluted share of $3.77 included an approximate $0.07 diluted earnings per share reduction related to foreign currency rate changes. Effects of Inflation Although inflation in raw materials and production costs have had a negative impact on our gross profit margins, we do not believe that inflation overall has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Substantial increases in costs in the future, however, could have a material impact on us and the industry. We believe that, to the extent inflation increases our costs in the future, we could generally offset that inflation over time by increasing prices, if competitive conditions permit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the second quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by the number of new stores we open, other capital expenditures, and the amount of any discretionary stock repurchases we make. 53 Net cash provided by operating activities of $251.3 million in fiscal year 2011 was more than offset by cash used in investing and financing activities of $110.1 million and $249.9 million respectively, resulting in a $105.3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents since the end of fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2011, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $307.4 million and favorable non cash activities of $91.4 million, partially offset by an unfavorable increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $147.5 million. During fiscal year 2011, cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by $109.9 million in capital expenditures. During fiscal year 2011, cash used in financing activities was principally comprised of $270.9 million of common stock repurchases. Foreign exchange rate translations increased cash and cash equivalents by $3.4 million during fiscal year 2011. As illustrated in the contractual obligations table below, we have approximately $ 2.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recorded as liabilities and could be settled in the next 12 months. Settlement of such amounts could require utilization of working capital. As of December 31, 2011, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $371.8 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If in the future we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur incremental U.S. federal and state income tax, reduced by allowable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to keep these funds indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and our current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Accounts receivable increased by 14.9% to $302.5 million during fiscal year 2011 compared to $263.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in wholesale shipments. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale segments for fiscal year 2011 was 46 days in comparison to 48 days in the prior fiscal year. Inventory at the end of fiscal year 2011 was $489.0 million, representing an increase of 31.5% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $371.9 million. An approximate five day reduction in lead times in watch shipments in December 2011 resulted in approximately $30 million of inventory receipts shifting from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. Additionally, given the natural disasters that occurred in Japan in early fiscal year 2011 and the concentration of our movement supply in that country, we have increased the level of inventory related to key watch component parts including those with longer lead times. In fiscal year 2010, our Board of Directors approved two common stock repurchase programs pursuant to which up to $30 million and $750 million, respectively, could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. Both of these repurchase programs are to be conducted pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The $750 million repurchase program has a termination date of December 2013 and the $30 million repurchase program has no termination date. We repurchased 3.1 million shares under the $750 million repurchase program during fiscal year 2010 at a cost of $179.2 million. During fiscal year 2011, we repurchased 3.1 million shares under the $750 million repurchase program at a cost of $270.9 million. We did not make any repurchases under the $30 million plan during fiscal year 2011. On February 16, 2012, we entered into a new $100 million 10b5 1 plan under the $750 million repurchase program. This new plan has a termination date of May 3, 2012. At the end of fiscal year 2011, we had working capital of $844.1 million compared to working capital of $801.3 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, we had approximately $9.0 million of outstanding short term borrowings and $6.2 million in long term debt. On December 17, 2010, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a three year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole book manager and Bank of America, N.A., as lender. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans in the amount of 54 $300 million (the Revolver), a swingline loan of $20 million, and letters of credit. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver at the end of fiscal year 2011. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver bear interest at our option of (i) the base rate (defined as the higher of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo (3.25% at fiscal year end 2011), (b) the federal funds rate plus 1.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) (0.3% at fiscal year end 2011) plus 1.50%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies based upon our consolidated leverage ratio (the Ratio) from 0.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00, to 1.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Ratio from 1.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 2.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). Amounts outstanding under the swingline loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the base rate applicable margin. We had $0.9 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2011 that reduce amounts available under the Revolver. In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary, Fossil Japan, Inc. (Fossil Japan), entered into a 400 million Yen revolving credit facility agreement (the Facility). The Facility bears interest at the short term prime rate (1.475% at fiscal year end 2011). At the end of fiscal year 2011, we had approximately $2.6 million of outstanding borrowings under the Facility. On February 22, 2012, approximately $3.8 million of borrowings under the Facility were renewed at the short term prime rate of 1.475%, with a maturity of date of May 22, 2012. At the end of fiscal year 2011, excluding long term capital lease obligations of $2.5 million, we had outstanding long term borrowings of $3.7 million related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Fossil Group Europe, Gmbh (FGE), in the form of a term note. This note has a variable interest term with an interest rate at the end of fiscal year 2011 of 2.0%, and interest payments are due quarterly. This note requires minimum principal payments of 100,000 Swiss Francs each year, has no stated maturity and has no penalties for early termination. On April 6, 2011, our Korean subsidiary, Fossil (Korea) Limited (Fossil Korea), entered into a new $20 million credit facility agreement (the Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., Seoul Branch. Borrowings under the Agreement are renewed on a monthly basis. The Agreement bears interest, based on a three month CD rate which is published by the Korea Securities Dealers Association (3.55% at fiscal year end 2011), plus 120 basis points for a one month period or plus 130 basis points for a three month period. As of December 31, 2011, Fossil Korea had an outstanding balance of 7 billion Won, or $6.0 million, at an interest rate of 4.75%. Approximately $6.2 million of borrowings under the Agreement were renewed at an interest rate of approximately 4.75% in each of January 2012 and February 2012. The February 2012 borrowings have a maturity date of March 21, 2012. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants related to all of our credit facilities. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, common stock repurchases, planned acquisition and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months. 55 Contractual Obligations The following table identifies our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands). Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Debt obligations (1) $ 12,464 $ 8,731 $ 213 $ 213 $ 3,307 Minimum royalty payments (2) 279,626 121,233 126,549 27,854 3,990 Capital lease obligations 10,947 701 2,472 2,158 5,616 Operating lease obligations 638,857 103,177 185,680 151,419 198,581 Purchase obligations (3) 281,500 278,432 3,018 50 0 Uncertain tax positions (4) 2,677 2,677 0 0 0 Total contractual obligations $ 1,226,071 $ 514,951 $ 317,932 $ 181,694 $ 211,494 (1) Consists of borrowings in Japan, Korea and Switzerland, excluding contractual interest payments that are variable in nature. (2) Consists primarily of exclusive licenses to manufacture watches and jewelry under trademarks not owned by us. Also includes amounts owed pursuant to various license and design service agreements under which we are obligated to pay the licensors a percentage of our net sales of these licensed products, subject to minimum scheduled royalty, design and advertising payments. (3) Consists primarily of outstanding letters of credit, which represent inventory purchase commitments that typically mature in one to eight months and open non cancelable purchase orders. (4) Management has only included its current ASC 740 liability in the table above. Long term amounts of $15.3 million have been excluded because the payment timing cannot be reasonably estimated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 56 Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data The table below sets forth selected quarterly consolidated financial information. The information is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and includes, in the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Certain line items presented in the tables below, when aggregated, may not agree with the corresponding line items on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 due to rounding (in thousands, except per share data). Fiscal Year 2011 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Net sales $ 536,975 $ 556,661 $ 642,910 $ 830,756 Gross profit 301,812 311,976 359,529 465,869 Operating expenses 209,256 225,714 240,720 291,505 Operating income 92,556 86,262 118,809 174,364 Income before income taxes 89,258 81,688 111,811 168,803 Provision for income taxes 31,192 27,657 39,307 46,001 Net income 58,066 54,031 72,504 122,802 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 2,244 2,670 2,895 4,891 Net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. 55,822 51,361 69,609 117,911 Comprehensive income 72,109 62,777 58,068 117,210 Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interest 2,244 2,670 2,895 4,891 Comprehensive income attributable to Fossil, Inc. 69,865 60,107 55,173 112,319 Earnings per share: Basic 0.87 0.81 1.10 1.88 Diluted 0.86 0.80 1.09 1.87 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 56.2 % 56.0 % 55.9 % 56.1 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 39.0 % 40.5 % 37.4 % 35.1 % Operating income as a percentage of net sales 17.2 % 15.5 % 18.5 % 21.0 % Fiscal Year 2010 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Net sales $ 393,229 $ 412,560 $ 523,825 $ 701,076 Gross profit 219,419 236,885 298,743 400,118 Operating expenses 168,156 172,539 187,473 250,582 Operating income 51,263 64,346 111,270 149,536 Income before income taxes 53,739 64,524 111,257 154,690 Provision for income taxes 16,043 7,965 40,353 54,959 Net income 37,696 56,559 70,904 99,731 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 1,789 2,074 2,748 3,074 Net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. 35,907 54,485 68,156 96,657 Comprehensive income 25,496 43,323 88,705 92,324 Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interest 1,780 2,062 2,764 3,084 Comprehensive income attributable to Fossil, Inc. 23,716 41,261 85,941 89,240 Earnings per share: Basic 0.54 0.81 1.02 1.48 Diluted 0.53 0.80 1.00 1.46 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 55.8 % 57.4 % 57.0 % 57.1 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 42.8 % 41.8 % 35.8 % 35.7 % Operating income as a percentage of net sales 13.0 % 15.6 % 21.2 % 21.3 % While the majority of our products are not seasonal in nature, a significant portion of our net sales and operating income is generally derived in the second half of the fiscal year. Our third and fourth quarters, which include the back to school and Christmas seasons, have historically generated a significant portion of our 57 annual operating income. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers. We currently believe that our inventory levels at our largest customers in the U.S. about which we have sufficient information to form an opinion were near their targeted inventory levels at the end of fiscal year 2011. As we expand our retail store base and e commerce businesses, sales from our Direct to consumer segment may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of sales in our Direct to consumer segment, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays and the mix of products sold by us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso as compared to the U.S. dollar. Due to our vertical nature whereby a significant portion of goods are sourced from our owned facilities, the foreign currency risks relate primarily to the necessary current settlement of intercompany inventory transactions. We employ a variety of operating practices to manage these market risks relative to foreign currency exchange rate changes and, where deemed appropriate, utilize foreign currency forward contracts. These operating practices include, among others, our ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars at spot rates and to maintain U.S. dollar pricing relative to sales of our products to certain distributors located outside the U.S. The use of foreign currency forward contracts allows us to offset exposure to rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. We use derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and do not use them for speculation or for trading. There were no significant changes in how we managed foreign currency transactional exposure in fiscal year 2011 and management does not anticipate any significant changes in such exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposure in the near future. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell 113.3 million Euro for approximately $156.6 million, expiring through June 2013, 2.8 billion Japanese Yen for approximately $33.3 million, expiring through December 2013, 14.9 million British Pounds for approximately $23.7 million, expiring through June 2013, 8.3 million Australian Dollars for approximately $7.7 million, expiring through September 2012, 97.7 million Mexican Pesos for approximately $7.3 million, expiring through July 2012 and 16.6 million Canadian Dollars for approximately $16.6 million, expiring through June 2013. If we were to settle our Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar based contracts at fiscal year end 2011, the net result would be a net gain of approximately $4.8 million, net of taxes. At fiscal year end 2011, a 10% unfavorable change in the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies to which we have balance sheet transactional exposures would have reduced net pre tax income by $12.8 million. The translation of the balance sheets of our foreign based operations from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At fiscal year end 2011, a 10% unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the foreign currencies to which we have exposure would have reduced consolidated stockholders equity by approximately $35.9 million. In the view of management, these hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 58 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of mens and womens fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses, soft accessories, shoes and clothing. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company owned retail and factory outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL catalogs and website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macys, Dillards, JCPenney, Kohls, Sears, Wal Mart and Target. In the United States, our network of Company owned stores included 123 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 74 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 31, 2011. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products through our catalogs and on our website, www.fossil.com, as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites. Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in over 120 countries worldwide through 22 Company owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of over 60 independent distributors. Our products are distributed in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Central and South America, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, and the Middle East. Our products are offered on airlines and cruise ships and in international Company owned retail stores, which included 171 retail stores and 30 outlet stores in select international markets as of December 31, 2011. Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries. Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers control, such as natural disasters like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that occurred during fiscal year 2011. As a result of these natural disasters, we experienced an increase in the cost of movements that negatively impacted gross profit margin in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. We do not expect material changes in movement costs during fiscal year 2012. Effective January 3, 2010, we made changes to the presentation of reportable segments to reflect changes in the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our operations, develops strategy and allocates capital resources. Prior to January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consisted of the following: United States wholesale, Europe wholesale, Other International wholesale and Direct to consumer. Effective January 3, 2010, our reportable segments consist of the following: North America wholesale, Europe wholesale, Asia Pacific wholesale and Direct to consumer. These changes included the reclassification of our wholesale operations in Canada and Mexico and our U.S. export business, all of which were previously recorded within our 41 Other International wholesale segment, to the North America wholesale segment. Our U.S. domestic wholesale operations previously recorded within the United States wholesale segment, were also reclassified to the North America wholesale segment. Our Asia Pacific wholesale operations, previously recorded within the Other International wholesale segment, were reclassified to the Asia Pacific wholesale segment. Our operations related to our joint venture with Fossil Spain, S.A., previously recorded within the Other International wholesale segment, were reclassified to the Europe wholesale segment. For comparison purposes, our historical segment disclosures were recast to be consistent with the current presentation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation reserves and stock based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments. Product Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. Bad Debt. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of their current credit information. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified. Additionally, we secure credit insurance policies in certain countries. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future credit losses may differ from those experienced in the past. Our bad debt allowance has increased over the last three fiscal years due to the challenging global economic environment. As a result of the difficult economic environment, some of our domestic and international customers have experienced financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. We increased our bad debt allowance to reserve for these bankruptcies, as well as increased risks of non payment and increased risk of customer charge backs. Our policy is to maintain the reserve balances for bankruptcies until such time as the bankruptcies are actually settled. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges, or market. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. 42 Long lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected discounted cash flows related to the asset. We apply Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, impairment losses are recorded in selling and distribution expenses. In addition, impairment losses resulting from property, plant and equipment in our corporate costs area are recorded in general and administrative expenses. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses of $1.0 million, $5.6 million and $2.5 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Impairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. Additionally, if events or conditions were to indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable, we would evaluate goodwill for impairment at that time. We have three reporting units for which we evaluate goodwill for impairment, North America wholesale, Europe wholesale and Asia Pacific wholesale. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its recorded value, no impairment charge is recorded. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting units fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill may be incurred. We evaluate trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 98% of our total trade name balances at the end of both fiscal years 2011 and 2010. We performed the required annual impairment test and recorded no impairment charges in fiscal year 2011. We recorded impairment charges of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2010 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names and $2.7 million in fiscal year 2009 related to the ZODIAC and OYZTERBAY trade names. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 62%. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods. Income Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. The estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding unusual or infrequently occurring items, to determine the year to date tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision 43 during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate excluding the impact of infrequent or unusual items. Warranty Costs. Our FOSSIL watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for a period of 11 years from the date of purchase. RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. are covered by a comparable 12 year limited warranty, while all other watch brands sold in the U.S. are covered by a comparable two year limited warranty. Generally, all of our watch products sold in Canada, Europe and Asia are covered by a comparable two year limited warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The year end warranty liability for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $11.0 million, $8.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Hedge Accounting. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We have elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging for these hedges. Our objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risks primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity, and are recognized in other (expense) income net in the period which approximates the time the hedged inventory is sold. Litigation Reserves. Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims that may arise, changes in the circumstances used to estimate amounts for prior period claims and favorable or unfavorable final settlements of prior period claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revise estimates as appropriate. As new claims arise or circumstances change relative to prior claim assessments, revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation (ASC 718). We utilize the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (i) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), (ii) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and (iii) the number of options that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011 04, Fair Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011 04). FASB intends the new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amended guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 assets and liabilities for which we will be required to disclose quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements. These changes became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In June 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive 44 income and its components in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments in the update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. This amendment also required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. However, in December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011 05 (ASU 2011 12). ASU 2011 12 defers the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income while FASB further deliberates this aspect of the proposal. ASU 2011 05, as amended by ASU 2011 12, became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In September 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011 08). ASU 2011 08 simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment by allowing companies the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes from the qualitative assessment that impairment is more likely than not, the entity is required to perform the two step quantitative impairment test. These changes became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 08 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, (i) the percentages of our net sales represented by certain line items from our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and (ii) the percentage changes in these line items between the fiscal years indicated.

The following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment and the percentage relationship of each segment to consolidated net sales for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except percentage data): Amounts Percentage of Total Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Wholesale North America $ 967.5 $ 779.2 $ 551.1 37.7 % 38.3 % 35.6 % Europe 695.4 547.4 467.1 27.1 27.0 30.2 Asia Pacific 297.0 220.8 153.8 11.5 10.9 9.9 Total wholesale 1,959.9 1,547.4 1,172.0 76.3 76.2 75.7 Direct to consumer 607.4 483.3 376.1 23.7 23.8 24.3 Consolidated $ 2,567.3 $ 2,030.7 $ 1,548.1 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010 Net Sales. The following table illustrates by factor the total year over year percentage change in net sales by segment and on a consolidated basis: Exchange Rates Organic Change Total Change North America wholesale 0.1 % 24.1 % 24.2 % Europe wholesale 5.1 21.9 27.0 Asia Pacific wholesale 6.7 27.8 34.5 Direct to consumer 2.1 23.6 25.7 Consolidated 2.6 % 23.8 % 26.4 % The following net sales discussion excludes the impact on sales growth attributable to foreign currency rate changes as noted in the above table. Consolidated Net Sales. We believe watch sales across all of our operating segments are benefiting from a resurgence in the watch category in general, resulting in consumers allocating more of their discretionary spending to this fashion category. We also believe our results are outpacing those of our competitors as consumers respond positively to our innovative product offerings and focused presentations at retail. We attribute this favorable consumer response to our designs, which incorporate newer materials into the construction of the watch while also maintaining a very strong price to value relationship. With respect to the FOSSIL brand, we have followed a strategy of focusing our marketing efforts on point of sale presentations, as well as our catalog and web based marketing initiatives and the growth of our FOSSIL store and e commerce footprint. We believe these strategies are clearly communicating the aspirational lifestyle image of the brand and are resonating strongly with consumers around the world. Net sales of FOSSIL branded products increased by 17.3% during fiscal year 2011. North America Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in the North America wholesale segment rose 24.1%, or $187.4 million, during fiscal year 2011, including double digit sales growth across all major product categories. Watch sales increased 29.5%, or $162.7 million, representing broad based growth across brands. Licensed brand watch sales were led by sales volume increases in MICHAEL KORS of $83.1 million, DIESEL of $14.3 million, ARMANI EXCHANGE of $11.8 million, MARC BY MARC JACOBS of $10.8 million, BURBERRY of $8.5 million and EMPORIO ARMANI of $8.2 million. Additionally, FOSSIL and RELIC watch sales volumes increased $16.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by sales volume 46 declines of $4.5 million in our mass market business. Shipments to third party distributors, located primarily in South America, increased by 47.9%, or $36.9 million, during fiscal year 2011. MICHAEL KORS sales volume increases were primarily attributable to increased case space allocated by retailers in the department store channel as a result of strong sell through rates and door expansion in MICHAEL KORS boutiques. DIESEL, ARMANI EXCHANGE and EMPORIO ARMANI sales volume increases were principally driven by increased doors with existing customers in the department store channel. DIESEL sales volumes also benefitted from a shift in the sales mix to higher price points. Increases in MARC BY MARC JACOBS and BURBERRY were primarily a result of increased sell through rates with existing customers in the department store channel. We believe the RELIC sales volumes were favorably impacted by an upward trend in the overall fashion watch category in the mid tier department store channel. Decreased sales volumes in our mass market distribution channel were principally driven by retailers destocking inventory levels. The leather and jewelry categories also contributed to the sales volume growth in North America during fiscal year 2011, increasing 11.5%, or $19.7 million, and 24.0%, or $5.4 million, respectively. Growth in the leathers business was primarily attributable to FOSSIL womens and mens leather sales volume increases of $14.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The FOSSIL leathers business was favorably impacted by increased sell through rates at retail and increased average unit retail prices as a result of introducing a growing selection of higher quality details and fabrications in our leather products. Increases in the jewelry category were primarily the result of the launch of MICHAEL KORS jewelry during fiscal year 2011, which contributed $6.4 million, partially offset by a sales volume decline of $2.4 million in FOSSIL accessory jewelry as a result of lower sell through rates in fiscal year 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. Europe wholesale net sales rose 21.9%, or $119.9 million, during fiscal year 2011, primarily as a result of a 22.7%, or $90.0 million, increase in watch shipments. All key markets and major watch brands experienced growth, with the greatest gains delivered by MICHAEL KORS of $23.5 million, FOSSIL of $21.5 million, DKNY of $11.2 million, DIESEL of $10.0 million and EMPORIO ARMANI and BURBERRY of $8.9 million each. Sales growth in MICHAEL KORS primarily resulted from increased door growth in the region as well as the continuing brand building initiatives by the licensor. We believe the growth in all of our other watch brands was a result of consumers positive response to our focused and innovative designs, lifestyle brand imaging and the strong price to value relationship of our product offerings in comparison to our competitors in the region. The leather and jewelry businesses also favorably impacted fiscal year 2011 by increasing 71.8%, or $19.0 million, and 11.0%, or $11.2 million, respectively. The leather business continues to expand in Europe as a result of the increased FOSSIL brand awareness generated from the growing number of retail stores and websites launched in key markets. Additionally, during fiscal year 2011, sales to third party distributors, located primarily in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, rose 40.3%, or $35.1 million, as a result of increased brand awareness and higher sell through rates. Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. In fiscal year 2011, Asia Pacific wholesale net sales increased 27.8%, or $61.4 million. This increase was principally attributable to increases in our watch and leather categories of 32.1%, or $61.0 million, and 36.2%, or $4.6 million, respectively. These sales volume gains were partially offset by a 42.9%, or $5.2 million, decrease in jewelry sales volumes primarily as a result of discontinuing a non strategic, local jewelry brand in India. Our business model in Asia is focused on expanding our concessions model across key markets while exploring opportunities to further advance the FOSSIL brand across the region. Combined sales volumes in our strategic markets of China, Korea and Japan increased 39.7% during fiscal year 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. At the end of fiscal year 2011, we operated 213 concession locations in Asia with a net 52 new concessions opened during the last twelve months. For the 2011 fiscal year, concession sales increased by 74.1% with comparable store sales growing 24.1% in comparison to the prior fiscal year. These concessions represent a large opportunity for us in that they allow us to control the brand presentation and customer experience at the point of sale and capture the full retail price. We believe our diverse global distribution network, including owned distribution in 22 countries, combined with our design and marketing capabilities, will allow us to continue to take shelf space from lesser known local 47 and regional brands as we continue to increase brand awareness through the growth of our retail stores and introduction of new websites in many of the countries in which we operate. We also believe that investments we have made in certain emerging markets will allow us to experience higher levels of growth in our international wholesale segments in comparison to our North America wholesale segment. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to consumer net sales increased 23.6%, or $113.8 million, during fiscal year 2011, principally the result of comparable store sales increases of 17.4% and a 6.1% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year. The emphasis we have placed upon engaging our customers within our redesigned store environment and the focus on our proven selling metrics has improved store productivity. During fiscal year 2011, comparable store sales related to our global full price accessory concept increased by 11.5%, while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 26.2%. Additionally, our Direct to consumer segment was favorably impacted in fiscal year 2011 by $5.0 million of additional e commerce sales, primarily driven by our U.S., Germany and U.K. based e commerce businesses. In December, our most productive month for e commerce, our e commerce business increased by 11.7% in 2011 as compared to December 2010. We ended fiscal year 2011 with 398 stores, including 245 full price accessory stores, 142 of which were outside of North America, 104 outlet locations, including 29 outside of North America, 36 clothing stores, including 4 outside of North America, and 13 full price multi brand stores, including 11 outside of North America. This compares to 364 stores at the end of fiscal year 2010, including 230 full price accessory stores, 127 of which were outside of North America, 93 outlet locations, including 22 outside of North America, 31 clothing stores, including 3 outside of North America, and 10 full price multi brand stores, including 9 outside of North America. During fiscal year 2011, we opened 51 new stores and closed 17 stores. During fiscal year 2012, we anticipate opening approximately 70 to 75 additional retail stores and closing approximately 18 stores globally. A store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and or relocation. During 2006, we entered into an agreement with the House of Fraser, a U.K. based department store (HOF), which allows us to operate the watch department in certain HOF stores. Under this agreement, we own the inventory within the HOF store, provide the labor to operate the department and pay HOF a commission on the retail watch sales generated in the stores. Although we include the net sales derived from the HOF stores in our Direct to consumer segment, we do not include the number of locations associated with this agreement in our retail store count or in our comparable store sales. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2011 represented an increase of 24.6% in comparison to $1.2 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net sales partially offset by a reduction in gross profit margin. Gross profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 56.1% in fiscal year 2011 compared to 56.9% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by increased production costs, lower margin sales to off price retailers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the sales mix of lower margin sales to third party distributors. Partially offsetting these declines in gross profit margin was an increase in the mix of sales of higher margin watch products in comparison to leather products, including a greater mix of higher margin licensed watch brands in fiscal year 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Additionally, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar during fiscal year 2011 in comparison to the prior fiscal year benefitted gross profit margin by approximately 180 basis points. Our consolidated gross profit margin is also impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses, and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch, jewelry and sunglass 48 offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods categories. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. From a segment standpoint, our Direct to consumer business generally produces the highest gross profit margin as a result of these sales being direct to the ultimate consumer. Gross profit margins related to sales in our international wholesale segments are historically lower than our Direct to consumer segment, but historically higher than our North America wholesale segment primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S., (ii) the product sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our international wholesale segments, in comparison to our North America wholesale segment, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 37.7% in fiscal year 2011 compared to 38.3% in the prior fiscal year. Total operating expenses in fiscal year 2011 increased by $188.4 million, primarily as a result of increased sales. The translation of foreign based expenses in fiscal year 2011 increased operating expenses by $23.3 million as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar, in comparison to the prior fiscal year. Excluding currency effects, fiscal year 2011 operating expenses in our wholesale segments, Direct to consumer segment and corporate cost areas increased by $76.9 million, $57.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively, as compared to the prior fiscal year. A majority of the expense growth in the wholesale segments was related to ongoing investments in the Asia region. Expense growth in other regions was primarily related to increased compensation costs and marketing expenses. Expense increases in the Direct to consumer segment were primarily attributable to store growth, increased web based marketing expenditures, expansion of our catalog costs and costs associated with the launch and ongoing expenses of our customer relationship management initiative. Expense growth in the corporate cost area was primarily attributable to increased payroll costs due to headcount additions and incentive and equity based compensation, and operating costs and incurring expenses to move into our new corporate headquarters. In addition, fiscal year 2010 included a non cash charge of approximately $3.7 million related to an other than temporary fixed asset impairment. The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America wholesale $ 165.4 17.1 % $ 146.3 18.8 % Europe wholesale 199.2 28.6 164.1 30.0 Asia Pacific wholesale 134.1 45.2 96.1 43.5 Direct to consumer 322.7 53.1 258.2 53.4 Corporate 145.8 114.1 Total $ 967.2 37.7 % $ 778.8 38.3 % Operating Income. Operating income increased $95.6 million, or 25.4%, in fiscal year 2011. As a percentage of net sales, operating income decreased slightly to 18.4% of net sales in fiscal year 2011 compared to 18.5% of net sales in the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a decrease in gross profit margin, partially offset by 60 basis points of operating expense leverage. During fiscal year 2011, operating income was positively impacted by approximately $39.2 million as a result of the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $1.3 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily driven by increased participation by our Asia Pacific subsidiaries in our intercompany cash pool at interest rates in excess of those earned on cash deposits by our European subsidiaries participating in the pool. 49 Other (Expense) Income Net. Other (expense) income net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from mark to market, hedging and other transactional activities, and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2011, other (expense) income net changed unfavorably by approximately $27.0 million, primarily driven by net foreign currency transaction losses of $20.7 million in fiscal year 2011, as compared to net foreign currency transaction gains of $5.2 million in fiscal year 2010. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 was $144.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.9%, compared to 31.1% in fiscal year 2010. Fiscal year 2011 income tax expense was positively impacted due to certain tax provision offsets carrying a higher effective tax rate. Fiscal year 2010 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits during the fiscal year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which represents the minority interest portion of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100%, increased $3.0 million for fiscal year 2011. This increase was primarily a result of increased net income related to our less than 100% owned watch assembly facilities. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2011 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 15.5% to $294.7 million, or $4.61 per diluted share, in comparison to $255.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. for fiscal year 2011 included net foreign currency gains of $0.14 per diluted share and a $0.26 per diluted share benefit as a result of a 5.5% lower outstanding share count related to our ongoing stock repurchase program. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Net Sales. The following table illustrates by factor the total year over year percentage change in net sales by segment and on a consolidated basis: Exchange Rates Organic Change Total Change North America wholesale 0.7 % 40.7 % 41.4 % Europe wholesale (5.6 ) 22.8 17.2 Asia Pacific wholesale 8.6 35.0 43.6 Direct to consumer (0.5 ) 29.0 28.5 Consolidated (0.7 )% 31.9 % 31.2 % The following net sales discussion excludes the impact on sales growth attributable to foreign currency rate changes as noted in the above table. North America Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in the North America wholesale segment, which consists of our operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and sales to third party distributors in South America, increased 40.7%, or $224.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. We attribute this increase to consumers positive reactions to our innovative product offerings and an upward trend in the fashion watch category. These favorable watch sales trends have prompted retailers to place greater emphasis on the category by increasing staff to service the watch customer, increasing open to buy dollars and expanding marketing initiatives, thereby further accelerating net sales. The increased sell through rates of our watch products at our retailers have also resulted in these customers restocking inventories during fiscal year 2010, after heavily destocking inventory levels in fiscal year 2009 due to the economic downturn. Additionally, our customers have been increasing the level of inventories in certain situations, including allocating additional retail space within their stores, to meet the increased demand for our watch products. As a result of the acceleration in sales in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to the destocking activity in fiscal year 2009, North American wholesale watch shipments increased by 60.9%, or $207.9 million, in fiscal year 2010. Licensed brands, FOSSIL and MICHELE represented the strongest net sales contributions, 50 increasing by 113.9%, 35.4% and 49.7%, respectively. Licensed brand watch sales were primarily led by sales volume increases in MICHAEL KORS of 218.4%, or $95.5 million, and, to a lesser extent, increases in EMPORIO ARMANI of 48.8%, DIESEL of 61.0%, DKNY of 46.8% and MARC BY MARC JACOBS of 61.0%. In addition, our RELIC watch business increased 20.8% during fiscal year 2010. MICHAEL KORS sales volumes were principally driven by innovative designs, increased sell through rates at retail and additional case space allocated by retailers in the department store channel. Our accessories business, which includes our mens and womens leather, jewelry, and other non watch categories, also contributed to the growth in North America as net sales volumes increased 7.9%, or $16.5 million, in fiscal year 2010. This increase was primarily a result of sales volume growth in FOSSIL accessory jewelry, shoes, womens small leathers, and sunglasses which had sales increases of 67.6%, 122.2%, 27.2% and 3.6%, respectively. Both our accessory jewelry and shoes categories were launched into the department store channel in the last two years and are still experiencing both door growth and, in some cases, assortment expansion. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of 2.6% and 3.8% in womens bags and mens leather products, respectively. Europe Wholesale Net Sales. Net sales in our Europe wholesale segment increased 22.8%, or $106.4 million, during fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2010, our Europe wholesale segment benefited from a similar level of increased consumer response to new designs as we experienced in the North America wholesale segment. Additionally, Europe wholesale net sales increases in fiscal year 2010 benefited from similar de stocking activities to that experienced in our North America wholesale segment, primarily during the last nine months of fiscal year 2009. Watch sales experienced the most significant growth, increasing 23.3%, or $78.5 million. All major watch brands contributed to this growth with increases of 19.7% in FOSSIL, 24.3% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 101.3% in MICHAEL KORS, 26.6% in DIESEL and 18.2% in DKNY representing the strongest performances. During fiscal year 2010, our jewelry and leather categories also delivered strong double digit increases of 21.0% and 46.7%, respectively. We believe net sales increases in our jewelry category were positively impacted by trends similar to those that we experienced in our watch business. We believe the growth experienced in our leather products business in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to expand our leather offerings in our wholesale channel by leveraging the increased brand awareness generated by the expansion of our FOSSIL accessory store concept in the region over the last two years. In addition, shipments to third party distributors increased 45.4% in fiscal year 2010, which we believe was principally related to increased sell through rates of our fashion watch offerings and to our distributors replenishing inventory during fiscal year 2010 in comparison to destocking inventory in the prior fiscal year. Asia Pacific Wholesale Net Sales. In fiscal year 2010, Asia Pacific wholesale shipments increased 35.0%, or $53.8 million, primarily a result of a 39.6% increase in licensed brand watch sales and, to a lesser extent, increases of 19.4% in FOSSIL watches and 55.2% in leather products. Licensed brand watch sales were led by increases of 43.0% in EMPORIO ARMANI, 127.8% in MARC BY MARC JACOBS and 54.0% in BURBERRY. In addition to consumers responding favorably to new designs, we believe the growth in our watch business was due to the growth in our retail concession base across many of our markets within this segment, including the transition of our South Korean operations from a third party distributor to a Company owned subsidiary during the 2010 fiscal year. The net sales growth in the South Korea market represented 46.6% of the $53.8 million in net sales that we added within this segment in fiscal year 2010 in comparison to fiscal year 2009. The growth in the leather category in fiscal year 2010 was a result of our initiative to broaden distribution of the category by leveraging the FOSSIL brand awareness created from an expanded FOSSIL accessory store base in this region. Direct to Consumer Net Sales. Direct to consumer net sales increased 29.0%, or $108.9 million, during fiscal year 2010, principally the result of comparable store sales increases of 19.0% and a 5.9% increase in the average number of stores open during the fiscal year. Additionally, our Direct to consumer segment was favorably impacted in fiscal year 2010 by growth of 50.2% in e commerce sales primarily driven by our U.S. and Germany based e commerce businesses. During fiscal year 2010, comparable store sales related to our global full 51 price accessory concept increased by 15.9%, while our global outlet stores experienced comparable store sales growth of 21.1%. We believe the growth in our Direct to consumer business was attributable to consumers positive response to the focused point of view and imagery of the FOSSIL brand, the continuous introduction of new and innovative designs and materials, increased catalog mailings and expanded e commerce marketing activities. We ended fiscal year 2010 with 364 stores, including 230 full price accessory stores, 127 of which were outside of North America, 93 outlet locations, including 22 outside of North America, 31 clothing stores, including 3 outside of North America, and 10 full price multi brand stores, including 9 outside of North America. This compares to 354 stores at the end of fiscal year 2009, including 218 full price accessory stores, 116 of which were outside of North America, 90 outlet locations, including 15 outside of North America, 33 clothing stores, all in North America, and 13 full price multi brand stores, including 11 outside of North America. During fiscal year 2010, we opened 33 new stores and closed 23 stores. Gross Profit. Gross profit of $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010 represented an increase of 36.7% in comparison to $844.9 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in net sales and gross profit margin expansion. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points to 56.9% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 54.6% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit margin was principally driven by an increase in the mix of sales of higher margin watch products in comparison to leather products, including a greater mix of higher margin licensed watch brands, and higher gross margins experienced in outlet stores. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a combination of decreased component costs associated with some of the new materials we incorporated into our watch designs and higher retail prices. These increases in gross profit margin were partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points during fiscal year 2010, and increased input costs related to payroll as a result of wage increases across our China assembly operations and third party component manufacturers. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased $145.5 million to $778.8 million in fiscal year 2010. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to 38.3% in fiscal year 2010 compared to 40.9% in the prior fiscal year and included a favorable impact of approximately $3.5 million related to the translation of foreign based expenses due to a stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses in our wholesale segments, Direct to consumer segment and corporate cost areas increased by $78.9 million, $35.7 million and $34.4 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2010. Expense growth in the wholesale segments was principally a result of increased marketing expenses and compensation costs. Expense increases in the Direct to consumer segment were primarily attributable to store growth, expansion of our catalog mailings and increased web based marketing expenditures. Expense growth in the corporate cost area was primarily associated with increased compensation costs, including a $3.8 million increase in equity compensation expense, and a non cash charge of approximately $3.7 million related to an other than temporary fixed asset impairment. The following table sets forth operating expenses on a segment basis and the relative percentage of operating expenses to net sales for each segment for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data): Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Operating Expense % of Net Sales Operating Expense % of Net Sales North America wholesale $ 146.3 18.8 % $ 118.9 21.6 % Europe wholesale 164.1 30.0 146.0 31.3 Asia Pacific wholesale 96.1 43.5 66.9 43.5 Direct to consumer 258.2 53.4 222.6 59.2 Corporate 114.1 78.8 Total $ 778.8 38.3 % $ 633.2 40.9 % 52 Operating Income. Operating income increased by 77.9% to $376.4 million in fiscal year 2010 compared to $211.6 million in fiscal year 2009. Operating income margin increased by 480 basis points to 18.5% of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to 13.7% in the prior fiscal year, principally as a result of increased net sales, gross profit margin expansion and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating income included approximately $6.8 million of net currency losses in fiscal year 2010 related to the translation of foreign based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $884,000 in fiscal year 2010, primarily driven by increased participation by our Asia Pacific subsidiaries in our intercompany cash pool at interest rates in excess of those earned on cash deposits by our European subsidiaries in the pool. Other (Expense) Income Net. Other (expense) income net primarily reflects interest income from investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from mark to market, hedging and other transactional activities, and equity in the earnings or losses of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain. During fiscal year 2010, other (expense) income net changed favorably by approximately $409,000 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily driven by increased equity earnings of our non consolidated joint venture in Spain and increased interest income, partially offset by decreased net foreign currency transaction gains. Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal 2010 was $119.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.1%, compared to 34.4% in fiscal year 2009. Fiscal year 2010 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits in connection with the completion of prior year income tax audits during the fiscal year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which represents the minority interest portion of subsidiaries in which we own less than 100%, increased $4.6 million for fiscal year 2010. This increase is a result of increased net income related to our less than 100% wholly owned subsidiaries with a substantial portion of this increase attributable to the net income related to one of our watch assembly facilities. Net Income Attributable to Fossil, Inc. Fiscal year 2010 net income attributable to Fossil, Inc. increased 83.4% to $255.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, in comparison to $139.2 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year 2010 earnings per diluted share of $3.77 included an approximate $0.07 diluted earnings per share reduction related to foreign currency rate changes. Effects of Inflation Although inflation in raw materials and production costs have had a negative impact on our gross profit margins, we do not believe that inflation overall has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Substantial increases in costs in the future, however, could have a material impact on us and the industry. We believe that, to the extent inflation increases our costs in the future, we could generally offset that inflation over time by increasing prices, if competitive conditions permit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the second quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by the number of new stores we open, other capital expenditures, and the amount of any discretionary stock repurchases we make. 53 Net cash provided by operating activities of $251.3 million in fiscal year 2011 was more than offset by cash used in investing and financing activities of $110.1 million and $249.9 million respectively, resulting in a $105.3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents since the end of fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2011, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $307.4 million and favorable non cash activities of $91.4 million, partially offset by an unfavorable increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $147.5 million. During fiscal year 2011, cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by $109.9 million in capital expenditures. During fiscal year 2011, cash used in financing activities was principally comprised of $270.9 million of common stock repurchases. Foreign exchange rate translations increased cash and cash equivalents by $3.4 million during fiscal year 2011. As illustrated in the contractual obligations table below, we have approximately $ 2.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recorded as liabilities and could be settled in the next 12 months. Settlement of such amounts could require utilization of working capital. As of December 31, 2011, we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on approximately $371.8 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. If in the future we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur incremental U.S. federal and state income tax, reduced by allowable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to keep these funds indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and our current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Accounts receivable increased by 14.9% to $302.5 million during fiscal year 2011 compared to $263.2 million at the end of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in wholesale shipments. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale segments for fiscal year 2011 was 46 days in comparison to 48 days in the prior fiscal year. Inventory at the end of fiscal year 2011 was $489.0 million, representing an increase of 31.5% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $371.9 million. An approximate five day reduction in lead times in watch shipments in December 2011 resulted in approximately $30 million of inventory receipts shifting from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. Additionally, given the natural disasters that occurred in Japan in early fiscal year 2011 and the concentration of our movement supply in that country, we have increased the level of inventory related to key watch component parts including those with longer lead times. In fiscal year 2010, our Board of Directors approved two common stock repurchase programs pursuant to which up to $30 million and $750 million, respectively, could be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. Both of these repurchase programs are to be conducted pursuant to Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The $750 million repurchase program has a termination date of December 2013 and the $30 million repurchase program has no termination date. We repurchased 3.1 million shares under the $750 million repurchase program during fiscal year 2010 at a cost of $179.2 million. During fiscal year 2011, we repurchased 3.1 million shares under the $750 million repurchase program at a cost of $270.9 million. We did not make any repurchases under the $30 million plan during fiscal year 2011. On February 16, 2012, we entered into a new $100 million 10b5 1 plan under the $750 million repurchase program. This new plan has a termination date of May 3, 2012. At the end of fiscal year 2011, we had working capital of $844.1 million compared to working capital of $801.3 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, we had approximately $9.0 million of outstanding short term borrowings and $6.2 million in long term debt. On December 17, 2010, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a three year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole book manager and Bank of America, N.A., as lender. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans in the amount of 54 $300 million (the Revolver), a swingline loan of $20 million, and letters of credit. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver at the end of fiscal year 2011. Amounts outstanding under the Revolver bear interest at our option of (i) the base rate (defined as the higher of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo (3.25% at fiscal year end 2011), (b) the federal funds rate plus 1.50% and (c) the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) (0.3% at fiscal year end 2011) plus 1.50%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies based upon our consolidated leverage ratio (the Ratio) from 0.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00, to 1.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Ratio from 1.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 2.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). Amounts outstanding under the swingline loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the base rate applicable margin. We had $0.9 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2011 that reduce amounts available under the Revolver. In November 2009, our Japanese subsidiary, Fossil Japan, Inc. (Fossil Japan), entered into a 400 million Yen revolving credit facility agreement (the Facility). The Facility bears interest at the short term prime rate (1.475% at fiscal year end 2011). At the end of fiscal year 2011, we had approximately $2.6 million of outstanding borrowings under the Facility. On February 22, 2012, approximately $3.8 million of borrowings under the Facility were renewed at the short term prime rate of 1.475%, with a maturity of date of May 22, 2012. At the end of fiscal year 2011, excluding long term capital lease obligations of $2.5 million, we had outstanding long term borrowings of $3.7 million related to our wholly owned subsidiary, Fossil Group Europe, Gmbh (FGE), in the form of a term note. This note has a variable interest term with an interest rate at the end of fiscal year 2011 of 2.0%, and interest payments are due quarterly. This note requires minimum principal payments of 100,000 Swiss Francs each year, has no stated maturity and has no penalties for early termination. On April 6, 2011, our Korean subsidiary, Fossil (Korea) Limited (Fossil Korea), entered into a new $20 million credit facility agreement (the Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., Seoul Branch. Borrowings under the Agreement are renewed on a monthly basis. The Agreement bears interest, based on a three month CD rate which is published by the Korea Securities Dealers Association (3.55% at fiscal year end 2011), plus 120 basis points for a one month period or plus 130 basis points for a three month period. As of December 31, 2011, Fossil Korea had an outstanding balance of 7 billion Won, or $6.0 million, at an interest rate of 4.75%. Approximately $6.2 million of borrowings under the Agreement were renewed at an interest rate of approximately 4.75% in each of January 2012 and February 2012. The February 2012 borrowings have a maturity date of March 21, 2012. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants related to all of our credit facilities. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs, common stock repurchases, planned acquisition and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months. 55 Contractual Obligations The following table identifies our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands). Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Debt obligations (1) $ 12,464 $ 8,731 $ 213 $ 213 $ 3,307 Minimum royalty payments (2) 279,626 121,233 126,549 27,854 3,990 Capital lease obligations 10,947 701 2,472 2,158 5,616 Operating lease obligations 638,857 103,177 185,680 151,419 198,581 Purchase obligations (3) 281,500 278,432 3,018 50 0 Uncertain tax positions (4) 2,677 2,677 0 0 0 Total contractual obligations $ 1,226,071 $ 514,951 $ 317,932 $ 181,694 $ 211,494 (1) Consists of borrowings in Japan, Korea and Switzerland, excluding contractual interest payments that are variable in nature. (2) Consists primarily of exclusive licenses to manufacture watches and jewelry under trademarks not owned by us. Also includes amounts owed pursuant to various license and design service agreements under which we are obligated to pay the licensors a percentage of our net sales of these licensed products, subject to minimum scheduled royalty, design and advertising payments. (3) Consists primarily of outstanding letters of credit, which represent inventory purchase commitments that typically mature in one to eight months and open non cancelable purchase orders. (4) Management has only included its current ASC 740 liability in the table above. Long term amounts of $15.3 million have been excluded because the payment timing cannot be reasonably estimated. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None. 56 Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data The table below sets forth selected quarterly consolidated financial information. The information is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and includes, in the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair statement of results for such periods. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Certain line items presented in the tables below, when aggregated, may not agree with the corresponding line items on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 due to rounding (in thousands, except per share data).

Our third and fourth quarters, which include the back to school and Christmas seasons, have historically generated a significant portion of our 57 annual operating income. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers. We currently believe that our inventory levels at our largest customers in the U.S. about which we have sufficient information to form an opinion were near their targeted inventory levels at the end of fiscal year 2011. As we expand our retail store base and e commerce businesses, sales from our Direct to consumer segment may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of sales in our Direct to consumer segment, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays and the mix of products sold by us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso as compared to the U.S. dollar. Due to our vertical nature whereby a significant portion of goods are sourced from our owned facilities, the foreign currency risks relate primarily to the necessary current settlement of intercompany inventory transactions. We employ a variety of operating practices to manage these market risks relative to foreign currency exchange rate changes and, where deemed appropriate, utilize foreign currency forward contracts. These operating practices include, among others, our ability to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars at spot rates and to maintain U.S. dollar pricing relative to sales of our products to certain distributors located outside the U.S. The use of foreign currency forward contracts allows us to offset exposure to rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. We use derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and do not use them for speculation or for trading. There were no significant changes in how we managed foreign currency transactional exposure in fiscal year 2011 and management does not anticipate any significant changes in such exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposure in the near future. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell 113.3 million Euro for approximately $156.6 million, expiring through June 2013, 2.8 billion Japanese Yen for approximately $33.3 million, expiring through December 2013, 14.9 million British Pounds for approximately $23.7 million, expiring through June 2013, 8.3 million Australian Dollars for approximately $7.7 million, expiring through September 2012, 97.7 million Mexican Pesos for approximately $7.3 million, expiring through July 2012 and 16.6 million Canadian Dollars for approximately $16.6 million, expiring through June 2013. If we were to settle our Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar based contracts at fiscal year end 2011, the net result would be a net gain of approximately $4.8 million, net of taxes. At fiscal year end 2011, a 10% unfavorable change in the U.S. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies to which we have balance sheet transactional exposures would have reduced net pre tax income by $12.8 million. The translation of the balance sheets of our foreign based operations from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
