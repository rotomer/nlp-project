The cancellation of substantially all of First Solar US Manufacturing, LLCs minority membership units in January 2003 did not affect the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Successor. As a result, we believe that the Predecessor and Successor financial statements are comparable. Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions as described under the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview We design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world. Each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. We manufacture our solar modules on a high throughput production line and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated, continuous process. In 2006, we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany. 30 Table of Contents Currently, we manufacture our solar modules and conduct our research and development activities at our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility. We completed the qualification of our base plant in Perrysburg for high volume production in November 2004. During 2005, the first full year our base plant operated at high volume production, we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to $1.59, from $2.94 in 2004. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to $1.40 in 2006. We define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period, including stock based compensation expense relating to our adoption of SFAS 123(R), divided by the total watts produced during the period. By continuing to expand globally production and improve our technology and manufacturing process, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt. Our objective is to become, by 2010, the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that competes on a non subsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets in the United States, Europe and Asia. To approach the price of retail electricity in such markets, we believe that we will need to reduce our manufacturing costs per watt by an additional 40 50%, assuming prices for traditional energy sources remain flat on an inflation adjusted basis. First Solar was founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research, development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in January 2002. From January 2002 to the end of 2005, we sold approximately 28MW of solar modules. During 2006, we sold approximately 56MW of solar modules. We converted, on February 22, 2006, from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. Prior that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2006, all references to fiscal year 2005 relate to the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2005 and all references to fiscal year 2004 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 25, 2004. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity We commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in Perrysburg, Ohio in January 2002. During 2003 and 2004, while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line, we designed the base plant, a replicable, high throughput production line. We ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into the base plant, completing the qualification of the base plant for full volume production in November 2004. The base plant has an expected annual capacity of 25MW. In February 2005, we commenced construction of two additional 25MW production lines at our Perrysburg, Ohio facility, which we refer to as our Ohio expansion. We completed the qualification of the Ohio expansion for full volume production in August 2006. During the construction of the Ohio expansion, we improved certain aspects of the base plant, including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment. Our two line Ohio expansion represents a standard building block for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities. In February 2006, we commenced construction of our German plant, a new manufacturing facility located in Frankfurt (Oder), in the State of Brandenburg, Germany that will house four 25MW production lines for a total of 100 MW name plate capacity. We anticipate completing the qualification of the German plant for full volume production during the second half of 2007. On January 24, 2007, we entered into a lease for a site in the Kulim Hi Tech Park in Kadah State, Malaysia where we plan to start construction of a four line 100MW plant in the second quarter of 2007. 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our current and in process production capacity: Annual Production Capacity of Date Qualification Number of Manufacturing Facility(1) Completed for Production Number of Solar Full Volume Manufacturing Facility Lines Modules Watts Production Base plant 1 400,000 25MW November 2004 Ohio expansion 2 800,000 50MW August 2006 German plant 4 1,600,000 100MW Second half of 2007 (2) Malaysia plant 4 1,600,000 100MW Second half of 2008 (2) Total Current and Planned 11 4,400,000 275MW (1) The annual capacity of our manufacturing facilities is based on an annual run rate of 400,000 solar modules per production line and a power rating of approximately 62 watts per solar module. (2) Anticipated. Each production line currently has an annual production capacity of 400,000 solar modules, representing 25MW. We anticipate that we will be able to increase both the run rate and MW volume of our existing production lines through our continuous improvement program. For example, we increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from approximately 7% in 2003 to approximately 9% at the end of 2006, thereby increasing the number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 49 watts to approximately 64 Watts. Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. Net Sales We generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules. Over the past three years, the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce. We price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. For example, our average sales price was $2.39 per watt during the 2006. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts. We currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany, which then resell our solar modules to end users who receive government subsidies. Our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in Europe, the United States, or Asia or if interest rates increase, which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects. In April 2006, we entered into contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European project developers and system integrators. We refer to these as our Long Term Sales Contracts. These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2006 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance. The initial terms of the Long Term Sales Contracts allowed us to deliver 795MW of solar modules from 2006 through 2011, which would generate 1.2 billion ($1.6 billion at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) of sales over that period based on the contractual pricing. In December 2006, we exercised our option under each of the Long Term Sales Contracts to increase the sales volumes that we can deliver, starting in 2008 and to extend each contract through 2012. We also amended the Long Term Sales Contracts with four of our customers in January 2007 to further increase the sales volumes that we can deliver over the duration of each contract. As a result of the option exercises and amendments as of January 9, 2007 our long term supply contracts allowed for approximately 2.3 billion ($3.0 billion at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) in sales from 2006 to 2012 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 1,554MW of solar modules, of which 50MW was sold in 2006. Our Long Term Supply Contracts require us to deliver solar modules each year that, in total, meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year. We are required to increase the minimum 32 Table of Contents average number of watts per module by approximately 5% annually between 2007 and 2009, and then by an additional 3% for modules delivered in 2012. If we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year, we will be in breach of the agreements, entitling our customers to certain remedies, potentially including the right to terminate their Long Term Supply Contracts. In addition, our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 6.5% each year through the expiration date of the contract in 2012. Because these sales prices under our Long Term Sales Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to our customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Sales Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin. The annual 6.5% decline in the sales price under the Long Term Sales Contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 5 6% each year, assuming that rated power of our solar modules remains flat and will impact our cash flow accordingly. As a result, our gross profit and gross margin could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual prices decrease. Furthermore, the sales prices under the Long Term Sales Contracts are denominated in Euros, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Under the Long Term Sales Contracts, starting in April 2006, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Under our customer contracts in effect prior to April 1, 2006, we did not transfer title or risk of loss, or recognize revenue, until the solar modules were received by our customers. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. We retain the right to terminate the Long Term Sales Contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that any of the following material adverse changes have occurred: new laws, rules or regulations with respect to our production, distribution, installation, or reclamation and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business; unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread, persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels; or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor, materials, or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput. The average termination fee under those agreements was 2.8 million ($3.6 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) under the initial contracts and is now 3.8 million ($4.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) following our exercise of the option to increase our volume commitments. Our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts to be negotiated with each of the customers and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the case of a late delivery, our customers are entitled to a maximum charge of up to 6% of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments or the minimum average watt per module, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. We estimate that the total sales volume under our Long Term Sales Contracts will account for approximately two thirds of our planned production volumes from our base plant in Ohio, Ohio expansion plant and German plant and also some of our planned production from our Malaysian plant. We spent $70.1 million in capital expenditures for the Ohio expansion. We are committing $150.0 million for the build out of our German plant through 2007 and anticipate that the build out of our Malaysian plant will require approximately $150.0 million through 2008. The information about our Long Term Supply Contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the Long Term Supply Contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results, including revenues or profitability. No single customer accounted for more than 20% of our net sales in 2006. Cost of sales Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials, such as tempered back glass, TCO coated front glass, cadmium telluride, EVA laminate, connector assemblies and laminate edge seal. Our total material cost per solar 33 Table of Contents module has been stable over the past three years, even though the cost of tellurium, a component of cadmium telluride, increased by approximately three times from 2003 to 2006. The increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs. Historically, we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials. In 2006, however, we entered into a multi year tellurium supply contract in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase. Other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and end of life reclamation and recycling expenses to our cost of sales. We implemented a program in 2005 to reclaim and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our reclamation and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their use and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be recycled and the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our program or another program that we approve. The photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation. We record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per line, geographic diversification and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Gross profits are affected by a number of factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our actual manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. For example, our long term customer contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines 6.5% each year. Another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production due to a lesser absorption of fixed cost until full production volumes are reached. As a result, gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. In 2006, we began adding equipment for further process developments and recording the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense. We may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the Ohio expansion to research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and manufacturing processes. As of December 30, 2006, we had a total of 34 employees working on these research and development activities. In addition, we maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. During the past three years, we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs. We received $1.0 million in research and development grants during 2004 and $0.9 million each during 2005 and 2006. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. 34 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts sold increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. We incurred production start up expenses of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2005 and $11.7 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the qualification of the Ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the German plant. We also expect to incur significant production start up expenses in fiscal year 2007 in connection with the German plant and the Malaysian plant. In general, we expect production start up expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entire new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of a new production line at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required. Over time, we expect production start up expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Interest expense Interest expense is associated with various debt financings. See Debt and Credit Sources. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. Other income (expense) Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Income Taxes First Solar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on February 22, 2006. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to federal and state income taxes. Prior to February 22, 2006, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes. As a result, the annual historical financial data included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been, had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year. On December 30, 2006, we had non U.S. net operating loss carry forwards of $6.4 million, which have an unlimited expiration period, compared to $3.4 million on December 31, 2005. Our ability to use these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws. Certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions. We expect the tax consequences of our non U.S. subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our non U.S. production capacity. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude 35 Table of Contents that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of December 30, 2006, we had net deferred tax assets of $54.9 million, consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill, property, plant and equipment, economic development funding and share based compensation. As of December 31, 2005, we had a deferred tax asset of $1.9 million consisting primarily of non U.S. net operating loss carry forwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are further described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are as follows: Revenue recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. In accordance with this policy, we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts. Our only significant revenue generating activity is the sale of our single type of solar module. We are able to determine that the criteria for revenue recognition have been met by examining objective data and the only estimates that we generally have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectibility of the resulting receivable. We have not experienced significant variability in our collections because we have historically sold our solar modules primarily to six well established customers. End of life reclamation and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for reclaiming and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives. We base our estimate of the fair value of our reclamation and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of reclaiming and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation site to a recycling center and the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk rate for such services. We based this estimate on our experience reclaiming and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be reclaimed and recycled. In the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the reclamation and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement. We charged $0.9 million and $2.5 million to cost of sales for the fair value of our reclamation and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006, respectively. During both the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006, the accretion expense on our reclamation and recycling obligations was insignificant. An increase of 10% or a decrease of 10% in our estimate of the future cost of reclaiming and recycling each solar module would result in a 10% increase or decrease, respectively, in our annual reclamation and recycling cost accrual; a 10% increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a 9% decrease in our estimated costs; and a 10% decrease in the rate would result in a 10% increase in the cost. 36 Table of Contents Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty to the original purchasers of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions. We also warrant to the original purchasers of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years. Our warranties may be transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by $1.0 million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty. During the year ended December 30, 2006, no further significant adjustment to this estimate was required. Stock based compensation. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards and we adopted SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2005 using the modified retrospective method of transition. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 107, which provides guidance regarding the implementation of SFAS 123(R). In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in stock based compensation valuation models, the classification of stock based compensation expense, the capitalization of stock based compensation costs and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis in filings with the SEC. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes Merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options, which is consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes Merton formula, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return. Because our stock has only recently become publicly traded, we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility; therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price. We estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding. If we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future stock based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards, even if the critical terms of the awards are similar. Higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of stock based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. These adjustments affect our cost of sales, research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 30, 2006, the adjustments to our forfeiture rate estimates reduced our share based compensation expense by $0.6 million; adjustments to our forfeiture rate estimates did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. Our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities. Our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules. We account for our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for 37 Table of Contents the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result, we assess long lived assets classified as held and used (including our property, plant and equipment) for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. We evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during 2006 and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of these assets are not recoverable. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations. Determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events, including the following: the amount, timing and character of deductions; permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law; and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions, or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets, liabilities, expenses and benefits that we record during any given period. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006: 2004 2005 2006 Net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of sales 139.4 % 65.5 % 59.8 % Gross profit (loss) (39.4 )% 34.5 % 40.2 % Research and development 9.2 % 5.0 % 4.7 % Selling, general and administrative 68.9 % 32.9 % 24.7 % Production start up expense 6.6 % 6.6 % 8.7 % Operating income (loss) (124.1 )% (10.0 )% 2.1 % Foreign currency gain (loss) 0.9 % (3.6 )% 4.1 % Interest expense (0.8 )% (0.9 )% (0.8 )% Other income (expense) (0.0 )% 0.9 % 1.4 % Income tax expense 3.9 % Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation 0.2 % Net income (loss) (124.0 )% (13.4 )% 2.9 % Fiscal Years Ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 Net sales Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 48,063 $ 134,974 $ 86,911 181 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 184% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2006 compared to 2005. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of higher throughput, our conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the full production ramp of our Ohio expansion. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 59 watts in 2005 to approximately 63 watts in 2006. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a 38 Table of Contents decrease in the average selling price per watt from $2.43 in 2005 to $2.39 in 2006. Our average selling price was positively impacted by $0.05 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and euro. Strong demand from other customers allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 45% of net sales in 2005 to 19% of net sales in 2006. In both periods, almost all of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 31,483 $ 80,730 $ 49,247 156 % % of net sales 65.5 % 59.8 % Direct material expense increased $21.6 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the reclamation and recycling of our solar modules increased $3.7 million, direct labor expense increased $3.9 million and sales freight and other costs increased $1.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes during 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $18.9 million, which was primarily comprised of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $8.7 million, including $3.3 million stock based compensation expense, resulting from the conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the overall infrastructure build out of our Ohio expansion, an increase in facility related expenses of $4.3 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.9 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio expansion. Gross profit Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 16,580 $ 54,244 $ 37,664 227 % gross margin % 34.5 % 40.2 % Gross profit increased by $37.7 million, or 227%, from $16.6 million in 2005 to $54.2 million in 2006, reflecting an increase in net sales. As a percentage of sales, gross margin increased 570 basis points from 34.5% in 2005 to 40.2% in 2006, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our Ohio expansion, which drove a 184% increase in the number of MW sold. Research and development Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 2,372 $ 6,361 $ 3,989 168 % % of net sales 5.0 % 4.7 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $3.2 million increase in personnel related expense, which included stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million in 2006 compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2005, due to increased headcount and additional option awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $0.7 million and grant revenue declined by $0.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Selling, general and administrative Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 15,825 $ 33,348 $ 17,523 111 % % of net sales 32.9 % 24.7 % 39 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $12.0 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in stock based compensation from $3.4 million in 2005 compared to $5.3 million in 2006. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $4.8 million and other expenses increased by $0.7 million during 2006 primarily resulting from expenses incurred in connection with being a public company. Production start up Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 3,173 $ 11,725 $ 8,552 270 % % of net sales 6.6 % 8.7 % In 2006, we incurred $11.7 million of production start up expenses to qualify our Ohio expansion and ramp our German plant, including related legal and regulatory costs and increased headcount, compared to $3.2 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio expansion during 2005. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses and management of our replication process. Foreign exchange gain (loss) Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain (loss) $ (1,715 ) $ 5,544 $ 7,259 N.M. Foreign exchange gain increased by $7.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of favorable currency translation between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Interest expense Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ (418 ) $ (1,023 ) $ (605 ) N.M. Interest expense increased by $0.6 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2006, we capitalized $3.3 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $0.4 million in 2005. Other income (expense), net Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other income (expense), net $ 372 $ 1,849 $ 1,477 397 % The increase in other income of $1.5 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances resulting from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006. Income tax expense Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax expense $ $ 5,206 $ 5,206 N.M. The increase in income tax expense was the result of a change in corporate form from a LLC to a C corporation, profitability in 2006 and continued full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 40 Table of Contents Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cumulative effect $ 89 $ $ (89 ) N.M. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) required a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options and resulted in a one time cumulative effect of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 Net sales Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 13,522 $ 48,063 $ 34,541 255 % Of the increase in our net sales, $26.8 million was due to an increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold from 2004 to 2005. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily because of increases in production capacity and sellable watts per solar module. In November 2004, we completed the qualification of our base plant for full volume production and then operated the base plant at a high throughput production rate for all of 2005. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 55 Watts in 2004 to approximately 59 Watts in 2005, resulting in an increase of $3.5 million in net sales. As a result of strong customer demand and the increased number of sellable watts per solar module, we increased the average sales price per Watt from $2.22 in 2004 to $2.43 in 2005, which increased net sales by $4.2 million. Strong demand from our other customers also allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 68.1% of net sales in 2004 to 45.1% of net sales in 2005. In 2005, 99.6% of our net sales resulted from shipments of solar modules to Germany, compared to 94.7% of our net sales in 2004. Cost of sales Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 18,851 $ 31,483 $ 12,632 67 % % of net sales 139.4 % 65.5 % The increase in our cost of sales was due primarily to higher raw material costs required to support the higher production volumes from the base plant. Direct materials increased by $7.3 million from 2004 to 2005. On a cost per solar module and cost per watt basis, raw material costs declined slightly from 2004 to 2005, primarily because of improved manufacturing yields and conversion efficiency. In addition, direct labor increased by $0.6 million and manufacturing overhead costs increased by $4.7 million from 2004 to 2005. This increase was driven by higher engineering expense, increased equipment maintenance and infrastructure build out and stock based compensation expense. Manufacturing overhead included $0.8 million of stock based compensation expense in 2005 compared to $0.1 million in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased by $1.4 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of depreciating the base plant for the entire fiscal year. We expensed $1.5 million less warranty and end of life program expenses in 2005 than in 2004, as a result of corrective actions implemented against production material defects encountered in 2004 and lower overall unit production costs. Gross profit (loss) Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit (loss) $ (5,329 ) $ 16,580 $ 21,909 N.M. gross margin % (39.4 )% 34.5 % 41 Table of Contents Gross profit increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes. Our gross margin improved from a negative 39.4% in 2004 to a positive 34.5% in 2005, because of improvements in our average sales price per watt, an increase in overall sellable watts due to efficiency gains and the economies of scale we realized from operating the base plant at full volume production through most of 2005. Research and development Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 1,240 $ 2,372 $ 1,132 91 % % of net sales 9.2 % 5.0 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in our development staffing during 2005, an increase of $0.5 million due to higher stock based compensation expense and an increase of $0.2 million due to an increase in consulting fees offset by a reduction of $0.1 million in facility expense. In addition, our grant revenue declined by $0.1 million in 2005, compared to 2004. Research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $0.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and administrative Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 9,312 $ 15,825 $ 6,513 70 % % of net sales 68.9 % 32.9 % $2.2 million of the increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses was the result of increased staffing levels, primarily in sales and marketing, to support higher sales volumes in Germany. In addition, spending for professional services increased by $1.0 million, travel expenses increased by $0.4 million and facilities expense increased by $0.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Stock based compensation expense increased by $2.4 million, from $1.0 million in 2004 to $3.4 million in 2005.

Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses and the management of our replication process. Foreign exchange gain (loss) Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain (loss) $ 116 $ (1,715 ) $ (1,831 ) N.M. Foreign exchange losses increased by $1.8 million during 2005 as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro. 42 Table of Contents Interest expense Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ (100 ) $ (418 ) $ (318 ) N.M. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowings under various notes totaling $28.7 million at the end of 2005 compared to $13.7 million at the end of 2004. In 2005 we capitalized $0.4 million of interest expense in construction in progress compared to $0.3 million in 2004.

The adoption of SFAS 123(R) requires a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options, resulting in a one time cumulative effect of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, borrowings from JWMA Partners, LLC (JWMA) and its affiliates, borrowings from Goldman, Sachs & Co., equity contributions from JWMA and borrowings from local governments and other sources to fund plant expansions. During the year ended December 30, 2006, we received $302.7 million as the net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock and as of December 30, 2006, we had $308.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. One of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines, such as the German plant currently under construction and a new manufacturing plant in Malaysia. We expect that each four line manufacturing facility will require a capital expenditure of approximately $150.0 million to complete. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and government grants and low interest debt financings for our German plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan. As a result, we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future that would result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. See Item 1A: Risk Factors Our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner, both of which are subject risks and uncertainties. 43 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash provided (used) was as follows for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006 (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 Operating activities $ (15,185 ) $ 5,040 $ (576 ) Investing activities (7,790 ) (43,832 ) (159,994 ) Financing activities 22,900 51,663 451,550 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows (187 ) 385 391 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (262 ) $ 13,256 $ 291,371 Operating activities Cash used in operating activities was $0.6 million during 2006 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 million during 2005. During 2006 cash received from customers increased by $60.6 million to $110.2 million mainly due to increased accounts receivable resulting from higher revenues. This increase was offset by cash paid to suppliers and employees of $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in inventories to support revenue growth and other costs supporting our global expansion. Operating activities provided cash of $5.0 million during 2005 and used cash of $15.2 million during 2004. The increase of $20.2 million in cash provided by operating activities from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of an increase in cash received from our customers. The cash we received from our customers increased because our net sales increased by $34.5 million from 2004 to 2005 and our accounts receivable decreased by $3.3 million during the same period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in cash paid to our suppliers and employees as a result of higher production volumes and an increase in inventory. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $160.0 million during 2006 compared to $43.8 million during 2005. Cash used for investing activities during 2006 was composed of $153.2 million in capital expenditures for our German plant and the Ohio expansion and $6.8 million in cash placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module reclamation and recycling program, to secure our construction loan for the German plant and to secure an inventory supply contract. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash used in investing activities during 2005 was composed of $42.5 million in capital expenditures for our Ohio expansion, $1.3 million deposited with an insurance company as part of our solar module reclamation and recycling program and $0.1 million used for other capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million during 2005 compared to $7.8 million during 2004. During 2004, cash used in investing activities was composed of $7.7 million used to purchase equipment for our base plant in Ohio and $0.1 million used for investments into other long term assets. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $451.6 million during 2006 compared to $51.7 million during 2005. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions by JWMA of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts were the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs & Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. During 2005, cash provided by financing activities was 44 Table of Contents primarily the result of a $20.0 million loan from a related party, a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio and a $16.7 million cash equity contribution by JWMA. Cash generated from financing activities was $51.7 million during 2005 compared to $22.9 million during 2004. During 2004, cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio and a $17.9 million cash equity contribution by JWMA. On October 24, 2006, we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 and up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.001. These amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers, preferences and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue. On October 30, 2006, our board of directors approved a 4.85 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares, which was effective November 1, 2006; the par value of our common shares remained $0.001 per share and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 30, 2006, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements.

Debt and Credit Sources On July 27, 2006, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Solar, Inc., entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG under which we can draw up to 102.0 million ($132.6 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) to fund costs of constructing and starting up our German plant. This credit facility consists of a term loan of up to 53.0 million ($68.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) and a revolving credit facility of 27.0 million ($35.1 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). The facility also provides for a bridge loan, which we can draw against to fund construction costs that we later expect to be reimbursed through funding from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen), of up to 22.0 million ($28.6 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). We can make drawdowns against the term loan and the bridge loan until December 30, 2007 and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until 45 Table of Contents September 30, 2012. We have incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling $2.0 million as of December 30, 2006, which we will recognize as interest and other financing expenses over the time that borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility. We also pay an annual commitment fee of 0.6% of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility. At December 30, 2006, we had outstanding borrowings of $45.2 million under the term loan, which we classify as long term debt and $16.3 million under the bridge loan, which we classify as short term debt. We had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 30, 2006. We must repay the term loan in twenty quarterly payments beginning on March 31, 2008 and ending on December 30, 2012. We must repay the bridge loan with any funding we receive from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005, but in any event, the bridge loan must be paid in full by December 30, 2008. Once repaid, we may not draw again against term loan or bridge loan facilities. The revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by December 30, 2012. In certain circumstances, we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments and during 2009 we will also be required to make a one time principal repayment equal to 20% of any surplus cash flow of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH during 2008. Surplus cash flow is a term defined in the credit facility agreement that is approximately equal to cash flow from operating activities less required payments on indebtedness. We pay interest at the annual rate of the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) plus 1.6% on the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% on the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% on the revolving credit facility. Each time we make a draw against the term loan or the bridge loan, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every three or six months; each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one, three, or six months. The credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps covering at least 75% of the balance outstanding under the term loan. The Federal Republic of Germany is guaranteeing 48% of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the State of Brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32%. We pay an annual fee, not to exceed 0.5 million ($0.7 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) for these guarantees. In addition, we must maintain a debt service reserve of 3.0 million ($3.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) in a restricted bank account, which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility. Substantially all of our assets in Germany, including the German plant, have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees. The credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flow available for debt service must be at least 1.1 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may not exceed 3.0:1 from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008, 2.5:1 from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 and 1.5:1 from January 1, 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility. The credit facility also contains various non financial covenants with which we must comply. We must submit various financial reports, financial calculations and statistics, operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender. We must adequately insure our German operation and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems. Also, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH cannot open any bank accounts (other than those required by the credit facility), enter into any financial liabilities (other than intercompany obligations or those liabilities required by the credit facility), sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business, make any loans or guarantees to third parties, or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors. Our ability to withdraw cash from First Solar Manufacturing GmbH for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flows from operations must generally be used for the payment of loan interest, fees and principal before any remainder can be used to pay intercompany charges, loans, or dividends. Furthermore, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 1.3 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30% of the amount of its total 46 Table of Contents assets. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2% to First Solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products. Also, we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, such as if project related costs exceed our plan, we do not recover the expected amounts from governmental investment subsidies, or all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn. If there is a decline in the value of the assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility, we may also be required to pledge additional assets as collateral. On July 26, 2006, we were approved to receive taxable investment incentives (Investitionszuschsse) of approximately 21.5 million ($28.0 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) from the State of Brandenburg, Germany. These funds will reimburse us for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Receipt of these incentives is conditional upon the State of Brandenburg, Germany having sufficient funds allocated to this program to pay the reimbursements we claim. In addition, we are required to operate our facility for a minimum of five years and employ a specified number of employees during this period. Our incentive approval expires on December 31, 2009. As of December 30, 2006, we had received $16.8 million under this program and we had accrued an additional $4.0 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date. We are eligible to recover up to approximately 23.8 million ($30.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) of expenditures related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany under the German Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen). This Act permits us to claim tax exempt reimbursements for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Tangible assets subsidized under this program have to remain in the region for at least 5 years. In accordance with the administrative requirements of the Act, we plan to claim reimbursement under the Act in conjunction with the filing of our tax returns with the local German tax office. Therefore we do not expect to receive funding from this program until we file our annual tax return for fiscal 2006 in 2007. In addition, this program expired on December 31, 2006 and we can only claim reimbursement for investments completed by this date. The majority of our buildings and structures and our investment in machinery and equipment were completed by this date. As of December 30, 2006, we had accrued $23.5 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date. During July 2006, we entered into a loan agreement, which we amended and restated on August 7, 2006, with the Estate of John T. Walton under which we could draw up to $34.0 million. Interest was payable monthly at the annual rate of the commercial prime lending rate; principal was to be repaid at the earlier of January 2008 or the completion of an initial public offering of our stock. This loan did not have any collateral requirements. As a condition of obtaining this loan, we were required to use a portion of the proceeds to repay the principal of our loan from Kingston Properties, LLC, a related party. During July 2006, we drew $26.0 million against this loan, $8.7 million of which we used to repay the Kingston Properties, LLC loan. Upon completion of our initial public offering in November 2006, we repaid the entire $26.0 million loan balance. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, $14.9 million of which was outstanding at December 30, 2006. Interest is payable monthly at the annual rate of 2.25%; principal payments commenced on December 1, 2006 and end on July 1, 2015. Land and buildings at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $21.6 million at December 30, 2006 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. During the year ended December 25, 2004, we received a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, all of which was outstanding at December 30, 2006. Interest is payable monthly at annual rates starting at 0.25% during the first year the loan is outstanding, increasing to 1.25% during the second and third years, increasing to 2.25% during the fourth and fifth years and increasing to 3.25% for each subsequent year; principal payments commence on January 1, 2007 and end on December 1, 2009. Machinery and equipment at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $9.8 million at December 30, 2006 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. Due to the preparation of our registration statement, we did not meet the non financial covenant to furnish our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the lender within 120 days after our fiscal year end and we 47 Table of Contents received a waiver for that requirement from the lender on June 5, 2006. We have subsequently provided these financial statements to the lender. On May 14, 2003, First Solar Property, LLC issued a $8.7 million promissory note due June 1, 2010 to Kingston Properties, LLC. The interest rate of the note was 3.70% per annum. We pre paid this note in full in July 2006. On February 22, 2006, we received $73.3 million from the issuance of $74.0 million of convertible senior subordinated notes, less $0.7 million of issuance costs, to Goldman, Sachs & Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 30, 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See note 2 to the consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for approximately 95.0% of our net sales in 2006 and 99.6% of our net sales in 2005. In 2006 and 2005, all of our international sales were denominated in euro. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains and losses from the time we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, we recently entered into our Long Term Supply Contracts. These contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. In 2006, a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by $13.1 million. In the past, exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our cash flows by $0.4 million in 2005 and 2006. Although we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we may have increased risk associated with currency fluctuations in the future. As of December 30, 2006, we did not engage in hedging activities; however, our expenditures denominated in euro are increasing due to the construction of our German plant and capital equipment purchases from German suppliers. Most of the German plants operating expenses will be in euro, creating increasing opportunities for some natural hedge against the currency risk in our net sales. In addition, we may decide to enter into other hedging activities in the future. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our end users depend on debt financing to purchase and install a photovoltaic system. Although the useful life of a photovoltaic system is approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the photovoltaic system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our end users rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure and final project. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a photovoltaic system on favorable terms, or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install photovoltaic systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a photovoltaic system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to photovoltaic systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. 48 Table of Contents During July 2006, we entered into the IKB credit facility, which bears interest at Euribor plus 1.6% for the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% for the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% for the revolving credit facility. We entered into three interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable interest on the IKB term loan of Euribor plus 1.6% to fixed interest rates. At December 30, 2006, the notional value of our interest rate swaps were 28.8 million ($37.4 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). Commodity Risk We are exposed to price risks associated with raw material purchases, most significantly tellurium. Currently, we purchase all of our cadmium telluride in manufactured form from two qualified manufacturers, but we plan to qualify additional manufacturers. We have a three year written contract with our qualified supplier, which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium. As other suppliers become qualified, we will purchase cadmium telluride from our other qualified supplier under quarterly purchase orders. In 2006, we entered into a multi year tellurium supply contract in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We acquire the remainder of our raw materials under quarterly or annual purchase orders, at prices based on annual volumes. Because the sale prices of solar modules in our Long Term Supply Contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our supply contracts, we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of our raw materials to our customers. In addition, most of our key raw materials are either sole sourced or sourced by a limited number of third party suppliers. As a result, the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations. If our existing suppliers fail to perform, we will be required to identify and qualify new suppliers, a process that can take between one and twelve months depending on the raw material. We might be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production line in a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms. 49 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions as described under the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview We design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world. Each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. We manufacture our solar modules on a high throughput production line and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated, continuous process. In 2006, we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany. 30 Table of Contents Currently, we manufacture our solar modules and conduct our research and development activities at our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility. We completed the qualification of our base plant in Perrysburg for high volume production in November 2004. During 2005, the first full year our base plant operated at high volume production, we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to $1.59, from $2.94 in 2004. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to $1.40 in 2006. We define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period, including stock based compensation expense relating to our adoption of SFAS 123(R), divided by the total watts produced during the period. By continuing to expand globally production and improve our technology and manufacturing process, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt. Our objective is to become, by 2010, the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that competes on a non subsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets in the United States, Europe and Asia. To approach the price of retail electricity in such markets, we believe that we will need to reduce our manufacturing costs per watt by an additional 40 50%, assuming prices for traditional energy sources remain flat on an inflation adjusted basis. First Solar was founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research, development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in January 2002. From January 2002 to the end of 2005, we sold approximately 28MW of solar modules. During 2006, we sold approximately 56MW of solar modules. We converted, on February 22, 2006, from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. Prior that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2006, all references to fiscal year 2005 relate to the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2005 and all references to fiscal year 2004 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 25, 2004. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity We commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in Perrysburg, Ohio in January 2002. During 2003 and 2004, while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line, we designed the base plant, a replicable, high throughput production line. We ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into the base plant, completing the qualification of the base plant for full volume production in November 2004. The base plant has an expected annual capacity of 25MW. In February 2005, we commenced construction of two additional 25MW production lines at our Perrysburg, Ohio facility, which we refer to as our Ohio expansion. We completed the qualification of the Ohio expansion for full volume production in August 2006. During the construction of the Ohio expansion, we improved certain aspects of the base plant, including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment. Our two line Ohio expansion represents a standard building block for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities. In February 2006, we commenced construction of our German plant, a new manufacturing facility located in Frankfurt (Oder), in the State of Brandenburg, Germany that will house four 25MW production lines for a total of 100 MW name plate capacity. We anticipate completing the qualification of the German plant for full volume production during the second half of 2007. On January 24, 2007, we entered into a lease for a site in the Kulim Hi Tech Park in Kadah State, Malaysia where we plan to start construction of a four line 100MW plant in the second quarter of 2007. 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our current and in process production capacity: Annual Production Capacity of Date Qualification Number of Manufacturing Facility(1) Completed for Production Number of Solar Full Volume Manufacturing Facility Lines Modules Watts Production Base plant 1 400,000 25MW November 2004 Ohio expansion 2 800,000 50MW August 2006 German plant 4 1,600,000 100MW Second half of 2007 (2) Malaysia plant 4 1,600,000 100MW Second half of 2008 (2) Total Current and Planned 11 4,400,000 275MW (1) The annual capacity of our manufacturing facilities is based on an annual run rate of 400,000 solar modules per production line and a power rating of approximately 62 watts per solar module. (2) Anticipated. Each production line currently has an annual production capacity of 400,000 solar modules, representing 25MW. We anticipate that we will be able to increase both the run rate and MW volume of our existing production lines through our continuous improvement program. For example, we increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from approximately 7% in 2003 to approximately 9% at the end of 2006, thereby increasing the number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 49 watts to approximately 64 Watts. Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. Net Sales We generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules. Over the past three years, the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce. We price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. For example, our average sales price was $2.39 per watt during the 2006. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts. We currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany, which then resell our solar modules to end users who receive government subsidies. Our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in Europe, the United States, or Asia or if interest rates increase, which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects. In April 2006, we entered into contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European project developers and system integrators. We refer to these as our Long Term Sales Contracts. These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2006 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance. The initial terms of the Long Term Sales Contracts allowed us to deliver 795MW of solar modules from 2006 through 2011, which would generate 1.2 billion ($1.6 billion at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) of sales over that period based on the contractual pricing. In December 2006, we exercised our option under each of the Long Term Sales Contracts to increase the sales volumes that we can deliver, starting in 2008 and to extend each contract through 2012. We also amended the Long Term Sales Contracts with four of our customers in January 2007 to further increase the sales volumes that we can deliver over the duration of each contract. As a result of the option exercises and amendments as of January 9, 2007 our long term supply contracts allowed for approximately 2.3 billion ($3.0 billion at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) in sales from 2006 to 2012 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 1,554MW of solar modules, of which 50MW was sold in 2006. Our Long Term Supply Contracts require us to deliver solar modules each year that, in total, meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year. We are required to increase the minimum 32 Table of Contents average number of watts per module by approximately 5% annually between 2007 and 2009, and then by an additional 3% for modules delivered in 2012. If we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year, we will be in breach of the agreements, entitling our customers to certain remedies, potentially including the right to terminate their Long Term Supply Contracts. In addition, our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 6.5% each year through the expiration date of the contract in 2012. Because these sales prices under our Long Term Sales Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to our customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Sales Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin. The annual 6.5% decline in the sales price under the Long Term Sales Contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 5 6% each year, assuming that rated power of our solar modules remains flat and will impact our cash flow accordingly. As a result, our gross profit and gross margin could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual prices decrease. Furthermore, the sales prices under the Long Term Sales Contracts are denominated in Euros, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Under the Long Term Sales Contracts, starting in April 2006, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Under our customer contracts in effect prior to April 1, 2006, we did not transfer title or risk of loss, or recognize revenue, until the solar modules were received by our customers. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. We retain the right to terminate the Long Term Sales Contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that any of the following material adverse changes have occurred: new laws, rules or regulations with respect to our production, distribution, installation, or reclamation and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business; unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread, persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels; or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor, materials, or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput. The average termination fee under those agreements was 2.8 million ($3.6 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) under the initial contracts and is now 3.8 million ($4.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) following our exercise of the option to increase our volume commitments. Our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts to be negotiated with each of the customers and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the case of a late delivery, our customers are entitled to a maximum charge of up to 6% of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments or the minimum average watt per module, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. We estimate that the total sales volume under our Long Term Sales Contracts will account for approximately two thirds of our planned production volumes from our base plant in Ohio, Ohio expansion plant and German plant and also some of our planned production from our Malaysian plant. We spent $70.1 million in capital expenditures for the Ohio expansion. We are committing $150.0 million for the build out of our German plant through 2007 and anticipate that the build out of our Malaysian plant will require approximately $150.0 million through 2008. The information about our Long Term Supply Contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the Long Term Supply Contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results, including revenues or profitability. No single customer accounted for more than 20% of our net sales in 2006. Cost of sales Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials, such as tempered back glass, TCO coated front glass, cadmium telluride, EVA laminate, connector assemblies and laminate edge seal. Our total material cost per solar 33 Table of Contents module has been stable over the past three years, even though the cost of tellurium, a component of cadmium telluride, increased by approximately three times from 2003 to 2006. The increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs. Historically, we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials. In 2006, however, we entered into a multi year tellurium supply contract in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase. Other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and end of life reclamation and recycling expenses to our cost of sales. We implemented a program in 2005 to reclaim and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our reclamation and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their use and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be recycled and the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our program or another program that we approve. The photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation. We record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per line, geographic diversification and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Gross profits are affected by a number of factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our actual manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. For example, our long term customer contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines 6.5% each year. Another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production due to a lesser absorption of fixed cost until full production volumes are reached. As a result, gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. In 2006, we began adding equipment for further process developments and recording the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense. We may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the Ohio expansion to research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and manufacturing processes. As of December 30, 2006, we had a total of 34 employees working on these research and development activities. In addition, we maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. During the past three years, we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs. We received $1.0 million in research and development grants during 2004 and $0.9 million each during 2005 and 2006. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. 34 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts sold increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. We incurred production start up expenses of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2005 and $11.7 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the qualification of the Ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the German plant. We also expect to incur significant production start up expenses in fiscal year 2007 in connection with the German plant and the Malaysian plant. In general, we expect production start up expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entire new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of a new production line at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required. Over time, we expect production start up expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Interest expense Interest expense is associated with various debt financings. See Debt and Credit Sources. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. Other income (expense) Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Income Taxes First Solar, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on February 22, 2006. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to federal and state income taxes. Prior to February 22, 2006, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes. As a result, the annual historical financial data included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been, had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year. On December 30, 2006, we had non U.S. net operating loss carry forwards of $6.4 million, which have an unlimited expiration period, compared to $3.4 million on December 31, 2005. Our ability to use these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws. Certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions. We expect the tax consequences of our non U.S. subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our non U.S. production capacity. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude 35 Table of Contents that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of December 30, 2006, we had net deferred tax assets of $54.9 million, consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill, property, plant and equipment, economic development funding and share based compensation. As of December 31, 2005, we had a deferred tax asset of $1.9 million consisting primarily of non U.S. net operating loss carry forwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are further described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are as follows: Revenue recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. In accordance with this policy, we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts. Our only significant revenue generating activity is the sale of our single type of solar module. We are able to determine that the criteria for revenue recognition have been met by examining objective data and the only estimates that we generally have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectibility of the resulting receivable. We have not experienced significant variability in our collections because we have historically sold our solar modules primarily to six well established customers. End of life reclamation and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for reclaiming and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives. We base our estimate of the fair value of our reclamation and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of reclaiming and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation site to a recycling center and the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk rate for such services. We based this estimate on our experience reclaiming and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be reclaimed and recycled. In the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the reclamation and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement. We charged $0.9 million and $2.5 million to cost of sales for the fair value of our reclamation and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006, respectively. During both the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006, the accretion expense on our reclamation and recycling obligations was insignificant. An increase of 10% or a decrease of 10% in our estimate of the future cost of reclaiming and recycling each solar module would result in a 10% increase or decrease, respectively, in our annual reclamation and recycling cost accrual; a 10% increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a 9% decrease in our estimated costs; and a 10% decrease in the rate would result in a 10% increase in the cost. 36 Table of Contents Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty to the original purchasers of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions. We also warrant to the original purchasers of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years. Our warranties may be transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by $1.0 million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty. During the year ended December 30, 2006, no further significant adjustment to this estimate was required. Stock based compensation. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards and we adopted SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2005 using the modified retrospective method of transition. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 107, which provides guidance regarding the implementation of SFAS 123(R). In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in stock based compensation valuation models, the classification of stock based compensation expense, the capitalization of stock based compensation costs and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis in filings with the SEC. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes Merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options, which is consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes Merton formula, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return. Because our stock has only recently become publicly traded, we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility; therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price. We estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding. If we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future stock based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards, even if the critical terms of the awards are similar. Higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of stock based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. These adjustments affect our cost of sales, research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 30, 2006, the adjustments to our forfeiture rate estimates reduced our share based compensation expense by $0.6 million; adjustments to our forfeiture rate estimates did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. Our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities. Our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules. We account for our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for 37 Table of Contents the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result, we assess long lived assets classified as held and used (including our property, plant and equipment) for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. We evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during 2006 and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of these assets are not recoverable. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations. Determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events, including the following: the amount, timing and character of deductions; permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law; and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions, or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets, liabilities, expenses and benefits that we record during any given period. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006: 2004 2005 2006 Net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of sales 139.4 % 65.5 % 59.8 % Gross profit (loss) (39.4 )% 34.5 % 40.2 % Research and development 9.2 % 5.0 % 4.7 % Selling, general and administrative 68.9 % 32.9 % 24.7 % Production start up expense 6.6 % 6.6 % 8.7 % Operating income (loss) (124.1 )% (10.0 )% 2.1 % Foreign currency gain (loss) 0.9 % (3.6 )% 4.1 % Interest expense (0.8 )% (0.9 )% (0.8 )% Other income (expense) (0.0 )% 0.9 % 1.4 % Income tax expense 3.9 % Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation 0.2 % Net income (loss) (124.0 )% (13.4 )% 2.9 % Fiscal Years Ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 Net sales Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 48,063 $ 134,974 $ 86,911 181 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 184% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2006 compared to 2005. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of higher throughput, our conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the full production ramp of our Ohio expansion. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 59 watts in 2005 to approximately 63 watts in 2006. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a 38 Table of Contents decrease in the average selling price per watt from $2.43 in 2005 to $2.39 in 2006. Our average selling price was positively impacted by $0.05 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and euro. Strong demand from other customers allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 45% of net sales in 2005 to 19% of net sales in 2006. In both periods, almost all of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 31,483 $ 80,730 $ 49,247 156 % % of net sales 65.5 % 59.8 % Direct material expense increased $21.6 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the reclamation and recycling of our solar modules increased $3.7 million, direct labor expense increased $3.9 million and sales freight and other costs increased $1.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes during 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $18.9 million, which was primarily comprised of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $8.7 million, including $3.3 million stock based compensation expense, resulting from the conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the overall infrastructure build out of our Ohio expansion, an increase in facility related expenses of $4.3 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.9 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio expansion. Gross profit Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 16,580 $ 54,244 $ 37,664 227 % gross margin % 34.5 % 40.2 % Gross profit increased by $37.7 million, or 227%, from $16.6 million in 2005 to $54.2 million in 2006, reflecting an increase in net sales. As a percentage of sales, gross margin increased 570 basis points from 34.5% in 2005 to 40.2% in 2006, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our Ohio expansion, which drove a 184% increase in the number of MW sold. Research and development Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 2,372 $ 6,361 $ 3,989 168 % % of net sales 5.0 % 4.7 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $3.2 million increase in personnel related expense, which included stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million in 2006 compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2005, due to increased headcount and additional option awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $0.7 million and grant revenue declined by $0.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Selling, general and administrative Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 15,825 $ 33,348 $ 17,523 111 % % of net sales 32.9 % 24.7 % 39 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $12.0 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in stock based compensation from $3.4 million in 2005 compared to $5.3 million in 2006. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $4.8 million and other expenses increased by $0.7 million during 2006 primarily resulting from expenses incurred in connection with being a public company. Production start up Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 3,173 $ 11,725 $ 8,552 270 % % of net sales 6.6 % 8.7 % In 2006, we incurred $11.7 million of production start up expenses to qualify our Ohio expansion and ramp our German plant, including related legal and regulatory costs and increased headcount, compared to $3.2 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio expansion during 2005. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses and management of our replication process. Foreign exchange gain (loss) Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain (loss) $ (1,715 ) $ 5,544 $ 7,259 N.M. Foreign exchange gain increased by $7.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of favorable currency translation between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Interest expense Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ (418 ) $ (1,023 ) $ (605 ) N.M. Interest expense increased by $0.6 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2006, we capitalized $3.3 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $0.4 million in 2005. Other income (expense), net Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other income (expense), net $ 372 $ 1,849 $ 1,477 397 % The increase in other income of $1.5 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances resulting from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006. Income tax expense Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax expense $ $ 5,206 $ 5,206 N.M. The increase in income tax expense was the result of a change in corporate form from a LLC to a C corporation, profitability in 2006 and continued full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 40 Table of Contents Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation Year Over 2005 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cumulative effect $ 89 $ $ (89 ) N.M. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) required a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options and resulted in a one time cumulative effect of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 Net sales Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 13,522 $ 48,063 $ 34,541 255 % Of the increase in our net sales, $26.8 million was due to an increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold from 2004 to 2005. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily because of increases in production capacity and sellable watts per solar module. In November 2004, we completed the qualification of our base plant for full volume production and then operated the base plant at a high throughput production rate for all of 2005. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 55 Watts in 2004 to approximately 59 Watts in 2005, resulting in an increase of $3.5 million in net sales. As a result of strong customer demand and the increased number of sellable watts per solar module, we increased the average sales price per Watt from $2.22 in 2004 to $2.43 in 2005, which increased net sales by $4.2 million. Strong demand from our other customers also allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 68.1% of net sales in 2004 to 45.1% of net sales in 2005. In 2005, 99.6% of our net sales resulted from shipments of solar modules to Germany, compared to 94.7% of our net sales in 2004. Cost of sales Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 18,851 $ 31,483 $ 12,632 67 % % of net sales 139.4 % 65.5 % The increase in our cost of sales was due primarily to higher raw material costs required to support the higher production volumes from the base plant. Direct materials increased by $7.3 million from 2004 to 2005. On a cost per solar module and cost per watt basis, raw material costs declined slightly from 2004 to 2005, primarily because of improved manufacturing yields and conversion efficiency. In addition, direct labor increased by $0.6 million and manufacturing overhead costs increased by $4.7 million from 2004 to 2005. This increase was driven by higher engineering expense, increased equipment maintenance and infrastructure build out and stock based compensation expense. Manufacturing overhead included $0.8 million of stock based compensation expense in 2005 compared to $0.1 million in 2004. Depreciation expense also increased by $1.4 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of depreciating the base plant for the entire fiscal year. We expensed $1.5 million less warranty and end of life program expenses in 2005 than in 2004, as a result of corrective actions implemented against production material defects encountered in 2004 and lower overall unit production costs. Gross profit (loss) Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit (loss) $ (5,329 ) $ 16,580 $ 21,909 N.M. gross margin % (39.4 )% 34.5 % 41 Table of Contents Gross profit increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes. Our gross margin improved from a negative 39.4% in 2004 to a positive 34.5% in 2005, because of improvements in our average sales price per watt, an increase in overall sellable watts due to efficiency gains and the economies of scale we realized from operating the base plant at full volume production through most of 2005. Research and development Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 1,240 $ 2,372 $ 1,132 91 % % of net sales 9.2 % 5.0 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in our development staffing during 2005, an increase of $0.5 million due to higher stock based compensation expense and an increase of $0.2 million due to an increase in consulting fees offset by a reduction of $0.1 million in facility expense. In addition, our grant revenue declined by $0.1 million in 2005, compared to 2004. Research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of $0.6 million and $0.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and administrative Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 9,312 $ 15,825 $ 6,513 70 % % of net sales 68.9 % 32.9 % $2.2 million of the increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses was the result of increased staffing levels, primarily in sales and marketing, to support higher sales volumes in Germany. In addition, spending for professional services increased by $1.0 million, travel expenses increased by $0.4 million and facilities expense increased by $0.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Stock based compensation expense increased by $2.4 million, from $1.0 million in 2004 to $3.4 million in 2005. Production start up Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 900 $ 3,173 $ 2,273 253 % % of net sales 6.6 % 6.6 % The increase in production start up expenses from $0.9 million in 2004 compared to $3.2 million in 2005 was due to the build out of our Ohio expansion in 2005. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses and the management of our replication process. Foreign exchange gain (loss) Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain (loss) $ 116 $ (1,715 ) $ (1,831 ) N.M. Foreign exchange losses increased by $1.8 million during 2005 as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the euro. 42 Table of Contents Interest expense Year Over 2004 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ (100 ) $ (418 ) $ (318 ) N.M. Interest expense increased due to increased borrowings under various notes totaling $28.7 million at the end of 2005 compared to $13.7 million at the end of 2004. In 2005 we capitalized $0.4 million of interest expense in construction in progress compared to $0.3 million in 2004.

The adoption of SFAS 123(R) requires a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options, resulting in a one time cumulative effect of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, borrowings from JWMA Partners, LLC (JWMA) and its affiliates, borrowings from Goldman, Sachs & Co., equity contributions from JWMA and borrowings from local governments and other sources to fund plant expansions. During the year ended December 30, 2006, we received $302.7 million as the net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock and as of December 30, 2006, we had $308.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. One of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines, such as the German plant currently under construction and a new manufacturing plant in Malaysia. We expect that each four line manufacturing facility will require a capital expenditure of approximately $150.0 million to complete. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and government grants and low interest debt financings for our German plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan. As a result, we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future that would result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. See Item 1A: Risk Factors Our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner, both of which are subject risks and uncertainties. 43 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash provided (used) was as follows for the years ended December 25, 2004, December 31, 2005 and December 30, 2006 (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 Operating activities $ (15,185 ) $ 5,040 $ (576 ) Investing activities (7,790 ) (43,832 ) (159,994 ) Financing activities 22,900 51,663 451,550 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows (187 ) 385 391 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (262 ) $ 13,256 $ 291,371 Operating activities Cash used in operating activities was $0.6 million during 2006 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 million during 2005. During 2006 cash received from customers increased by $60.6 million to $110.2 million mainly due to increased accounts receivable resulting from higher revenues. This increase was offset by cash paid to suppliers and employees of $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in inventories to support revenue growth and other costs supporting our global expansion. Operating activities provided cash of $5.0 million during 2005 and used cash of $15.2 million during 2004. The increase of $20.2 million in cash provided by operating activities from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of an increase in cash received from our customers. The cash we received from our customers increased because our net sales increased by $34.5 million from 2004 to 2005 and our accounts receivable decreased by $3.3 million during the same period. These factors were partially offset by an increase in cash paid to our suppliers and employees as a result of higher production volumes and an increase in inventory. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $160.0 million during 2006 compared to $43.8 million during 2005. Cash used for investing activities during 2006 was composed of $153.2 million in capital expenditures for our German plant and the Ohio expansion and $6.8 million in cash placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module reclamation and recycling program, to secure our construction loan for the German plant and to secure an inventory supply contract. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash used in investing activities during 2005 was composed of $42.5 million in capital expenditures for our Ohio expansion, $1.3 million deposited with an insurance company as part of our solar module reclamation and recycling program and $0.1 million used for other capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million during 2005 compared to $7.8 million during 2004. During 2004, cash used in investing activities was composed of $7.7 million used to purchase equipment for our base plant in Ohio and $0.1 million used for investments into other long term assets. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $451.6 million during 2006 compared to $51.7 million during 2005. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions by JWMA of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts were the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs & Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. During 2005, cash provided by financing activities was 44 Table of Contents primarily the result of a $20.0 million loan from a related party, a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio and a $16.7 million cash equity contribution by JWMA. Cash generated from financing activities was $51.7 million during 2005 compared to $22.9 million during 2004. During 2004, cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio and a $17.9 million cash equity contribution by JWMA. On October 24, 2006, we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 and up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.001. These amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers, preferences and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue. On October 30, 2006, our board of directors approved a 4.85 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares, which was effective November 1, 2006; the par value of our common shares remained $0.001 per share and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 30, 2006, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements.

Debt and Credit Sources On July 27, 2006, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Solar, Inc., entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG under which we can draw up to 102.0 million ($132.6 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) to fund costs of constructing and starting up our German plant. This credit facility consists of a term loan of up to 53.0 million ($68.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) and a revolving credit facility of 27.0 million ($35.1 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). The facility also provides for a bridge loan, which we can draw against to fund construction costs that we later expect to be reimbursed through funding from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen), of up to 22.0 million ($28.6 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). We can make drawdowns against the term loan and the bridge loan until December 30, 2007 and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until 45 Table of Contents September 30, 2012. We have incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling $2.0 million as of December 30, 2006, which we will recognize as interest and other financing expenses over the time that borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility. We also pay an annual commitment fee of 0.6% of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility. At December 30, 2006, we had outstanding borrowings of $45.2 million under the term loan, which we classify as long term debt and $16.3 million under the bridge loan, which we classify as short term debt. We had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 30, 2006. We must repay the term loan in twenty quarterly payments beginning on March 31, 2008 and ending on December 30, 2012. We must repay the bridge loan with any funding we receive from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005, but in any event, the bridge loan must be paid in full by December 30, 2008. Once repaid, we may not draw again against term loan or bridge loan facilities. The revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by December 30, 2012. In certain circumstances, we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments and during 2009 we will also be required to make a one time principal repayment equal to 20% of any surplus cash flow of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH during 2008. Surplus cash flow is a term defined in the credit facility agreement that is approximately equal to cash flow from operating activities less required payments on indebtedness. We pay interest at the annual rate of the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) plus 1.6% on the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% on the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% on the revolving credit facility. Each time we make a draw against the term loan or the bridge loan, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every three or six months; each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one, three, or six months. The credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps covering at least 75% of the balance outstanding under the term loan. The Federal Republic of Germany is guaranteeing 48% of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the State of Brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32%. We pay an annual fee, not to exceed 0.5 million ($0.7 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) for these guarantees. In addition, we must maintain a debt service reserve of 3.0 million ($3.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) in a restricted bank account, which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility. Substantially all of our assets in Germany, including the German plant, have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees. The credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flow available for debt service must be at least 1.1 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may not exceed 3.0:1 from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008, 2.5:1 from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 and 1.5:1 from January 1, 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility. The credit facility also contains various non financial covenants with which we must comply. We must submit various financial reports, financial calculations and statistics, operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender. We must adequately insure our German operation and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems. Also, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH cannot open any bank accounts (other than those required by the credit facility), enter into any financial liabilities (other than intercompany obligations or those liabilities required by the credit facility), sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business, make any loans or guarantees to third parties, or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors. Our ability to withdraw cash from First Solar Manufacturing GmbH for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flows from operations must generally be used for the payment of loan interest, fees and principal before any remainder can be used to pay intercompany charges, loans, or dividends. Furthermore, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 1.3 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30% of the amount of its total 46 Table of Contents assets. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2% to First Solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products. Also, we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, such as if project related costs exceed our plan, we do not recover the expected amounts from governmental investment subsidies, or all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn. If there is a decline in the value of the assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility, we may also be required to pledge additional assets as collateral. On July 26, 2006, we were approved to receive taxable investment incentives (Investitionszuschsse) of approximately 21.5 million ($28.0 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) from the State of Brandenburg, Germany. These funds will reimburse us for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Receipt of these incentives is conditional upon the State of Brandenburg, Germany having sufficient funds allocated to this program to pay the reimbursements we claim. In addition, we are required to operate our facility for a minimum of five years and employ a specified number of employees during this period. Our incentive approval expires on December 31, 2009. As of December 30, 2006, we had received $16.8 million under this program and we had accrued an additional $4.0 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date. We are eligible to recover up to approximately 23.8 million ($30.9 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) of expenditures related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany under the German Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen). This Act permits us to claim tax exempt reimbursements for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Tangible assets subsidized under this program have to remain in the region for at least 5 years. In accordance with the administrative requirements of the Act, we plan to claim reimbursement under the Act in conjunction with the filing of our tax returns with the local German tax office. Therefore we do not expect to receive funding from this program until we file our annual tax return for fiscal 2006 in 2007. In addition, this program expired on December 31, 2006 and we can only claim reimbursement for investments completed by this date. The majority of our buildings and structures and our investment in machinery and equipment were completed by this date. As of December 30, 2006, we had accrued $23.5 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date. During July 2006, we entered into a loan agreement, which we amended and restated on August 7, 2006, with the Estate of John T. Walton under which we could draw up to $34.0 million. Interest was payable monthly at the annual rate of the commercial prime lending rate; principal was to be repaid at the earlier of January 2008 or the completion of an initial public offering of our stock. This loan did not have any collateral requirements. As a condition of obtaining this loan, we were required to use a portion of the proceeds to repay the principal of our loan from Kingston Properties, LLC, a related party. During July 2006, we drew $26.0 million against this loan, $8.7 million of which we used to repay the Kingston Properties, LLC loan. Upon completion of our initial public offering in November 2006, we repaid the entire $26.0 million loan balance. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, $14.9 million of which was outstanding at December 30, 2006. Interest is payable monthly at the annual rate of 2.25%; principal payments commenced on December 1, 2006 and end on July 1, 2015. Land and buildings at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $21.6 million at December 30, 2006 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. During the year ended December 25, 2004, we received a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, all of which was outstanding at December 30, 2006. Interest is payable monthly at annual rates starting at 0.25% during the first year the loan is outstanding, increasing to 1.25% during the second and third years, increasing to 2.25% during the fourth and fifth years and increasing to 3.25% for each subsequent year; principal payments commence on January 1, 2007 and end on December 1, 2009. Machinery and equipment at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $9.8 million at December 30, 2006 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. Due to the preparation of our registration statement, we did not meet the non financial covenant to furnish our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the lender within 120 days after our fiscal year end and we 47 Table of Contents received a waiver for that requirement from the lender on June 5, 2006. We have subsequently provided these financial statements to the lender. On May 14, 2003, First Solar Property, LLC issued a $8.7 million promissory note due June 1, 2010 to Kingston Properties, LLC. The interest rate of the note was 3.70% per annum. We pre paid this note in full in July 2006. On February 22, 2006, we received $73.3 million from the issuance of $74.0 million of convertible senior subordinated notes, less $0.7 million of issuance costs, to Goldman, Sachs & Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 30, 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See note 2 to the consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for approximately 95.0% of our net sales in 2006 and 99.6% of our net sales in 2005. In 2006 and 2005, all of our international sales were denominated in euro. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains and losses from the time we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, we recently entered into our Long Term Supply Contracts. These contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. In 2006, a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by $13.1 million. In the past, exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our cash flows by $0.4 million in 2005 and 2006. Although we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we may have increased risk associated with currency fluctuations in the future. As of December 30, 2006, we did not engage in hedging activities; however, our expenditures denominated in euro are increasing due to the construction of our German plant and capital equipment purchases from German suppliers. Most of the German plants operating expenses will be in euro, creating increasing opportunities for some natural hedge against the currency risk in our net sales. In addition, we may decide to enter into other hedging activities in the future. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our end users depend on debt financing to purchase and install a photovoltaic system. Although the useful life of a photovoltaic system is approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the photovoltaic system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our end users rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure and final project. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a photovoltaic system on favorable terms, or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install photovoltaic systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a photovoltaic system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to photovoltaic systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. 48 Table of Contents During July 2006, we entered into the IKB credit facility, which bears interest at Euribor plus 1.6% for the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% for the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% for the revolving credit facility. We entered into three interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable interest on the IKB term loan of Euribor plus 1.6% to fixed interest rates. At December 30, 2006, the notional value of our interest rate swaps were 28.8 million ($37.4 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). Commodity Risk We are exposed to price risks associated with raw material purchases, most significantly tellurium. Currently, we purchase all of our cadmium telluride in manufactured form from two qualified manufacturers, but we plan to qualify additional manufacturers. We have a three year written contract with our qualified supplier, which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium. As other suppliers become qualified, we will purchase cadmium telluride from our other qualified supplier under quarterly purchase orders. In 2006, we entered into a multi year tellurium supply contract in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We acquire the remainder of our raw materials under quarterly or annual purchase orders, at prices based on annual volumes. Because the sale prices of solar modules in our Long Term Supply Contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our supply contracts, we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of our raw materials to our customers. In addition, most of our key raw materials are either sole sourced or sourced by a limited number of third party suppliers. As a result, the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations. If our existing suppliers fail to perform, we will be required to identify and qualify new suppliers, a process that can take between one and twelve months depending on the raw material. We might be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production line in a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms. 49 Table of Contents
