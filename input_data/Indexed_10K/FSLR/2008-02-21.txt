In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements, that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 29 Table of Contents Overview We design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world. Each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. We manufacture our solar modules on high throughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated, proprietary, continuous process. In 2006 and 2007, we sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany. Currently, we manufacture our solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio and Frankfurt/Oder, Germany manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility. We completed the qualification of the first production line at our Perrysburg, Ohio plant for high volume production in November 2004. During 2005, the first full year this production line operated at high volume production, we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to $1.59, from $2.94 in 2004. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to $1.40 in 2006 and to $1.23 in 2007, when we had both plants operating at high volume production. We define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period divided by the total watts produced during the period. By continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt. Our objective is to become, by 2010, the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that generates electricity on a non subsidized basis at a price equal to the price of retail electricity in key markets in North America, Europe and Asia. First Solar was founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research, development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in January 2002. From January 2002 to the end of 2005, we sold approximately 28MW of solar modules. During 2006 and 2007, we sold approximately 56MW and 201MW of solar modules, respectively. On February 22, 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Prior to that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and Fortune 500 companies in the United States. Starting in December 2007, we operate this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of First Solar Electric, LLC. We believe the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC will enable us to develop solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the United States that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million), consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see Note 5). Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2007; all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2006; and all references to fiscal year 2005 relate to the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2005. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity We commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in Perrysburg, Ohio in January 2002. During 2003 and 2004, while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line, we designed and built our first replicable, high throughput production line at the Ohio plant. We ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into this first production line, completing its qualification for full volume production in November 2004. In February 2005, we commenced construction of two additional production lines at our Ohio plant. We completed the qualification of these two additional production lines for full volume production in August 2006. During the construction of these two production lines, we improved certain aspects of our first production line, including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment. Our two line Ohio expansion represents a standard building block 30 Table of Contents for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities. Our Ohio plant currently has an annual manufacturing capacity of 132MW based on the fourth quarter of 2007 average run rate. In February 2006, we commenced construction of our German plant, a new manufacturing facility located in Frankfurt/Oder in the State of Brandenburg that houses four production lines. We completed the qualification of these four additional production lines for full volume production in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, on January 24, 2007 we entered into a land lease agreement for a manufacturing center site in the Kulim Hi Tech Park in the State of Kadah, Malaysia. The Malaysia site can accommodate two four line plants. On November 1, 2007, we exercised an option to lease an adjacent land site that can accommodate an additional two four line plants. As of December 29, 2007, we do not have any more options to lease more land in Malaysia. In April 2007, we began construction of plant one of our Malaysian manufacturing center. In the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we began construction of plants two and three, respectively; and in the first quarter of 2008, we began construction of plant four. We expect plant one to reach its full capacity in the second half of 2008; plant two to reach its full capacity in the first half of 2009; and plants three and four to reach full capacity in the second half of 2009. After plant four of our Malaysian manufacturing center reaches its full capacity, we will have 23 production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1012MW based on the fourth quarter of 2007 run rate at our existing plants. The following table summarizes our current and in process production capacity: Annual Production Date Qualification Number of Capacity of Completed for Production Manufacturing Full Volume Manufacturing Facility Lines Facility(4) Production Ohio plant 3 132MW August 2006 (1) German plant 4 176MW Third quarter of 2007 (2) Malaysia plant I 4 176MW Second half of 2008 (3) Malaysia plant II 4 176MW First half of 2009 (3) Malaysia plant III 4 176MW Second half of 2009 (3) Malaysia plant IV 4 176MW Second half of 2009 (3) Total current and planned 23 1012MW (1) We completed the qualification for full volume production of the first production line at our Ohio plant in November 2004 and the second and third production lines in August 2006.

Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. Net Sales We generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules. Over the past four years, the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce. We price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. For example, during 2007 our average sales price was $2.48 per watt based on a weighted annual average foreign exchange of $1.39/1.00. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts. We currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany, France and Spain, which then resell our solar modules to end users who receive government subsidies. The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currency and subject to the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the euro and U.S. dollar. 31 Table of Contents For example, the strengthening of the euro contributed $43.8 million to our net sales during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in Europe, North America or Asia or if interest rates increase, which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects. In April 2006, we entered into long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European project developers and system integrators, and in 2007, we entered into additional long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects (collectively, the Long Term Supply Contracts). These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2008 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance. Our Long Term Supply Contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately 4.5 billion ($5.9 billion at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) in sales from 2008 to 2012 for the sale of a total of 3.2GW of solar modules. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2006 require us to deliver solar modules each year that, in total, meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year. Under these Long Term Supply Contracts, we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5% annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3% for modules delivered in 2012. If we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year, we will be in breach of the applicable agreements, entitling our customers to certain remedies, potentially including the right to terminate their Long Term Supply Contracts. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2007 do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases 3 4% annually from 2008 to 2010/2011, and then remains fixed through 2012, and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module. All of our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 6.5% at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in 2012. Because the sales prices under our Long Term Supply Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin. The annual 6.5% decline in the sales price under the Long Term Supply Contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 5 6% each year, assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat, and will impact our cash flow accordingly. As a result, our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease. Furthermore, the sales prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts are denominated in euros, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Under our customer contracts, starting in April 2006, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Under our customer contracts in effect prior to April 1, 2006, we did not transfer title or risk of loss, or recognize revenue, until the solar modules were received by our customers. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. Under our Long Term Supply Contracts we have the right to terminate certain Long Term Supply Contracts upon 12 months notice, and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred, including, depending on the contract one or more of the following: new laws, rules or regulations with respect to our production, distribution, installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business; unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread, persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels; or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor, materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput. The average termination fee under those agreements is 3.6 million ($4.7 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). Our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the Long Term Supply Contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the 32 Table of Contents case of a late delivery, certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. The information about our Long Term Supply Contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the Long Term Supply Contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results, including revenues or profitability. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, a small portion of our revenues have been accounted for using the percent of completion method of accounting. Revenues for First Solar Electric, LLC for fiscal December 2007 were $3.7 million and not material to our consolidated results of operations. No single customer accounted for more than 23% of our net sales in 2007. Cost of sales Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components, such as tempered back glass, TCO coated front glass, cadmium telluride, laminate, connector assemblies and laminate edge seal and others. Our total material cost per solar module has been stable over the past three years, even though the cost of tellurium, a component of cadmium telluride, increased by approximately three times from 2003 to 2007. The increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs. Historically, we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials. Starting in 2006, however, we entered into multi year tellurium and CadTel supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase. Other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and end of life collection and recycling expenses to our cost of sales. We implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our collection and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials. In return, the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our collection and recycling program or another program that we approve, and the photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation. We record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per line, geographic diversification into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Gross profit Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines approximately 6.5% at the beginning of each year. Another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached. As a result, gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. 33 Table of Contents Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. We continuously add equipment for further process developments and record the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense. We may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the Ohio expansion to research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes. We maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the United States Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. During the past three years, we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs. We received $0.9 million during each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and $1.8 million during 2007. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Deferred Project Costs Deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials relating to customer contracts. These costs are recognized as deferred assets until installed. Deferred project costs as of December 29, 2007 were $2.6 million. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. We incurred production start up expenses of $11.7 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the qualification of the Ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the German plant. We incurred production start up expenses of $16.9 million during 2007 in connection with the qualification of the German plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. We expect to incur significant production start up expenses in fiscal year 2008 in connection with our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center. In general, we expect production start up expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. Over time, we expect production start up expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Interest income Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 34 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense is incurred on various debt financings. See Description of Certain Indebtedness. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. Income Taxes We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on February 22, 2006. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to federal and state income taxes. Prior to February 22, 2006, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes. As a result, the annual historical financial data included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been, had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year. At December 29, 2007 we had U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $131.3 million, $55.3 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. Our ability to use these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws. Certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions. We expect the tax consequences of our non U.S. subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our non U.S. production capacity. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of December 29, 2007, we had net deferred tax assets of $55.7 million, consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill, property, plant and equipment, economic development funding and share based compensation. During the year ended December 29, 2007, we reversed valuation allowances in the amount of $54.9 million. As of December 30, 2006, we had net deferred tax assets of $54.9 million before valuation allowances, consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill, property, plant and equipment, economic development funding and share based compensation. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are further described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are as follows: Revenue recognition. We sell our products directly to system integrators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. This policy is in accordance with the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB 104, Revision of Topic 13 (Revenue Recognition). Under this policy, we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce 35 Table of Contents inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts. During 2006, we changed the terms of our sales contracts with all of our significant customers to provide that delivery occurs when we deliver our products to the carrier, rather than when the products are received by our customer, as had been our terms under our prior contracts. This change in the terms of our sales contracts resulted in a one time increase to our net sales of $5.4 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. We do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, a portion of our revenues will be derived from long term contracts that we account for under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. (SOP) 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. Accordingly, we will record long term fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition. If we identify any losses on contracts, we will recognize those losses immediately. Contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks, estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Furthermore, contract change orders, claims and similar items, require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. We only include contract change orders, claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable. Incurred costs include all direct material, labor, subcontractor cost, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies and tools. We include job material costs when the job materials have been installed. Where contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation, using the percentage of completion method of accounting. We consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design. As of December 29, 2007, our liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, which is part of the balance sheet caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $2.1 million. This liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts, which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies. We also have a limited number of arrangements that include multiple deliverables. These are contracts under which we both provide design and consulting services for and supply parts and equipment for solar electricity generation systems. We follow the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, when accounting for these arrangements in order to determine whether they have more than one unit of accounting. According to EITF 00 21, deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer, if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available, and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items. We determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar electricity generation system parts and equipment. We apply the same revenue recognition principles (from SAB 104) as we use for our arrangements for the stand alone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with SOP 81 1. End of life collection and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives. We base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation site to a recycling center and the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk rate for such services. We based this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. In the periods between the time of 36 Table of Contents our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement. We charged $2.5 million and $8.9 million to cost of sales for the fair value of our collection and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 and December 29, 2007, respectively. During the year ended December 30, 2006 the accretion expense on our collection and recycling obligations was insignificant, and during the year ended December 29, 2007 the accretion expense was $0.3 million. An increase of 10% or a decrease of 10% in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling each solar module would result in a 10% increase or decrease, respectively, in our annual collection and recycling cost accrual; a 10% increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a 9% decrease in our estimated costs; and a 10% decrease in the rate would result in a 10% increase in the cost. Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty to the owner of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions. We also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating within the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating within the following 15 years. Our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by $1.0 million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006 and December 29, 2007, this estimate did not require further significant adjustments. Share based compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards, and we adopted SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 using the modified retrospective method of transition. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 107, which provides guidance regarding the implementation of SFAS 123(R). In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in share based compensation valuation models, the classification of share based compensation expense, the capitalization of share based compensation costs and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis in filings with the SEC. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes Merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options, which is consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes Merton formula, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return. Because our stock has only recently become publicly traded, we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility; therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price. We estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding. If we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future share based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards, even if the critical terms of the awards are similar. Higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which we expect to vest. Quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation. Increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters. Decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the 37 Table of Contents quarter of the change and future quarters. These adjustments affect our cost of sales, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative and production start up expenses. The adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest reduced our share based compensation expense by $0.6 million in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 and increased our share based compensation expense by $2.9 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007. Adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of share based awards that we expect to vest. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. Our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities. Our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules. We account for our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result, we assess long lived assets classified as held and used (including our property, plant and equipment) for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. We evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during 2007 and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations. Determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events, including the following: the amount, timing and character of deductions; permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law; and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions, or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets, liabilities, expenses and benefits that we record during any given period. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the future periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible. We determine the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109, which require us to weigh both positive and negative evidence in order to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized. We evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of cumulative net losses, benefits that could be realized from available tax strategies and forecasts of future taxable income, in determining the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Certain Effects of the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC. The Turner Renewable Energy, LLC (TRE) acquisition is being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. Under the purchase method of accounting, TREs results of operations and the impact of the completion of the acquisition will be reflected in our financial statements on a prospective basis. Fiscal December 2007 financial results for First Solar Electric, LLC (formerly Turner Renewable Energy, LLC) were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We do not amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and, if necessary, would record any impairment in accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We will perform the first annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 or earlier if facts and circumstances warrant a review. In the process of our annual 38 Table of Contents impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. Marketable Securities. We have classified our marketable securities as available for sale. Such marketable securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings, computed using the specific identification cost method. All of our available for sale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. We consider our marketable debt securities impaired, when a significant decline in the issuers credit quality is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Investments identified as being impaired are subject to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005: Years Ended December 29, December 30, December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 50.1 % 59.8 % 65.5 % Gross profit 49.9 % 40.2 % 34.5 % Research and development 3.0 % 4.7 % 5.0 % Selling, general and administrative 16.4 % 24.7 % 32.9 % Production start up 3.3 % 8.7 % 6.6 % Operating income (loss) 27.2 % 2.1 % (10.0 )% Foreign currency gain (loss) 0.4 % 4.1 % (3.6 )% Interest income 4.1 % 2.0 % 0.7 % Interest expense, net (0.5 )% (0.8 )% (0.9 )% Other (expense) income (0.3 )% (0.6 )% 0.2 % Income tax benefit (expense) 0.5 % (3.9 )% Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation 0.2 % Net income (loss) 31.4 % 2.9 % (13.4 )% Fiscal Years Ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 503,976 $ 134,974 $ 369,002 273 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 259% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2007 compared to 2006. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of the production ramp at our German plant, the full production of our Ohio expansion and continued improvements to our overall process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 11% in 2007 compared with 2006. Our average selling price in 2007 increased to $2.48 from $2.39 in 2006. Our average selling price was positively impacted by $0.21 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and partially offset by a price decline of $0.12. Approximately 91% of our net sales in 2007 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. 39 Table of Contents Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 252,573 $ 80,730 $ 171,843 213 % % of net sales 50.1 % 59.8 % Direct material expense increased by $87.3 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased by $9.1 million, sales freight and other costs increased by $3.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes in 2007 compared with 2006. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $72.2 million, which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $43.0 million, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $4.2 million in 2006 to $9.5 million in 2007, resulting from the infrastructure associated with our Ohio expansion and German plant build out, facility and related expenses of $16.0 million and depreciation expense of $13.2 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio and German plants. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 251,403 $ 54,244 $ 197,159 363 % Gross margin% 49.9 % 40.2 % Gross profit increased by $197.2 million, or 363%, from $54.2 million in 2006 to $251.4 million in 2007, reflecting an increase in net sales. As a percentage of sales, gross margin increased 9.7 percentage points from 40.2% in 2006 to 49.9% 2007, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our plant expansions, which drove a 259% increase in the number of megawatts sold. Additionally, we incurred $7.6 million of costs, or 1.5% of revenues, associated with the ramp of our German plant in 2007, compared with $1.1 million of costs, or 0.8% of revenues, incurred in 2006 related to the ramp of our Ohio expansion. For fiscal 2007 foreign exchange gains contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our gross margin, offsetting the majority of our annual contractual price decline. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 15,107 $ 6,361 $ 8,746 137 % % of net sales 3.0 % 4.7 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $7.9 million increase in personnel related expense, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $2.3 million in 2006 to $4.7 million in 2007, due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $1.7 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 82,248 $ 33,348 $ 48,900 147 % % of net sales 16.4 % 24.7 % 40 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $36.1 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in share based compensation from $5.3 million in 2006 to $23.4 million in 2007. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $11.3 million and other expenses increased by $1.5 million during 2007, primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company and infrastructure build out to support our growth. Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 16,867 $ 11,725 $ 5,142 44 % % of net sales 3.3 % 8.7 % In 2007, we incurred $16.9 million of production start up expenses related to our German and Malaysia expansions, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $11.7 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and German plant expansions during 2006. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Foreign exchange gain Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain $ 1,881 $ 5,544 $ (3,663 ) N.M. Foreign exchange gain decreased by $3.7 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of hedging the foreign exchange exposure in 2007 to mitigate some of the impact on the fluctuating dollar. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 20,413 $ 2,648 $ 17,765 N.M. The increase in interest income of $17.8 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances throughout 2007. We completed an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of $302.7 million and an equity follow on public offering in the third quarter of 2007, which provided us with net proceeds of $366.0 million. We also had higher investments in 2007 compared to 2006 that generated interest at higher rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 2,294 $ 1,023 $ 1,271 124 % Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased by $1.3 million or 124%, from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2007, we capitalized $3.8 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $3.3 million in 2006. 41 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other expense $ 1,219 $ 799 $ 420 N.M. The increase in other expense of $0.4 million was primarily due to increased financing fees related to the IKB loans. Income tax benefit (expense) Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax benefit (expense) $ 2,392 $ (5,206 ) $ 7,598 N.M. Our 2007 annual income tax benefit was $2.4 million. The 2007 tax rate was a benefit of 1.5% which primarily reflects the net of a tax rate of 33.7% and a rate benefit of 35.2% due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $54.9 million. The reversal was based upon our updated assessment of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets. The available positive evidence during fiscal 2007 included cumulative taxable income for the previous twelve quarters and a projection of future taxable income. The income tax expense for 2006 was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation, profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Fiscal Years Ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 134,974 $ 48,063 $ 86,911 181 % Net sales increased by $86.9 million, or 181%, from $48.1 million in 2005 to $135.0 million in 2006. The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 184% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2006 compared to 2005. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of higher throughput, our conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the full production ramp of our Ohio expansion. Net sales in 2006 also benefited from a change in our shipping terms from delivered duty paid to carriage and insurance paid, which became effective in the second quarter of 2006. This change affected revenue recognition by $5.4 million of in transit inventory during the first half of 2006. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 59 watts in 2005 to approximately 63 watts in 2006. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per watt from $2.43 in 2005 to $2.39 in 2006. Our average selling price was positively impacted by $0.05 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and euro. Strong demand from other customers allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 45% of net sales in 2005 to 19% of net sales in 2006. In both periods, almost all of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 80,730 $ 31,483 $ 49,247 156 % % of net sales 59.8 % 65.5 % Cost of sales increased by $49.2 million, or 156%, from $31.5 million in 2005 to $80.7 million in 2006. Direct material expense increased $21.6 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased $3.7 million, direct labor expense increased $3.9 million and sales freight and other 42 Table of Contents costs increased $1.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes during 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $18.9 million, which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $8.7 million, including a $3.3 million increase in share based compensation expense, resulting from the conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the overall infrastructure build out of our Ohio expansion, an increase in facility related expenses of $4.3 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.9 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio expansion. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 54,244 $ 16,580 $ 37,664 227 % Gross margin% 40.2 % 34.5 % Gross profit increased by $37.7 million, or 227%, from $16.6 million in 2005 to $54.2 million in 2006, reflecting an increase in net sales. As a percentage of sales, gross margin increased from 34.5% in 2005 to 40.2% in 2006, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with the expansion of our Ohio plant, which drove a 184% increase in the number of MW sold. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 6,361 $ 2,372 $ 3,989 168 % % of net sales 4.7 % 5.0 % Research and development expense increased by $4.0 million, or 168%, from $2.4 million in 2005 to $6.4 million in 2006. The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $3.2 million increase in personnel related expense, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $0.6 million in 2005 to $2.3 million in 2006, due to increased headcount and additional option awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $0.7 million and grant revenue declined by $0.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 33,348 $ 15,825 $ 17,523 111 % % of net sales 24.7 % 32.9 % Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $17.5 million, or 111%, from $15.8 million in 2005 to $33.3 million in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $12.0 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in share based compensation from $3.4 million in 2005 to $5.3 million in 2006. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $4.8 million and other expenses increased by $0.7 million during 2006, primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company. 43 Table of Contents Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 11,725 $ 3,173 $ 8,552 270 % % of net sales 8.7 % 6.6 % In 2006, we incurred $11.7 million of production start up expenses to qualify our Ohio expansion and ramp our German plant, including related legal and regulatory costs and increased headcount, compared to $3.2 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio expansion during 2005. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses and management of our replication process. Foreign exchange gain (loss) Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain (loss) $ 5,544 $ (1,715 ) $ 7,259 N.M. Foreign exchange gain increased by $7.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of favorable currency translation between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 2,648 $ 316 $ 2,332 N.M. The increase in interest income of $2.3 million was primarily due to higher cash balances as a result of our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $302.7 million. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 1,023 $ 418 $ 605 N.M. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased by $0.6 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2006, we capitalized $3.3 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $0.4 million in 2005. Other (expense) income Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other (expense) income $ (799 ) $ 56 $ (855 ) N.M. The increase in other expense of $0.9 million was primarily due to increased financing fees. Income tax expense Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax expense $ 5,206 $ $ 5,206 N.M. 44 Table of Contents The increase in income tax expense was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation, profitability in 2006, and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cumulative effect $ $ 89 $ (89 ) N.M. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) required a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options resulting in a one time cumulative effect of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, borrowings from JWMA Partners, LLC (JWMA) and its affiliates, borrowings from Goldman, Sachs Co., equity contributions from JWMA and borrowings from local governments, capital markets and other sources to fund plant expansions. During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock. During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007, we received $366.0 million in net proceeds from a follow on offering of our common stock. As of December 29, 2007, we had $669.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $308.4 million as of December 30, 2006. One of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines, such as the recently completed German plant and the plants currently under construction at our Malaysia manufacturing center. We expect that each four line manufacturing plant that we are building in Malaysia will require a capital expenditure of approximately $170.0 million to complete. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, government grants and low interest debt financings for our German plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our expansion strategy. We may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future, which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. See Item 1A: Risk Factors Our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner, both of which are subject risks and uncertainties. We spent $70.1 million in capital expenditures for the Ohio expansion through 2006. In addition, we spent approximately $150.0 million for the build out of our German plant through 2007. We expect to spend approximately $170.0 million to build each of the four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. We spent $229.0 million toward the build out of each of these plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center in 2007 and we expect to spend approximately $377.0 million in 2008 and an additional $74.0 million in 2009. A majority of our capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009 will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Cash Flows Cash provided (used) was as follows for the twelve months ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Operating activities $ 205,951 $ (576 ) $ 5,040 Investing activities (547,250 ) (159,994 ) (43,832 ) Financing activities 430,421 451,550 51,663 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows 7,050 391 385 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 96,172 $ 291,371 $ 13,256 45 Table of Contents Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $206.0 million during 2007 compared to cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million during 2006. Cash provided by interest receivable increased to $20.0 million during 2007 from $2.6 million during 2006 mainly due to the increased cash from the initial public offering and the follow on offering. Cash received from customers increased to $516.0 million during 2007 from $110.2 million during 2006 mainly due to an increase in net sales and shorter payment terms. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and associates of $276.5 million compared to cash paid to suppliers and employees of $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in raw materials, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion and by an increase in cash paid for income taxes of $19.0 million during 2007. Cash used in operating activities was $0.6 million during 2006 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 million during 2005. During 2006, cash received from customers increased by $60.6 million to $110.2 million, mainly due to increased accounts receivable resulting from higher revenues. This increase was offset by cash paid to suppliers and associates of $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in inventories to support revenue growth and other costs supporting our global expansion. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $547.3 million during 2007 compared with $160.0 million during 2006. Cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from capital expenditures of $242.4 million during 2007 and $153.2 million during 2006 and the net purchase of marketable securities of $293.4 million during 2007. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to our investments related to the construction of our new plants in Germany and Malaysia. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $9.5 million and $16.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash paid for the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, net of cash acquired was $5.5 million. Cash used in investing activities was $160.0 million during 2006 compared to $43.8 million during 2005. Cash used for investing activities during 2006 was composed of $153.2 million in capital expenditures for our German plant and the Ohio expansion and $6.8 million in cash placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program, to secure our construction loan for the German plant and to secure an inventory supply contract. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash used in investing activities during 2005 was mainly composed of $42.5 million in capital expenditures for our Ohio expansion and $1.3 million placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $430.4 million during 2007 compared with $451.6 million during 2006. During 2007 we received $366.0 million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $49.4 million from additional draws under debt facilities. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $10.2 million. Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options during 2007 were $30.2 million. In addition, we received $9.5 million in economic development funding from various German governmental entities related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany. These receipts were partially offset by $34.8 million in net repayments of long term debt. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions by JWMA of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts was the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. 46 Table of Contents On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities in the United States. Starting in December 2007, we operated this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of First Solar Electric, LLC. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million), consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see note 5). Cash provided by financing activities was $451.6 million during 2006 compared to $51.7 million during 2005. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions by JWMA of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts was the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. During 2005, cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of a $20.0 million loan from a related party, a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio and a $16.7 million cash equity contribution by JWMA. On October 24, 2006, we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 and up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.001. These amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers, preferences, and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue. On October 30, 2006, our board of directors approved a 4.85 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares, which was effective November 1, 2006; the par value of our common shares remained $0.001 per share, and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2007, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements.

Debt and Credit Sources On July 27, 2006, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Solar, Inc., entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG under which we can draw up to 102.0 million ($149.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) to fund costs of constructing and starting up our German plant. This credit facility consists of a term loan of up to 53.0 million ($77.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) and a revolving credit facility of 27.0 million ($39.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00). The facility also provides for a bridge loan, which we can draw against to fund construction costs that we later expect to be reimbursed through funding from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen), of up to 22.0 million ($32.3 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00). We can make drawdowns against the term loan and the bridge loan until December 30, 2007 and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until September 30, 2012. We have incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling $2.2 million as of December 29, 2007, which we will recognize as interest and other financing expenses over the time that borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility. We also pay an annual commitment fee of 0.6% of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility. At December 29, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings of $67.8 million under the term loan, which we classify as long term debt, and $24.5 million under the bridge loan, which we classify as short term debt. We had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 29, 2007. We must repay the term loan in eighteen quarterly payments beginning on March 31, 2008 and ending on June 29, 2012. We must repay the bridge loan with any funding we receive from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005, but in any event, the bridge loan must be paid in full by December 30, 2008. Once repaid, we may not draw against the term loan or bridge loan facilities. The revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by December 30, 2012. In certain circumstances, we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments, and during 2009, we will also be required to make a one time principal repayment equal to 20% of any surplus cash flow of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH during 2008. Surplus cash flow is a term defined in the credit facility agreement that is approximately equal to cash flow from operating activities less required payments on indebtedness. We pay interest at the annual rate of the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) plus 1.6% on the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% on the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% on the revolving credit facility. Each time we make a draw against the term loan or the bridge loan, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every three or six months; each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one, three or six months. The credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps covering at least 75% of the balance outstanding under the term loan. The Federal Republic of Germany is guaranteeing 48% of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the State of Brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32%. We pay an annual fee, not to exceed 0.5 million ($0.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) for these guarantees. In addition, we must maintain a debt service reserve of 3.0 million ($4.4 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) in a restricted bank account, which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility. Substantially all of our assets in Germany, including the German plant, have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees. The credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flow available for debt service must be at least 1.1 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may not exceed 3.0:1 from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008, 2.5:1 from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 and 1.5:1 from January 1, 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility. 48 Table of Contents The credit facility also contains various non financial covenants with which we must comply. We must submit various financial reports, financial calculations and statistics, operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender. We must adequately insure our German operation and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems. Also, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH cannot open any bank accounts (other than those required by the credit facility), enter into any financial liabilities (other than intercompany obligations, those liabilities required by the credit facility or permitted encumbrances), sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business, make any loans or guarantees to third parties, or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors. Our ability to withdraw cash from First Solar Manufacturing GmbH for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flows from operations must generally be used for the payment of loan interest, fees and principal before any remainder can be used to pay intercompany charges, loans or dividends. Furthermore, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 1.3 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30% of the amount of its total assets. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2% to First Solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products. Also, we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, such as if project related costs exceed our plan, we do not recover the expected amounts from governmental investment subsidies or all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn. If there is a decline in the value of the assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility, we may also be required to pledge additional assets as collateral. On July 26, 2006, we were approved to receive taxable investment incentives (Investitionszuschsse) of approximately 21.5 million ($31.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) from the State of Brandenburg, Germany. These funds will reimburse us for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Receipt of these incentives is conditional upon the State of Brandenburg, Germany having sufficient funds allocated to this program to pay the reimbursements we claim. In addition, we are required to operate our facility for a minimum of five years and employ a specified number of associates during this period. Our incentive approval expires on December 31, 2009. As of December 29, 2007, we had received $29.5 million under this program and we had accrued an additional $1.4 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date. We are eligible to recover up to approximately 23.8 million ($35.0 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) of expenditures related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany under the German Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen). This Act permits us to claim tax exempt reimbursements for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Tangible assets subsidized under this program have to remain in the region for at least five years. In accordance with the administrative requirements of this Act, we claimed reimbursement under the Act in conjunction with the filing of our tax returns with the local German tax office during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, this program expired on December 31, 2006 and we can only claim reimbursement for investments completed by this date. The majority of our buildings and structures and our investment in machinery and equipment were completed by this date. As of December 29, 2007, we had accrued $34.4 million eligible to be received under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through the expiration date. During July 2006, we entered into a loan agreement, which we amended and restated on August 7, 2006, with the Estate of John T. Walton under which we could draw up to $34.0 million. Interest was payable monthly at the annual rate of the commercial prime lending rate; principal was to be repaid at the earlier of January 2008 or the completion of an initial public offering of our stock. This loan did not have any collateral requirements. As a condition of obtaining this loan, we were required to use a portion of the proceeds to repay the principal of our loan from Kingston Properties, LLC, a related party. During July 2006, we drew $26.0 million against this loan, 49 Table of Contents $8.7 million of which we used to repay the Kingston Properties, LLC loan. Upon completion of our initial public offering in November 2006, we repaid the entire $26.0 million loan balance. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, $13.2 million of which was outstanding at December 29, 2007. Interest is payable monthly at the annual rate of 2.25%; principal payments commenced on December 1, 2006 and end on July 1, 2015. Land and buildings at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $21.1 million at December 29, 2007 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. During the year ended December 25, 2004, we received a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, of which $3.3 million was outstanding at December 29, 2007. Interest is payable monthly at annual rates starting at 0.25% during the first year the loan is outstanding, increasing to 1.25% during the second and third years, 2.25% during the fourth and fifth years and increasing to 3.25% for each subsequent year; principal payments commenced on January 1, 2007 and end on December 1, 2009. Machinery and equipment at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $7.7 million at December 29, 2007 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. On May 14, 2003, First Solar Property, LLC issued an $8.7 million promissory note due June 1, 2010 to Kingston Properties, LLC. The interest rate of the note was 3.70% per annum. We repaid this note in full in July 2006. On February 22, 2006, we received $73.3 million from the issuance of $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes, less $0.7 million of issuance costs, to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 29, 2007. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for approximately 98.8% of our net sales in 2007 and 95.0% of our net sales in 2006; all of which were denominated in euros. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. Historically, most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. In 2007, a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by $50.4 million. With the expansion of our manufacturing operations into Germany and the current expansion into Malaysia, our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, cash flow and translation: Transaction Exposure: We have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable (including inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables, investments and payables recognized in earnings. 50 Table of Contents As of December 29, 2007, we had a single outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contract with a notional value equivalent to 20.0 million ($26.8 million at a fixed exchange rate of $1.34/1.00), maturing in February 2009, to hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure. Cash Flow Exposure: We have forecasted future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. We initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified this into earnings when the transaction is settled. The notional amount of our cash flow hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment was 112.8 million ($165.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) and the losses, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2007 were $3.2 million. Earnings Translation Exposure: Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the impact of currency fluctuations. Such contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income, net. We do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our end users depend on debt financing to purchase and install a solar electricity generation system. Although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our end users rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure and final project. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar electricity generation systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar electricity generation systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. During July 2006, we entered into the IKB credit facility, which bears interest at Euribor plus 1.6% for the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% for the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% for the revolving credit facility. As of December 29, 2007, we hedged our exposure to changes in Euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of 46.0 million ($67.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00). In addition, we invest some of our cash in debt securities, which exposes us to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including money market funds, government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit. As of December 29, 2007, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 5.4%, with a weighted average maturity of three months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 51 Table of Contents 100 basis points, the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $1.6 million. Commodity Risk We are exposed to price risks associated with raw material and component purchases, most significantly tellurium. Presently, we purchase most of our cadmium telluride in compounded form from a limited number of qualified suppliers. We have a long term contract with one of our qualified cadmium telluride suppliers, which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium. Commencing in 2006, we entered into multi year tellurium supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We purchase from our other qualified supplier on a purchase order basis. Because the sale prices of solar modules in our Long Term Supply Contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw materials and component supply contracts, we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of our raw materials or components to many of our customers. In addition, most of our key raw materials and components are either sole sourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers. As a result, the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations. If our existing suppliers fail to perform, we will be required to identify and qualify new suppliers, a process that can take up to 12 months depending on the raw material or component. We might be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production line on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms. 52 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements, that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 29 Table of Contents Overview We design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world. Each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. We manufacture our solar modules on high throughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated, proprietary, continuous process. In 2006 and 2007, we sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany. Currently, we manufacture our solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio and Frankfurt/Oder, Germany manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility. We completed the qualification of the first production line at our Perrysburg, Ohio plant for high volume production in November 2004. During 2005, the first full year this production line operated at high volume production, we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to $1.59, from $2.94 in 2004. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to $1.40 in 2006 and to $1.23 in 2007, when we had both plants operating at high volume production. We define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period divided by the total watts produced during the period. By continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt. Our objective is to become, by 2010, the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that generates electricity on a non subsidized basis at a price equal to the price of retail electricity in key markets in North America, Europe and Asia. First Solar was founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research, development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in January 2002. From January 2002 to the end of 2005, we sold approximately 28MW of solar modules. During 2006 and 2007, we sold approximately 56MW and 201MW of solar modules, respectively. On February 22, 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Prior to that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and Fortune 500 companies in the United States. Starting in December 2007, we operate this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of First Solar Electric, LLC. We believe the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC will enable us to develop solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the United States that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million), consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see Note 5). Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2007; all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2006; and all references to fiscal year 2005 relate to the 53 weeks ended December 31, 2005. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity We commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in Perrysburg, Ohio in January 2002. During 2003 and 2004, while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line, we designed and built our first replicable, high throughput production line at the Ohio plant. We ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into this first production line, completing its qualification for full volume production in November 2004. In February 2005, we commenced construction of two additional production lines at our Ohio plant. We completed the qualification of these two additional production lines for full volume production in August 2006. During the construction of these two production lines, we improved certain aspects of our first production line, including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment. Our two line Ohio expansion represents a standard building block 30 Table of Contents for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities. Our Ohio plant currently has an annual manufacturing capacity of 132MW based on the fourth quarter of 2007 average run rate. In February 2006, we commenced construction of our German plant, a new manufacturing facility located in Frankfurt/Oder in the State of Brandenburg that houses four production lines. We completed the qualification of these four additional production lines for full volume production in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, on January 24, 2007 we entered into a land lease agreement for a manufacturing center site in the Kulim Hi Tech Park in the State of Kadah, Malaysia. The Malaysia site can accommodate two four line plants. On November 1, 2007, we exercised an option to lease an adjacent land site that can accommodate an additional two four line plants. As of December 29, 2007, we do not have any more options to lease more land in Malaysia. In April 2007, we began construction of plant one of our Malaysian manufacturing center. In the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we began construction of plants two and three, respectively; and in the first quarter of 2008, we began construction of plant four. We expect plant one to reach its full capacity in the second half of 2008; plant two to reach its full capacity in the first half of 2009; and plants three and four to reach full capacity in the second half of 2009. After plant four of our Malaysian manufacturing center reaches its full capacity, we will have 23 production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1012MW based on the fourth quarter of 2007 run rate at our existing plants. The following table summarizes our current and in process production capacity: Annual Production Date Qualification Number of Capacity of Completed for Production Manufacturing Full Volume Manufacturing Facility Lines Facility(4) Production Ohio plant 3 132MW August 2006 (1) German plant 4 176MW Third quarter of 2007 (2) Malaysia plant I 4 176MW Second half of 2008 (3) Malaysia plant II 4 176MW First half of 2009 (3) Malaysia plant III 4 176MW Second half of 2009 (3) Malaysia plant IV 4 176MW Second half of 2009 (3) Total current and planned 23 1012MW (1) We completed the qualification for full volume production of the first production line at our Ohio plant in November 2004 and the second and third production lines in August 2006.

Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. Net Sales We generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules. Over the past four years, the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce. We price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. For example, during 2007 our average sales price was $2.48 per watt based on a weighted annual average foreign exchange of $1.39/1.00. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts. We currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in Germany, France and Spain, which then resell our solar modules to end users who receive government subsidies. The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currency and subject to the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the euro and U.S. dollar. 31 Table of Contents For example, the strengthening of the euro contributed $43.8 million to our net sales during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in Europe, North America or Asia or if interest rates increase, which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects. In April 2006, we entered into long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European project developers and system integrators, and in 2007, we entered into additional long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects (collectively, the Long Term Supply Contracts). These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2008 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance. Our Long Term Supply Contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately 4.5 billion ($5.9 billion at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00) in sales from 2008 to 2012 for the sale of a total of 3.2GW of solar modules. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2006 require us to deliver solar modules each year that, in total, meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year. Under these Long Term Supply Contracts, we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5% annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3% for modules delivered in 2012. If we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year, we will be in breach of the applicable agreements, entitling our customers to certain remedies, potentially including the right to terminate their Long Term Supply Contracts. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2007 do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases 3 4% annually from 2008 to 2010/2011, and then remains fixed through 2012, and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module. All of our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 6.5% at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in 2012. Because the sales prices under our Long Term Supply Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin. The annual 6.5% decline in the sales price under the Long Term Supply Contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 5 6% each year, assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat, and will impact our cash flow accordingly. As a result, our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease. Furthermore, the sales prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts are denominated in euros, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Under our customer contracts, starting in April 2006, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Under our customer contracts in effect prior to April 1, 2006, we did not transfer title or risk of loss, or recognize revenue, until the solar modules were received by our customers. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. Under our Long Term Supply Contracts we have the right to terminate certain Long Term Supply Contracts upon 12 months notice, and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred, including, depending on the contract one or more of the following: new laws, rules or regulations with respect to our production, distribution, installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business; unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread, persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels; or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor, materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput. The average termination fee under those agreements is 3.6 million ($4.7 million at an assumed exchange rate of $1.30/1.00). Our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the Long Term Supply Contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the 32 Table of Contents case of a late delivery, certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. The information about our Long Term Supply Contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the Long Term Supply Contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results, including revenues or profitability. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, a small portion of our revenues have been accounted for using the percent of completion method of accounting. Revenues for First Solar Electric, LLC for fiscal December 2007 were $3.7 million and not material to our consolidated results of operations. No single customer accounted for more than 23% of our net sales in 2007. Cost of sales Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components, such as tempered back glass, TCO coated front glass, cadmium telluride, laminate, connector assemblies and laminate edge seal and others. Our total material cost per solar module has been stable over the past three years, even though the cost of tellurium, a component of cadmium telluride, increased by approximately three times from 2003 to 2007. The increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs. Historically, we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials. Starting in 2006, however, we entered into multi year tellurium and CadTel supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase. Other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and end of life collection and recycling expenses to our cost of sales. We implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our collection and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials. In return, the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our collection and recycling program or another program that we approve, and the photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation. We record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per line, geographic diversification into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Gross profit Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines approximately 6.5% at the beginning of each year. Another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached. As a result, gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. 33 Table of Contents Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. We continuously add equipment for further process developments and record the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense. We may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the Ohio expansion to research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes. We maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the United States Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. During the past three years, we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs. We received $0.9 million during each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and $1.8 million during 2007. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Deferred Project Costs Deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials relating to customer contracts. These costs are recognized as deferred assets until installed. Deferred project costs as of December 29, 2007 were $2.6 million. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. We incurred production start up expenses of $11.7 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the qualification of the Ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the German plant. We incurred production start up expenses of $16.9 million during 2007 in connection with the qualification of the German plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. We expect to incur significant production start up expenses in fiscal year 2008 in connection with our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center. In general, we expect production start up expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. Over time, we expect production start up expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Interest income Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 34 Table of Contents Interest expense Interest expense is incurred on various debt financings. See Description of Certain Indebtedness. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. dollar. Income Taxes We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on February 22, 2006. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to federal and state income taxes. Prior to February 22, 2006, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes. As a result, the annual historical financial data included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been, had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year. At December 29, 2007 we had U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $131.3 million, $55.3 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. Our ability to use these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws. Certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions. We expect the tax consequences of our non U.S. subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our non U.S. production capacity. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of December 29, 2007, we had net deferred tax assets of $55.7 million, consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill, property, plant and equipment, economic development funding and share based compensation. During the year ended December 29, 2007, we reversed valuation allowances in the amount of $54.9 million. As of December 30, 2006, we had net deferred tax assets of $54.9 million before valuation allowances, consisting primarily of tax basis goodwill, property, plant and equipment, economic development funding and share based compensation. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are further described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are as follows: Revenue recognition. We sell our products directly to system integrators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. This policy is in accordance with the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB 104, Revision of Topic 13 (Revenue Recognition). Under this policy, we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce 35 Table of Contents inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts. During 2006, we changed the terms of our sales contracts with all of our significant customers to provide that delivery occurs when we deliver our products to the carrier, rather than when the products are received by our customer, as had been our terms under our prior contracts. This change in the terms of our sales contracts resulted in a one time increase to our net sales of $5.4 million during the year ended December 30, 2006. We do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, a portion of our revenues will be derived from long term contracts that we account for under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. (SOP) 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. Accordingly, we will record long term fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition. If we identify any losses on contracts, we will recognize those losses immediately. Contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks, estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Furthermore, contract change orders, claims and similar items, require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. We only include contract change orders, claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable. Incurred costs include all direct material, labor, subcontractor cost, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies and tools. We include job material costs when the job materials have been installed. Where contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation, using the percentage of completion method of accounting. We consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design. As of December 29, 2007, our liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, which is part of the balance sheet caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $2.1 million. This liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts, which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies. We also have a limited number of arrangements that include multiple deliverables. These are contracts under which we both provide design and consulting services for and supply parts and equipment for solar electricity generation systems. We follow the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, when accounting for these arrangements in order to determine whether they have more than one unit of accounting. According to EITF 00 21, deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer, if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available, and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items. We determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar electricity generation system parts and equipment. We apply the same revenue recognition principles (from SAB 104) as we use for our arrangements for the stand alone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with SOP 81 1. End of life collection and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives. We base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation site to a recycling center and the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk rate for such services. We based this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. In the periods between the time of 36 Table of Contents our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement. We charged $2.5 million and $8.9 million to cost of sales for the fair value of our collection and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 and December 29, 2007, respectively. During the year ended December 30, 2006 the accretion expense on our collection and recycling obligations was insignificant, and during the year ended December 29, 2007 the accretion expense was $0.3 million. An increase of 10% or a decrease of 10% in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling each solar module would result in a 10% increase or decrease, respectively, in our annual collection and recycling cost accrual; a 10% increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a 9% decrease in our estimated costs; and a 10% decrease in the rate would result in a 10% increase in the cost. Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty to the owner of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions. We also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating within the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating within the following 15 years. Our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by $1.0 million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006 and December 29, 2007, this estimate did not require further significant adjustments. Share based compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards, and we adopted SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 using the modified retrospective method of transition. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 107, which provides guidance regarding the implementation of SFAS 123(R). In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in share based compensation valuation models, the classification of share based compensation expense, the capitalization of share based compensation costs and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis in filings with the SEC. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes Merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options, which is consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes Merton formula, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return. Because our stock has only recently become publicly traded, we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility; therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price. We estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding. If we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future share based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards, even if the critical terms of the awards are similar. Higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which we expect to vest. Quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation. Increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters. Decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the 37 Table of Contents quarter of the change and future quarters. These adjustments affect our cost of sales, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative and production start up expenses. The adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest reduced our share based compensation expense by $0.6 million in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 and increased our share based compensation expense by $2.9 million in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007. Adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of share based awards that we expect to vest. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. Our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities. Our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules. We account for our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result, we assess long lived assets classified as held and used (including our property, plant and equipment) for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. We evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during 2007 and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of U.S. and non U.S. tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases, including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations. Determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events, including the following: the amount, timing and character of deductions; permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law; and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions, or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets, liabilities, expenses and benefits that we record during any given period. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the future periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible. We determine the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109, which require us to weigh both positive and negative evidence in order to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized. We evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of cumulative net losses, benefits that could be realized from available tax strategies and forecasts of future taxable income, in determining the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Certain Effects of the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC. The Turner Renewable Energy, LLC (TRE) acquisition is being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. Under the purchase method of accounting, TREs results of operations and the impact of the completion of the acquisition will be reflected in our financial statements on a prospective basis. Fiscal December 2007 financial results for First Solar Electric, LLC (formerly Turner Renewable Energy, LLC) were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We do not amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and, if necessary, would record any impairment in accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We will perform the first annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 or earlier if facts and circumstances warrant a review. In the process of our annual 38 Table of Contents impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. Marketable Securities. We have classified our marketable securities as available for sale. Such marketable securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings, computed using the specific identification cost method. All of our available for sale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. We consider our marketable debt securities impaired, when a significant decline in the issuers credit quality is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Investments identified as being impaired are subject to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005: Years Ended December 29, December 30, December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 50.1 % 59.8 % 65.5 % Gross profit 49.9 % 40.2 % 34.5 % Research and development 3.0 % 4.7 % 5.0 % Selling, general and administrative 16.4 % 24.7 % 32.9 % Production start up 3.3 % 8.7 % 6.6 % Operating income (loss) 27.2 % 2.1 % (10.0 )% Foreign currency gain (loss) 0.4 % 4.1 % (3.6 )% Interest income 4.1 % 2.0 % 0.7 % Interest expense, net (0.5 )% (0.8 )% (0.9 )% Other (expense) income (0.3 )% (0.6 )% 0.2 % Income tax benefit (expense) 0.5 % (3.9 )% Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation 0.2 % Net income (loss) 31.4 % 2.9 % (13.4 )% Fiscal Years Ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 503,976 $ 134,974 $ 369,002 273 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 259% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2007 compared to 2006. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of the production ramp at our German plant, the full production of our Ohio expansion and continued improvements to our overall process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 11% in 2007 compared with 2006. Our average selling price in 2007 increased to $2.48 from $2.39 in 2006. Our average selling price was positively impacted by $0.21 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and partially offset by a price decline of $0.12. Approximately 91% of our net sales in 2007 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. 39 Table of Contents Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 252,573 $ 80,730 $ 171,843 213 % % of net sales 50.1 % 59.8 % Direct material expense increased by $87.3 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased by $9.1 million, sales freight and other costs increased by $3.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes in 2007 compared with 2006. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $72.2 million, which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $43.0 million, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $4.2 million in 2006 to $9.5 million in 2007, resulting from the infrastructure associated with our Ohio expansion and German plant build out, facility and related expenses of $16.0 million and depreciation expense of $13.2 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio and German plants. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 251,403 $ 54,244 $ 197,159 363 % Gross margin% 49.9 % 40.2 % Gross profit increased by $197.2 million, or 363%, from $54.2 million in 2006 to $251.4 million in 2007, reflecting an increase in net sales. As a percentage of sales, gross margin increased 9.7 percentage points from 40.2% in 2006 to 49.9% 2007, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our plant expansions, which drove a 259% increase in the number of megawatts sold. Additionally, we incurred $7.6 million of costs, or 1.5% of revenues, associated with the ramp of our German plant in 2007, compared with $1.1 million of costs, or 0.8% of revenues, incurred in 2006 related to the ramp of our Ohio expansion. For fiscal 2007 foreign exchange gains contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our gross margin, offsetting the majority of our annual contractual price decline. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 15,107 $ 6,361 $ 8,746 137 % % of net sales 3.0 % 4.7 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $7.9 million increase in personnel related expense, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $2.3 million in 2006 to $4.7 million in 2007, due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $1.7 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 82,248 $ 33,348 $ 48,900 147 % % of net sales 16.4 % 24.7 % 40 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $36.1 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in share based compensation from $5.3 million in 2006 to $23.4 million in 2007. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $11.3 million and other expenses increased by $1.5 million during 2007, primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company and infrastructure build out to support our growth. Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 16,867 $ 11,725 $ 5,142 44 % % of net sales 3.3 % 8.7 % In 2007, we incurred $16.9 million of production start up expenses related to our German and Malaysia expansions, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $11.7 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and German plant expansions during 2006. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Foreign exchange gain Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain $ 1,881 $ 5,544 $ (3,663 ) N.M. Foreign exchange gain decreased by $3.7 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of hedging the foreign exchange exposure in 2007 to mitigate some of the impact on the fluctuating dollar. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 20,413 $ 2,648 $ 17,765 N.M. The increase in interest income of $17.8 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances throughout 2007. We completed an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of $302.7 million and an equity follow on public offering in the third quarter of 2007, which provided us with net proceeds of $366.0 million. We also had higher investments in 2007 compared to 2006 that generated interest at higher rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 2,294 $ 1,023 $ 1,271 124 % Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased by $1.3 million or 124%, from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2007, we capitalized $3.8 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $3.3 million in 2006. 41 Table of Contents Other expense Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other expense $ 1,219 $ 799 $ 420 N.M. The increase in other expense of $0.4 million was primarily due to increased financing fees related to the IKB loans. Income tax benefit (expense) Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax benefit (expense) $ 2,392 $ (5,206 ) $ 7,598 N.M. Our 2007 annual income tax benefit was $2.4 million. The 2007 tax rate was a benefit of 1.5% which primarily reflects the net of a tax rate of 33.7% and a rate benefit of 35.2% due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $54.9 million. The reversal was based upon our updated assessment of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets. The available positive evidence during fiscal 2007 included cumulative taxable income for the previous twelve quarters and a projection of future taxable income. The income tax expense for 2006 was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation, profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Fiscal Years Ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 134,974 $ 48,063 $ 86,911 181 % Net sales increased by $86.9 million, or 181%, from $48.1 million in 2005 to $135.0 million in 2006. The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 184% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2006 compared to 2005. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of higher throughput, our conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the full production ramp of our Ohio expansion. Net sales in 2006 also benefited from a change in our shipping terms from delivered duty paid to carriage and insurance paid, which became effective in the second quarter of 2006. This change affected revenue recognition by $5.4 million of in transit inventory during the first half of 2006. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 59 watts in 2005 to approximately 63 watts in 2006. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per watt from $2.43 in 2005 to $2.39 in 2006. Our average selling price was positively impacted by $0.05 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and euro. Strong demand from other customers allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 45% of net sales in 2005 to 19% of net sales in 2006. In both periods, almost all of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 80,730 $ 31,483 $ 49,247 156 % % of net sales 59.8 % 65.5 % Cost of sales increased by $49.2 million, or 156%, from $31.5 million in 2005 to $80.7 million in 2006. Direct material expense increased $21.6 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased $3.7 million, direct labor expense increased $3.9 million and sales freight and other 42 Table of Contents costs increased $1.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes during 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $18.9 million, which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $8.7 million, including a $3.3 million increase in share based compensation expense, resulting from the conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the overall infrastructure build out of our Ohio expansion, an increase in facility related expenses of $4.3 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.9 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio expansion. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 54,244 $ 16,580 $ 37,664 227 % Gross margin% 40.2 % 34.5 % Gross profit increased by $37.7 million, or 227%, from $16.6 million in 2005 to $54.2 million in 2006, reflecting an increase in net sales. As a percentage of sales, gross margin increased from 34.5% in 2005 to 40.2% in 2006, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with the expansion of our Ohio plant, which drove a 184% increase in the number of MW sold. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 6,361 $ 2,372 $ 3,989 168 % % of net sales 4.7 % 5.0 % Research and development expense increased by $4.0 million, or 168%, from $2.4 million in 2005 to $6.4 million in 2006. The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $3.2 million increase in personnel related expense, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $0.6 million in 2005 to $2.3 million in 2006, due to increased headcount and additional option awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $0.7 million and grant revenue declined by $0.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 33,348 $ 15,825 $ 17,523 111 % % of net sales 24.7 % 32.9 % Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $17.5 million, or 111%, from $15.8 million in 2005 to $33.3 million in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $12.0 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in share based compensation from $3.4 million in 2005 to $5.3 million in 2006. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $4.8 million and other expenses increased by $0.7 million during 2006, primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company. 43 Table of Contents Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 11,725 $ 3,173 $ 8,552 270 % % of net sales 8.7 % 6.6 % In 2006, we incurred $11.7 million of production start up expenses to qualify our Ohio expansion and ramp our German plant, including related legal and regulatory costs and increased headcount, compared to $3.2 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio expansion during 2005. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses and management of our replication process. Foreign exchange gain (loss) Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain (loss) $ 5,544 $ (1,715 ) $ 7,259 N.M. Foreign exchange gain increased by $7.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of favorable currency translation between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 2,648 $ 316 $ 2,332 N.M. The increase in interest income of $2.3 million was primarily due to higher cash balances as a result of our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $302.7 million. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 1,023 $ 418 $ 605 N.M. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased by $0.6 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2006, we capitalized $3.3 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $0.4 million in 2005. Other (expense) income Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other (expense) income $ (799 ) $ 56 $ (855 ) N.M. The increase in other expense of $0.9 million was primarily due to increased financing fees. Income tax expense Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax expense $ 5,206 $ $ 5,206 N.M. 44 Table of Contents The increase in income tax expense was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation, profitability in 2006, and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Cumulative effect of change in accounting for share based compensation Years Ended Year Over 2006 2005 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cumulative effect $ $ 89 $ (89 ) N.M. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) required a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options resulting in a one time cumulative effect of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, borrowings from JWMA Partners, LLC (JWMA) and its affiliates, borrowings from Goldman, Sachs Co., equity contributions from JWMA and borrowings from local governments, capital markets and other sources to fund plant expansions. During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock. During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007, we received $366.0 million in net proceeds from a follow on offering of our common stock. As of December 29, 2007, we had $669.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $308.4 million as of December 30, 2006. One of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines, such as the recently completed German plant and the plants currently under construction at our Malaysia manufacturing center. We expect that each four line manufacturing plant that we are building in Malaysia will require a capital expenditure of approximately $170.0 million to complete. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, government grants and low interest debt financings for our German plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our expansion strategy. We may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future, which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. See Item 1A: Risk Factors Our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner, both of which are subject risks and uncertainties. We spent $70.1 million in capital expenditures for the Ohio expansion through 2006. In addition, we spent approximately $150.0 million for the build out of our German plant through 2007. We expect to spend approximately $170.0 million to build each of the four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. We spent $229.0 million toward the build out of each of these plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center in 2007 and we expect to spend approximately $377.0 million in 2008 and an additional $74.0 million in 2009. A majority of our capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009 will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Cash Flows Cash provided (used) was as follows for the twelve months ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Operating activities $ 205,951 $ (576 ) $ 5,040 Investing activities (547,250 ) (159,994 ) (43,832 ) Financing activities 430,421 451,550 51,663 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows 7,050 391 385 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 96,172 $ 291,371 $ 13,256 45 Table of Contents Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $206.0 million during 2007 compared to cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million during 2006. Cash provided by interest receivable increased to $20.0 million during 2007 from $2.6 million during 2006 mainly due to the increased cash from the initial public offering and the follow on offering. Cash received from customers increased to $516.0 million during 2007 from $110.2 million during 2006 mainly due to an increase in net sales and shorter payment terms. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and associates of $276.5 million compared to cash paid to suppliers and employees of $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in raw materials, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion and by an increase in cash paid for income taxes of $19.0 million during 2007. Cash used in operating activities was $0.6 million during 2006 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 million during 2005. During 2006, cash received from customers increased by $60.6 million to $110.2 million, mainly due to increased accounts receivable resulting from higher revenues. This increase was offset by cash paid to suppliers and associates of $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in inventories to support revenue growth and other costs supporting our global expansion. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $547.3 million during 2007 compared with $160.0 million during 2006. Cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from capital expenditures of $242.4 million during 2007 and $153.2 million during 2006 and the net purchase of marketable securities of $293.4 million during 2007. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to our investments related to the construction of our new plants in Germany and Malaysia. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $9.5 million and $16.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash paid for the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, net of cash acquired was $5.5 million. Cash used in investing activities was $160.0 million during 2006 compared to $43.8 million during 2005. Cash used for investing activities during 2006 was composed of $153.2 million in capital expenditures for our German plant and the Ohio expansion and $6.8 million in cash placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program, to secure our construction loan for the German plant and to secure an inventory supply contract. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash used in investing activities during 2005 was mainly composed of $42.5 million in capital expenditures for our Ohio expansion and $1.3 million placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $430.4 million during 2007 compared with $451.6 million during 2006. During 2007 we received $366.0 million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $49.4 million from additional draws under debt facilities. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $10.2 million. Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options during 2007 were $30.2 million. In addition, we received $9.5 million in economic development funding from various German governmental entities related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany. These receipts were partially offset by $34.8 million in net repayments of long term debt. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions by JWMA of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts was the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. 46 Table of Contents On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities in the United States. Starting in December 2007, we operated this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of First Solar Electric, LLC. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million), consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see note 5). Cash provided by financing activities was $451.6 million during 2006 compared to $51.7 million during 2005. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions by JWMA of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts was the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. During 2005, cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of a $20.0 million loan from a related party, a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio and a $16.7 million cash equity contribution by JWMA. On October 24, 2006, we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 and up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.001. These amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers, preferences, and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue. On October 30, 2006, our board of directors approved a 4.85 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares, which was effective November 1, 2006; the par value of our common shares remained $0.001 per share, and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2007, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements.

Debt and Credit Sources On July 27, 2006, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Solar, Inc., entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG under which we can draw up to 102.0 million ($149.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) to fund costs of constructing and starting up our German plant. This credit facility consists of a term loan of up to 53.0 million ($77.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) and a revolving credit facility of 27.0 million ($39.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00). The facility also provides for a bridge loan, which we can draw against to fund construction costs that we later expect to be reimbursed through funding from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen), of up to 22.0 million ($32.3 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00). We can make drawdowns against the term loan and the bridge loan until December 30, 2007 and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until September 30, 2012. We have incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling $2.2 million as of December 29, 2007, which we will recognize as interest and other financing expenses over the time that borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility. We also pay an annual commitment fee of 0.6% of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility. At December 29, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings of $67.8 million under the term loan, which we classify as long term debt, and $24.5 million under the bridge loan, which we classify as short term debt. We had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 29, 2007. We must repay the term loan in eighteen quarterly payments beginning on March 31, 2008 and ending on June 29, 2012. We must repay the bridge loan with any funding we receive from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005, but in any event, the bridge loan must be paid in full by December 30, 2008. Once repaid, we may not draw against the term loan or bridge loan facilities. The revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by December 30, 2012. In certain circumstances, we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments, and during 2009, we will also be required to make a one time principal repayment equal to 20% of any surplus cash flow of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH during 2008. Surplus cash flow is a term defined in the credit facility agreement that is approximately equal to cash flow from operating activities less required payments on indebtedness. We pay interest at the annual rate of the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) plus 1.6% on the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% on the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% on the revolving credit facility. Each time we make a draw against the term loan or the bridge loan, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every three or six months; each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one, three or six months. The credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps covering at least 75% of the balance outstanding under the term loan. The Federal Republic of Germany is guaranteeing 48% of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the State of Brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32%. We pay an annual fee, not to exceed 0.5 million ($0.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) for these guarantees. In addition, we must maintain a debt service reserve of 3.0 million ($4.4 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) in a restricted bank account, which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility. Substantially all of our assets in Germany, including the German plant, have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees. The credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flow available for debt service must be at least 1.1 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may not exceed 3.0:1 from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008, 2.5:1 from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 and 1.5:1 from January 1, 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility. 48 Table of Contents The credit facility also contains various non financial covenants with which we must comply. We must submit various financial reports, financial calculations and statistics, operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender. We must adequately insure our German operation and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems. Also, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH cannot open any bank accounts (other than those required by the credit facility), enter into any financial liabilities (other than intercompany obligations, those liabilities required by the credit facility or permitted encumbrances), sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business, make any loans or guarantees to third parties, or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors. Our ability to withdraw cash from First Solar Manufacturing GmbH for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flows from operations must generally be used for the payment of loan interest, fees and principal before any remainder can be used to pay intercompany charges, loans or dividends. Furthermore, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 1.3 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30% of the amount of its total assets. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2% to First Solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products. Also, we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, such as if project related costs exceed our plan, we do not recover the expected amounts from governmental investment subsidies or all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn. If there is a decline in the value of the assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility, we may also be required to pledge additional assets as collateral. On July 26, 2006, we were approved to receive taxable investment incentives (Investitionszuschsse) of approximately 21.5 million ($31.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) from the State of Brandenburg, Germany. These funds will reimburse us for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Receipt of these incentives is conditional upon the State of Brandenburg, Germany having sufficient funds allocated to this program to pay the reimbursements we claim. In addition, we are required to operate our facility for a minimum of five years and employ a specified number of associates during this period. Our incentive approval expires on December 31, 2009. As of December 29, 2007, we had received $29.5 million under this program and we had accrued an additional $1.4 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date. We are eligible to recover up to approximately 23.8 million ($35.0 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) of expenditures related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany under the German Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen). This Act permits us to claim tax exempt reimbursements for certain costs we will incur building our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany, including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Tangible assets subsidized under this program have to remain in the region for at least five years. In accordance with the administrative requirements of this Act, we claimed reimbursement under the Act in conjunction with the filing of our tax returns with the local German tax office during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, this program expired on December 31, 2006 and we can only claim reimbursement for investments completed by this date. The majority of our buildings and structures and our investment in machinery and equipment were completed by this date. As of December 29, 2007, we had accrued $34.4 million eligible to be received under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through the expiration date. During July 2006, we entered into a loan agreement, which we amended and restated on August 7, 2006, with the Estate of John T. Walton under which we could draw up to $34.0 million. Interest was payable monthly at the annual rate of the commercial prime lending rate; principal was to be repaid at the earlier of January 2008 or the completion of an initial public offering of our stock. This loan did not have any collateral requirements. As a condition of obtaining this loan, we were required to use a portion of the proceeds to repay the principal of our loan from Kingston Properties, LLC, a related party. During July 2006, we drew $26.0 million against this loan, 49 Table of Contents $8.7 million of which we used to repay the Kingston Properties, LLC loan. Upon completion of our initial public offering in November 2006, we repaid the entire $26.0 million loan balance. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, $13.2 million of which was outstanding at December 29, 2007. Interest is payable monthly at the annual rate of 2.25%; principal payments commenced on December 1, 2006 and end on July 1, 2015. Land and buildings at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $21.1 million at December 29, 2007 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. During the year ended December 25, 2004, we received a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, of which $3.3 million was outstanding at December 29, 2007. Interest is payable monthly at annual rates starting at 0.25% during the first year the loan is outstanding, increasing to 1.25% during the second and third years, 2.25% during the fourth and fifth years and increasing to 3.25% for each subsequent year; principal payments commenced on January 1, 2007 and end on December 1, 2009. Machinery and equipment at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $7.7 million at December 29, 2007 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. On May 14, 2003, First Solar Property, LLC issued an $8.7 million promissory note due June 1, 2010 to Kingston Properties, LLC. The interest rate of the note was 3.70% per annum. We repaid this note in full in July 2006. On February 22, 2006, we received $73.3 million from the issuance of $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes, less $0.7 million of issuance costs, to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 29, 2007. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for approximately 98.8% of our net sales in 2007 and 95.0% of our net sales in 2006; all of which were denominated in euros. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. Historically, most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. In 2007, a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by $50.4 million. With the expansion of our manufacturing operations into Germany and the current expansion into Malaysia, our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, cash flow and translation: Transaction Exposure: We have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments and accounts payable (including inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables, investments and payables recognized in earnings. 50 Table of Contents As of December 29, 2007, we had a single outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contract with a notional value equivalent to 20.0 million ($26.8 million at a fixed exchange rate of $1.34/1.00), maturing in February 2009, to hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure. Cash Flow Exposure: We have forecasted future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. We initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified this into earnings when the transaction is settled. The notional amount of our cash flow hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment was 112.8 million ($165.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00) and the losses, net of gains, recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2007 were $3.2 million. Earnings Translation Exposure: Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the impact of currency fluctuations. Such contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income, net. We do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our end users depend on debt financing to purchase and install a solar electricity generation system. Although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our end users rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure and final project. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar electricity generation systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar electricity generation systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. During July 2006, we entered into the IKB credit facility, which bears interest at Euribor plus 1.6% for the term loan, Euribor plus 2.0% for the bridge loan and Euribor plus 1.8% for the revolving credit facility. As of December 29, 2007, we hedged our exposure to changes in Euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of 46.0 million ($67.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 29, 2007 of $1.47/1.00). In addition, we invest some of our cash in debt securities, which exposes us to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including money market funds, government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit. As of December 29, 2007, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 5.4%, with a weighted average maturity of three months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 51 Table of Contents 100 basis points, the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $1.6 million. Commodity Risk We are exposed to price risks associated with raw material and component purchases, most significantly tellurium. Presently, we purchase most of our cadmium telluride in compounded form from a limited number of qualified suppliers. We have a long term contract with one of our qualified cadmium telluride suppliers, which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium. Commencing in 2006, we entered into multi year tellurium supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies. We purchase from our other qualified supplier on a purchase order basis. Because the sale prices of solar modules in our Long Term Supply Contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw materials and component supply contracts, we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of our raw materials or components to many of our customers. In addition, most of our key raw materials and components are either sole sourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers. As a result, the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations. If our existing suppliers fail to perform, we will be required to identify and qualify new suppliers, a process that can take up to 12 months depending on the raw material or component. We might be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production line on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms. 52 Table of Contents
