In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 28 Table of Contents Overview We design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world. Each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. We manufacture our solar modules on high throughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated, proprietary, continuous process. During 2006, 2007 and 2008, we sold most of our solar modules to solar power system developers, system integrators and operators headquartered in Germany, France and Spain. Currently, we manufacture our solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and Kulim, Malaysia manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility. Our average manufacturing cost per watt has decreased from $2.94 during 2004 to $1.08 during 2008. We define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during a period divided by the total watts produced during that period. By continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt. We were founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research, development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in January 2002. On February 22, 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Prior to that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and Fortune 500 companies in the United States. We have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business. This business sells solar power systems directly to system owners. These systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties. We also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the United States, such as the system design, engineering, procurement of permits and balance of system components, construction management, monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery. This acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in North America to deliver solar electricity solutions to utility companies. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million); consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2008; all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2007; and all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2006. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity As of December 27, 2008 we operated 19 production lines at our plants in Perrysburg, Ohio, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and Kulim, Malaysia. After completion of plant four at our Malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio plant we will have 24 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1145 MW (based on the fourth quarter of 2008 run rate at our existing plants). Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. 29 Table of Contents Net Sales We generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules. We price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price. We currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers, system integrators and operators headquartered in Germany, France and Spain, which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell. The solar industry has been moving from a supply driven to a demand driven industry, with increasing competitive pressure as the supply of solar modules exceeds current demand. Our customers face significant challenges under the current economic conditions, including an increase in interest or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital to finance solar projects. Our net sales could be adversely impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in Europe, North America or Asia or if interest rates increase or financing is no longer available, which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects. In addition, subsidies for our customers, particularly in Germany, are declining at a rate that is greater than the annual contractual price decline we extend under our Long Term Supply Contracts. As result, we may be less competitive and not meet our customers internal rate of return (IRR) or the profit margin of our customers might decline, which could lower demand for our solar panels. Our sales prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts are denominated in euro, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 95% of our sales are denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and U.S. dollar. For example, the strengthening of the euro during 2008 increased our net sales by 6% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. In April 2006, we entered into long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European solar power system project developers and system integrators, and in 2007, we entered into additional long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six other European project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects. In 2008, we entered into long term contracts with three European project developers, system integrators and operators and increased our contracted volume with four customers. We also entered into a five year agreement with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the United States, which is a related party. These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2009 through 2013, and therefore, will significantly affect our overall financial performance. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2006 require us to deliver solar modules each year that, in total, meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year. Under these Long Term Supply Contracts, we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5% annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3% for modules delivered in 2012. If we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year, we will be in breach of the applicable agreements, entitling our customers to certain remedies, potentially including the right to terminate their Long Term Supply Contracts. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2007 do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases 3 4% annually from 2008 to 2010/2011, and then remains fixed through 2012, and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module. As of December 27, 2008, all of our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 6.5% at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in 2012. Because the sales prices under our Long Term Supply Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit. Our Long Term Supply Contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately $5.8 billion (4.9 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of $1.15/1.00 and 0.2 billion denominated in USD) in sales from 2009 to 2013. During 2008, we amended a Long Term Supply Contract with one customer, which reduced the volume of solar modules delivered to such customer in 2008 and also reduced the volume of solar modules to be delivered over the remaining term of the agreement to such customer. During February 2009 we amended our Long Term Supply Contracts with two customers to accelerate the decline in the sales price per watt under such contracts in 2009 and 30 Table of Contents 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under such contracts. We are currently in discussions with several other customers about making similar amendments to their Long Term Supply Contracts. The annual decline in the sales price under our Long Term Supply Contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 5 6% each year, assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat, and will impact our cash flow accordingly. As a result, our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease. Under our customer contracts, starting in April 2006, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Under our customer contracts in effect prior to April 1, 2006, we did not transfer title or risk of loss, or recognize revenue, until the solar modules were received by our customers. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. We have the right to terminate certain Long Term Supply Contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred, including, depending on the contract one or more of the following: new laws, rules or regulations with respect to our production, distribution, installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business; unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread, persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels; or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor, materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput. The average termination fee under those agreements is $4.2 million ranging from $0.7 million to $8.0 million. Our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the Long Term Supply Contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the case of a late delivery, certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, we began accounting for a portion of our revenues using the percent of completion method of accounting. Revenues for our solar power systems and project development business for the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 were $53.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and were not material to our consolidated results of operations. During 2008, our principal customers were Blitzstrom GmbH, Colexon Energy AG (previously Reinecke + Pohl), Conergy AG, Juwi Solar GmbH and Phoenix Solar AG. During 2008, each of these five customers individually accounted for between 11% and 19% of our net sales. All of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10% of our net sales during 2008. Cost of sales Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components, such as tempered back glass, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated front glass, cadmium telluride, laminate, connector assemblies, laminate edge seal and others. Other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety expenses, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and solar module end of life collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales. We implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our collection and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials. In return, the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our end of life collection and recycling 31 Table of Contents program or another program that we approve of, and the solar power system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future end of life collection and recycling obligation. We subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation, which we classify with selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per line, geographic diversification into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials we have procured for customer projects. We recognize these costs as deferred assets until we install the materials. Deferred project costs were $0.7 million at December 27, 2008. Gross profit Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines 6.5% at the beginning of each year. Another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached. As a result, gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. We continually add equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense. We may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the Ohio expansion to research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes. We maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the United States Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. During the past four years, we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs. We received $0.9 million, $1.8 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the 32 Table of Contents selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. Production start up expenses during 2006 were $11.7 million due to the qualification of our Ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of our German plant. We incurred production start up expense of $16.9 million during 2007 in connection with the qualification of the German plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. Production start up expense during 2008 was $32.5 million relating to the planning and preparation of our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center. In general, we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. We also expect to incur production start up expenses during 2009 related to our expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility and plant four at the Malaysian manufacturing center. Over time, we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Interest income Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, is incurred on various debt financings. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are further described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 27, 2008 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are as follows: Revenue recognition. We sell our products directly to solar power system integrators and operators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. This policy is in accordance with the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB 104, Revision of Topic 13 (Revenue Recognition). Under this policy, we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the sales contract. We do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, a portion of our revenues will be derived from long term contracts that we account for under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. (SOP) 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and 33 Table of Contents Certain Production Type Contracts. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on long term fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition. If we identify any losses on contracts, we will recognize those losses immediately. Contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks, estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Furthermore, contract change orders, claims and similar items, require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. We only include contract change orders, claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable. Incurred costs include all direct material, labor, subcontractor cost, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies and tools. We recognize job material costs as incurred costs when the job materials have been installed. When contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation, using the percentage of completion method of accounting. We consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design. Our liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, which is part of the balance sheet caption Other current liabilities, was $2.2 million and $2.1 million as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively. This liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts, which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies. We also have a limited number of revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables. These are contracts under which we provide design and consulting services for and we supply parts and equipment for solar power systems. We follow the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, in order to determine whether these arrangements have more than one unit of accounting. According to EITF 00 21, deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer, if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available, and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items. We determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar power system parts and equipment. We apply the same revenue recognition principles (from SAB 104) as we use for our arrangements for the stand alone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with SOP 81 1. End of life collection and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold. We base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation site to a recycling center, the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. We base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. In the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. At December 27, 2008, our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was $35.2 million. A 10 percent decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by $3.5 million, to $31.7 million; a 10 percent increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by $3.5 million, to $38.7 million. Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules. We also warrant to the 34 Table of Contents owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years. Our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. During the years ended December 30, 2006, December 29, 2007 and December 27, 2008, our estimate of our product warranty liability did not require significant adjustments. Share based compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards on their grant dates. We adopted SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2005 using the modified retrospective method of transition. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 107, which provides guidance regarding the implementation of SFAS 123(R). In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in share based compensation valuation models, the classification of share based compensation expense, the capitalization of share based compensation costs and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis in filings with the SEC. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant using that valuation model requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes Merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options, which is consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes Merton formula, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return. Because our stock has only recently become publicly traded, we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility; therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data to refer to from our own traded share price. We estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding. If we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future share based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards, even if the critical terms of the awards are similar. Higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which we expect to vest. Quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates and further adjustments when the awards actually vest can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation. Increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters. Decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters. These adjustments affect our cost of sales, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative and production start up expenses. The adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments as certain awards completed their vesting period reduced our share based compensation expense by $0.6 million in the year ended December 30, 2006 and increased our share based compensation expense by $2.9 million and $0.9 million in the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 27, 2008, respectively. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of share based awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments when the awards actually vest. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. Our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities. Our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules. We account for any impairment of our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result, we assess long lived assets 35 Table of Contents classified as held and used, including our property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. We evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 and did not note any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable. Accounting for Income Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate. We establish liabilities for potential losses that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Once established, we adjust the liabilities when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net non current amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We do not amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and, if necessary, we would record any impairment in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach methodology of valuation, which considers values of comparable businesses, to determine the fair value of our goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach. We reported $33.8 million of goodwill at December 27, 2008, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from Turner Renewable Energy, LLC. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 27, 2008 and concluded 36 Table of Contents that it was not impaired. Testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps. The first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed. That step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities. Any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill, and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss. In our test during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the fair value of our solar power systems reporting unit, which contains all of our goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by approximately 80 percent. As a result, we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable. Marketable Securities. We have classified our marketable securities as available for sale and present them at fair value on our balance sheet, with gains and losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. We determine the realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities using the specific identification cost method. All of our available for sale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. We consider our marketable debt securities impaired when their fair value is less than their carrying value. We subject investments identified as being impaired to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we would write down the investment to its impaired value and establish that amount as its new cost basis. We measure the fair value of our marketable securities using quoted prices for securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs (such as interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals) and we consider the effect of our counterparties credit standings in these fair value measurements. Determining the observable market values most relevant to the measurement of the fair value of marketable securities and the further counterparty credit risk adjustment to those values, if needed, requires significant judgment. Changes in market conditions can also significantly affect the fair value measurements from period to period and can cause realized values to vary significantly from previous estimates. Valuation of Derivative Instruments. We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk; we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We believe that there are two aspects of accounting for our derivative instruments that require us to make significant estimates and judgments: measuring the fair values of the derivative instruments and applying special hedge accounting rules to some of them. We report our derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information about how we measure the fair values of our derivative instruments. We believe that the types of derivative instruments that we use are commonly used by many companies outside the financial services industry and have well established valuation models, which we apply. Also, we believe that there are readily available, reliable sources for the information that we need as inputs to these valuation models. However, the selection of the valuation models and the inputs we use in them still does require us to exercise significant judgment about their relevance to our measurement, any adjustments that they may require to properly measure our particular derivative instruments and their reliability. We also note that the amounts that we use as valuation model inputs can change significantly from one period to another as markets fluctuate. This can cause the fair value that we estimate for any specific derivative instrument to vary significantly from one period to another. We designate some of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges pursuant to SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Under cash flow hedge accounting, we record the portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument that offsets, within a specified range, the change in the fair value of the specified future cash flow that it hedges as a component of other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flow affects the computation of our current income. At that time, we reclassify this effective portion of the net change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to current income. Among other things, cash flow hedge accounting requires us to test each hedging derivative instrument at the inception of the hedging relationship and at the end of each reporting period thereafter for its effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow. If we determine that the overall hedging relationship is 37 Table of Contents ineffective, we must discontinue cash flow hedge accounting for the derivative instrument and record all its future fair value changes in current income. SFAS 133 also requires us to measure any portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument that is not effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow and record that measured ineffectiveness in our current income. Because of these requirements, our estimates and judgments that affect the amounts that we measure for the fair value of our derivative instruments, and the hedged cash flows, can also have a significant impact on how we present changes in those fair values in our financial statements (current income versus other comprehensive income). Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006: Years Ended December 27, December 29, December 30, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 45.6 % 50.1 % 59.8 % Gross profit 54.4 % 49.9 % 40.2 % Research and development 2.7 % 3.0 % 4.7 % Selling, general and administrative 14.0 % 16.4 % 24.7 % Production start up 2.6 % 3.3 % 8.7 % Operating income 35.1 % 27.2 % 2.1 % Foreign currency gain (loss) 0.5 % 0.4 % 4.1 % Interest income 1.7 % 4.1 % 2.0 % Interest expense, net 0.0 % (0.5 )% (0.8 )% Other income (expense), net (0.1 )% (0.3 )% (0.6 )% Income tax expense (benefit) 9.3 % (0.5 )% 3.9 % Net income 27.9 % 31.4 % 2.9 % Fiscal Years Ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 1,246,301 $ 503,976 $ 742,325 147 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 148% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold during 2008 compared with 2007 due to strong demand for our solar modules in Europe. The increase in MW volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of our German plant, commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 4% during 2008 compared with 2007. Our average selling price decreased by approximately 1% during 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to a 6.5% contractual price decline, partially offset by a 6% increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Approximately 74% of our net sales during 2008 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. 38 Table of Contents Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 567,908 $ 252,573 $ 315,335 125 % % of net sales 45.6 % 50.1 % The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes, which resulted from the full production ramp of our German facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. These factors caused a $191.1 million increase in direct material expense, a $13.8 million increase in warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules, a $9.4 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a $101.0 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs. The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $40.5 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses, including a $2.4 million increase in share based compensation expense, a $30.7 million increase in facility and related expenses and a $29.8 million increase in depreciation expense, in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our German and Malaysian expansions. Our cost of sales during 2008 reflects a benefit of $2.0 million resulting from a change in the estimated amount of our warranty obligation. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 678,393 $ 251,403 $ 426,990 170 % % of net sales 54.4 % 49.9 % As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 4.5 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our German and Malaysian expansions, which drove a 148% increase in the number of megawatts sold. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased by 9% during 2008, while our average selling prices decreased by 1%. During 2008, foreign exchange gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed approximately 1.9% and 5.6%, respectively, to our gross profit, partially offset by a 3.0% decline in our average selling prices. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 33,517 $ 15,107 $ 18,410 122 % % of net sales 2.7 % 3.0 % The increase in our research and development expense was due to a $13.7 million increase in personnel related expense, including a $1.2 million increase in share based compensation expense, due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. In addition, consulting and other expenses increased by $3.8 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million during 2008 compared with 2007. Throughout 2008, we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 174,039 $ 82,248 $ 91,791 112 % % of net sales 14.0 % 16.4 % 39 Table of Contents The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was due to a $62.0 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses, including a $15.5 million increase in share based compensation. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $13.0 million and other expenses increased by $16.8 million during 2008. The increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our solar power system and project development business as well as operating a global manufacturing business. Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 32,498 $ 16,867 $ 15,631 93 % % of net sales 2.6 % 3.3 % During 2008, we incurred $32.5 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and Malaysian manufacturing expansion, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $16.9 million of production start up expenses for our German and Malaysian plant expansions during 2007. Production start up expenses are primarily the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Foreign exchange gain Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain $ 5,722 $ 1,881 $ 3,841 204 % Foreign exchange gain increased by $3.8 million during 2008 due to a substantial increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and high volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, in particular the euro. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 21,158 $ 20,413 $ 745 4 % Interest income remained relatively flat primarily as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2008, offset by a decline in interest rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 509 $ 2,294 $ (1,785 ) (78 )% Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized due to the construction of our Malaysian manufacturing center. Other expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other expense, net $ 934 $ 1,219 $ (285 ) (23 )% 40 Table of Contents Other expense, net consisted mainly of financing fees related to our credit facilities. During 2008, other expense was reduced by a mark to market gain of $0.6 million associated with our credit default swap. Income tax expense (benefit) Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands)} Income tax expense (benefit) $ 115,446 $ (2,392 ) $ 117,838 N.M. Effective tax rate 24.9 % (1.5 %) Income tax expense increased by $117.8 million, primarily due to the increase in pre tax income of $307.8 million, as well as the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2007 of $54.9 million. Our Malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of 16.5 years, which was originally scheduled to commence on January 1, 2009, which generally provides for a 100% exemption from Malaysian income tax. Subsequent to year end we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year. Due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of 2008, we concluded that the financial impact will be reflected in our first quarter of 2009 financial results. As a result we will recognize an income tax benefit of $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2009. Had the exemption from Malaysian tax against our 2008 income been granted during 2008, our 2008 income tax expense would have been reduced by $11.6 million to $103.8 million. The effective tax rate would have been 22.4% rather than 24.9%. Fiscal Years Ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 503,976 $ 134,974 $ 369,002 273 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 259% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2007 compared to 2006. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of the production ramp at our German plant, the full production of our Ohio expansion and continued improvements to our overall process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 11% in 2007 compared with 2006. Our average selling price increased by 4% during 2007 compared with 2006, mainly due to a 9% increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, partially offset by a 5% annual contractual price decline. Approximately 91% of our net sales in 2007 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 252,573 $ 80,730 $ 171,843 213 % % of net sales 50.1 % 59.8 % Direct material expense increased by $87.3 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased by $9.1 million, sales freight and other costs increased by $3.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes in 2007 compared with 2006. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $72.2 million, which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $43.0 million, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $4.2 million in 2006 to $9.5 million in 2007, resulting from the infrastructure associated with our Ohio expansion and German plant build out, facility and related expenses of $16.0 million and depreciation expense of $13.2 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio and German plants. 41 Table of Contents Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 251,403 $ 54,244 $ 197,159 363 % % of net sales 49.9 % 40.2 % As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 9.7 percentage points from 2006 to 2007, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our plant expansions, which drove a 259% increase in the number of megawatts sold. During 2007, foreign exchange gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed 3.0% and 9.8%, respectively, to our gross profit, partially offset by a 3.1% annual contractual price decline. Additionally, we incurred $7.6 million of costs, or 1.5% of revenues, associated with the ramp of our German plant in 2007, compared with $1.1 million of costs, or 0.8% of revenues, incurred in 2006 related to the ramp of our Ohio expansion. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 15,107 $ 6,361 $ 8,746 137 % % of net sales 3.0 % 4.7 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $7.9 million increase in personnel related expense, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $2.3 million in 2006 to $4.7 million in 2007, due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $1.7 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 82,248 $ 33,348 $ 48,900 147 % % of net sales 16.4 % 24.7 % Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $36.1 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in share based compensation from $5.3 million in 2006 to $23.4 million in 2007. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $11.3 million and other expenses increased by $1.5 million during 2007, primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company and infrastructure build out to support our growth. Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 16,867 $ 11,725 $ 5,142 44 % % of net sales 3.3 % 8.7 % In 2007, we incurred $16.9 million of production start up expenses related to our German and Malaysia expansions, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $11.7 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and German plant expansions during 2006. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. 42 Table of Contents Foreign exchange gain Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain $ 1,881 $ 5,544 $ (3,663 ) N.M. Foreign exchange gain decreased by $3.7 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of hedging the foreign exchange exposure in 2007 to mitigate some of the impact on the fluctuating dollar. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 20,413 $ 2,648 $ 17,765 N.M. The increase in interest income of $17.8 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances throughout 2007. We completed an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of $302.7 million and an equity follow on public offering in the third quarter of 2007, which provided us with net proceeds of $366.0 million. We also had higher investments in 2007 compared to 2006 that generated interest at higher rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 2,294 $ 1,023 $ 1,271 124 % Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased by $1.3 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2007, we capitalized $3.8 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $3.3 million in 2006. Other expense Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other expense $ 1,219 $ 799 $ 420 N.M. The increase in other expense of $0.4 million was primarily due to increased financing fees related to the IKB loans. Income tax expense (benefit) Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax expense (benefit) $ (2,392 ) $ 5,206 $ (7,598 ) N.M. Our 2007 tax rate was a benefit of 1.5% which primarily reflects the net of a tax rate of 33.7% and a rate benefit of 35.2% due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $54.9 million. The reversal was based upon our updated assessment of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets. The available positive evidence during fiscal 2007 included cumulative taxable income for the previous twelve quarters and a projection of future taxable income. The income tax expense for 2006 was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation, profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 27, 2008, we had $821.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared with $669.7 million as of December 29, 2007. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, government grants and low interest debt financings for our German and Malaysian plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan. As a result, we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future, which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. See Item 1A: Risk Factors Our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner, both of which are subject risks and uncertainties. The recent and unprecedented disruption in the current credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. As of December 27, 2008, our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. However, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. Cash Flows Cash provided (used) was as follows for the twelve months ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006 (in thousands): Years Ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating activities $ 463,067 $ 205,951 $ (576 ) Investing activities (308,441 ) (547,250 ) (159,994 ) Financing activities 177,549 430,421 451,550 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows (20,221 ) 7,050 391 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 311,954 $ 96,172 $ 291,371 Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $463.1 million during 2008 compared with $206.0 million during 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses in this period as well as the impact of non cash items that were recorded on the statements of income, primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation expense, offset by investments in accounts receivable and inventories to support growth. Our inventories increased by $84.8 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in raw materials and work in process as a result of revenue growth. Income taxes paid, net of refunds during 2008 were $2.0 million. Cash received from customers increased to $1,203.8 million during 2008 from $516.0 million during 2007 primarily due to an increase in net sales. Our net sales increased from $504.0 million during 2007 to $1,246.3 million in 2008. This increase was partially offset by cash paid to suppliers and employees of $723.1 million during 2008 compared with cash paid to suppliers and associates of $276.5 million during 2007, mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion. Cash provided by operating activities was $206.0 million during 2007 compared to cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million during 2006. Cash provided by interest earned increased to $20.0 million during 2007 from $2.6 million during 2006 mainly due to the increased cash from the initial public offering and the follow on offering. Cash received from customers increased to $516.0 million during 2007 from $110.2 million during 2006 mainly due to an increase in net sales and shorter payment terms. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees of $276.5 million compared to cash paid to suppliers and employees of 44 Table of Contents $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in raw materials, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion. Also, we paid cash of $19.0 million for income taxes during 2007. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $308.4 million during 2008 compared with $547.3 million during 2007. Cash used in investing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from capital expenditures of $459.3 million, an equity investment of $25.0 million and an increase of $15.5 million in restricted accounts, offset by the net sale of marketable securities of $191.4 million. During 2008, we placed $15.5 million of cash in restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program and in October 2008, we made an equity investment of $25.0 million in a U.S based company that will supply solar power plants to residential and commercial customers. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to our investments related to the construction of our new plants in Malaysia and Germany. We expect to spend approximately $300.0 million in capital expenditures for 2009 mainly related to the build out of our Malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio plant. A majority of our capital expenditures for 2009 will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Cash used in investing activities was $547.3 million during 2007 compared with $160.0 million during 2006. Cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from capital expenditures of $242.4 million during 2007 and $153.2 million during 2006 and the net purchase of marketable securities of $293.4 million during 2007. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to our investments related to the construction of our new plants in Germany and Malaysia. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $9.5 million and $16.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash paid for the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, net of cash acquired during 2007 was $5.5 million. During 2007 and 2006, we deposited $6.0 million and $6.8 million of cash into restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $177.5 million during 2008 compared with $430.4 million during 2007. Cash provided by financing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from investment incentives related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany of $35.7 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of issuance costs, of $138.9 million related to the equipment export financing agreement for our Malaysian manufacturing center. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these credit facilities. These cash proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of long term debt of $41.7 million during 2008. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2008 were $16.0 million mainly due to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2007 were $376.1 million mainly due to the receipt of $366.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $10.2 million of proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options. Excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements during 2008 were $28.7 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $430.4 million during 2007 compared with $451.6 million during 2006. During 2007 we received $366.0 million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $49.4 million from additional draws under debt facilities. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $10.2 million. Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options during 2007 were $30.2 million. In addition, we received $9.5 million in economic development funding from various German governmental entities related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany. These receipts were partially offset by $34.8 million in net repayments of long term debt. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions from our sole owner prior to our IPO of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental 45 Table of Contents entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts was the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar power system projects for utilities in the United States. We have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business. This business sells solar power systems directly to system owners. These systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties. We also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the United States, such as the system design, engineering, procurement of permits and balance of system components, construction management, monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery. This acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in North America for solar electricity solutions to utility companies. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million); consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). On October 24, 2006, we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 and up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.001. These amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers, preferences, and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue. On October 30, 2006, our board of directors approved a 4.85 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares, which was effective November 1, 2006; the par value of our common shares remained $0.001 per share, and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 27, 2008, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements.

In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, we have recorded $7.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. 46 Table of Contents Debt and Credit Sources On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion at our Malaysian manufacturing center, First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (FS Malaysia), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary entered into an export financing facility agreement (Facility Agreement) with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) as arranger NATIXIS Zweigniederlassung Deutschland (NZD) as facility agent and original lender, AKA Ausfuhrkredit Gesellschaft mbH (AKA), as original lender and NATIXIS Labuan Branch (NLB) as security agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement, the lenders will furnish up to 134.0 million ($187.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) of credit facilities consisting of the following: (1) Five fixed rate euro denominated term loan facilities, which have the following maximum aggregate amounts: a) 16.9 million ($23.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); b) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); c) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); d) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); e) 1.2 million ($1.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); and (2) Five floating rate euro denominated term loan facilities, which have the following maximum aggregate amounts: a) 16.9 million ($23.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); b) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); c) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); d) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); and e) 1.2 million ($1.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). The loans under the fixed rate credit facilities will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at an annual rate of 4.54%. The loans under the floating rate credit facilities will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at Euribor plus a margin of 0.55%. These credit facilities are intended to be used by FS Malaysia for the purpose of (1) partially financing the purchase of certain equipment to be used at our Malaysian manufacturing center and (2) financing fees to be paid to Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs AG (Euler Hermes), the German Export Credit Agency of Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany, which will guaranty 95% of FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement (Hermes Guaranty). In addition, FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar, Inc., pursuant to a guaranty agreement described below. The Facility Agreement requires FS Malaysia to make 14 equal semi annual repayments of the total principal borrowed under each of the credit facilities listed above. The first of these repayments commences on the earlier of (1) the day that is nine months after the date that the Malaysian manufacturing center plant to which the credit facility relates becomes ready for operation and (2) a date specified for each credit facility, the earliest of which is 47 Table of Contents September 30, 2008 for the credit facilities listed as (1) a) and (2) a) above. Principal repayments commenced on September 30, 2008. FS Malaysia may voluntarily cancel commitments under the credit facilities and may make prepayments of amounts outstanding, in whole or in part, subject to minimum prepayment requirements and the payment of break costs. Subject to a limited exception, in the event that the Euler Hermes Guaranty is (1) fully or partially withdrawn, or otherwise ceases to be in full force and effect or (2) repudiated by Euler Hermes (or its intention to repudiate is evidenced in writing), or if any of the obligations of Euler Hermes under the Euler Hermes Guaranty ceases to be legal, valid, binding or in full force and effect, the loans made by any lender under any of the credit facilities may, at the direction of the lender, be declared immediately due and payable. FS Malaysia is obligated to pay commitment fees at an annual rate of 0.375% on the unused portions of the fixed rate credit facilities and at an annual rate of 0.350% on the unused portions of the floating rate credit facilities. In addition, FS Malaysia is obligated to pay certain underwriting, management and agency fees in connection with the credit facilities. In connection with the Facility Agreement, First Solar, Inc. entered into a first demand guaranty agreement dated May 6, 2008 in favor of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Facility Agreement. As stated above, FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar pursuant to this guaranty agreement. In connection with the Facility Agreement, all of FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement are secured by a first party, first legal charge over the equipment financed by the credit facilities and the other documents, contracts and agreements related to that equipment. Also in connection with the Facility Agreement, any payment claims of First Solar, Inc. against FS Malaysia are subordinated to the claims of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Facility Agreement. The Facility Agreement contains various financial covenants with which we must comply, such as debt to equity ratios, total leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. We must submit these ratios related to the financial covenants for the first time at the end of fiscal 2009. The Facility Agreement also contains various customary non financial covenants with which FS Malaysia must comply, including, submitting various financial reports and business forecasts to the lenders, maintaining adequate insurance, complying with applicable laws and regulations and restricting on FS Malaysias ability to sell or encumber assets and make loan guarantees to third parties. We were in compliance with these covenants through December 27, 2008. As of December 27, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of 93.3 million ($130.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) under the Facility Agreement. On July 27, 2006, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Solar, Inc., entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG under which we could draw up to 102.0 million ($142.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) to fund costs of constructing and starting up our German plant. This credit facility consisted of a term loan of up to 53.0 million ($74.2 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) and a revolving credit facility of 27.0 million ($37.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). The facility also provided for a bridge loan, which we drew against to fund construction costs that were later reimbursed through funding from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen), of up to 22.0 million ($30.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). We can no longer make draw downs against the term loan and the bridge loan, and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until September 30, 2012. We incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling $2.2 million through December 29, 2007, which we recognized as interest and other financing expenses over the time that the borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. We did not incur any costs related to the credit facility during fiscal 2008. We also pay an annual commitment fee of 0.6% of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility. At December 27, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of $55.0 million under the term loan, $42.0 million of which we classify as long term debt and $13.0 million of which we classify as the current portion of long term debt. We had no outstanding borrowings under the bridge loan at December 27, 2008. We repaid the bridge loan in 48 Table of Contents February 2008 with funding we received from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant of 2005 and we cannot make any more draws against the bridge loan facility. We also had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 27, 2008. At December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, interest rates were 6.7% and 6.3%, respectively, for the term loan; however, on January 1, 2009, the interest rate reset to 4.6%. We must repay the term loan in twenty quarterly payments beginning on March 31, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2012. Once repaid, we may not draw again against the term loan facility. The revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by December 31, 2012. In certain circumstances, we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments. We pay interest at the annual rate of the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) plus 1.6% on the term loan and Euribor plus 1.8% on the revolving credit facility. Each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one, three, or six months. The credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps covering at least 75% of the balance outstanding under the term loan. The Federal Republic of Germany is guaranteeing 48% of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the State of Brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32%. We pay an annual fee, not to exceed 0.5 million ($0.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) for these guarantees. In addition, we must maintain a debt service reserve of 3.0 million ($4.2 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) in a restricted investment account, which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility. Substantially all of our assets in Germany, including the German plant, have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees. The credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flow available for debt service must be at least 1.1 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may not exceed 3.0:1 from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008, 2.5:1 from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 and 1.5:1 from January 1, 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility. The credit facility also contains various non financial covenants with which we must comply. We must submit various financial reports, financial calculations and statistics, operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender. We must adequately insure our German operation, and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems. Also, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH cannot open any bank accounts (other than those required by the credit facility), sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business, make any loans or guarantees to third parties or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors. We were in compliance with these covenants through December 27, 2008. Our ability to withdraw cash from First Solar Manufacturing GmbH for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 1.3 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30% of the amount of its total assets. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2% to First Solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products. Furthermore, we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, such as if all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, $11.7 million of which was outstanding at December 27, 2008. Interest is payable monthly at the annual rate of 2.25%; principal payments commenced on December 1, 2006 and end on July 1, 2015. Land and buildings at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $21.1 million at December 27, 2008 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. During the year ended December 25, 2004, we received a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, of which $1.5 million was outstanding at December 27, 2008. Interest is payable monthly at 49 Table of Contents annual rates starting at 0.25% during the first year the loan is outstanding, increasing to 1.25% during the second and third years, increasing to 2.25% during the fourth and fifth years and increasing to 3.25% for each subsequent year; principal payments commenced on January 1, 2007 and end on December 1, 2009. Machinery and equipment at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $7.7 million at December 27, 2008 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. Our debt financing agreements bear interest based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). Euribor is the primary interbank lending rate within the Euro zone, with maturities ranging from one week to one year. A disruption of the credit environment as currently experienced could negatively impact interbank lending and therefore negatively impact the Euribor rate. An increase in the Euribor rate would increase our cost of borrowing. On December 30, 2007, the beginning of our fiscal year 2008, we adopted SFAS 157. Our adoption of SFAS 157 was limited to our financial assets and financial liabilities, as permitted by FSP 157 2. We do not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that we recognize or disclose at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis. Our adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations, and our fair value models do not make material use of unobservable inputs. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our adoption of SFAS 157. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 27, 2008. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for 95% of our net sales during 2008 and 98.8% of our net sales during 2007; all of these international sales were denominated in euro. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. In the past, most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. For the year ended December 27, 2008, a 10% change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by $118.3 million. With the expansion of our manufacturing operations into Germany and the current expansion into Malaysia, many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, cash flow and translation: Transaction Exposure: We have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments, accounts payable (including inter company transactions) and debt that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the effect of short term foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on these assets and liabilities. As of December 27, 2008, the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with U.S. dollars was 175.2 million ($245.3 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to sell euros for U.S. dollars was 123.0 million 50 Table of Contents ($172.2 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); and the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Malaysian ringgit with U.S. dollars was MYR 148.0 million ($42.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $0.29/MYR1.00). As of December 27, 2008, the unrealized loss of these forward contracts was $0.8 million. These foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. These currency forward contracts hedge third party balance sheet exposure. If the U.S. dollar would have weakened by 10%, the adverse impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro and Malaysian ringgit would have been $7.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Cash Flow Exposure: We have forecasted future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. We initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify it into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled. Most of our German plants operating expenses are denominated in euros, creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales. In addition, we purchased forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro. As of December 27, 2008, the total notional value of these forward contracts was 625.1 million ($875.1 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). Earnings Translation Exposure: Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations. These contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income, net. We do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future. In the past, currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by $20.2 million during 2008 and positively impacted our cash flows by $7.1 million during 2007. Although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we have increased risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system. Although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system. This could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. During 2006, we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks, which bears interest at Euribor plus 1.6%. As of December 27, 2008, we hedged our exposure to changes in Euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of 39.1 million ($54.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). 51 Table of Contents During May of 2008, we entered into a credit facility with IKB, Natixis, Natixis Labuan Branch and Ausfuhrkredit Gesellschaft mbH which is denominated in euro. The loans under fixed rate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 4.54%. The loans under the floating rate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at Euribor plus a margin of 0.55%. In addition, we invest some of our cash in debt securities, which exposes us to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the market value of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including money market funds, government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit. As of December 27, 2008, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 1.6%, with a weighted average maturity of 6.1 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $0.9 million. The direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of December 27, 2008, all of our investments were in money market accounts, federal and foreign agency debt and corporate debt securities. Commodity and Component Risk We are exposed to price risks for the raw materials, components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules. Also, some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier. We endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers, a process which could take up to 12 months if successful, but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers. In some cases, we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components, but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our Long Term Supply Contracts with our customers. As a result, we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our modules. In addition, a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process. Since our selling price under our Long Term Supply Contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our Long Term Supply Contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their term, we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption. Credit Risk We have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable, interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments. We place cash, cash equivalents, investments, interest rate swap agreements and enter into derivative contracts with high quality financial institutions, and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty. We continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions. In addition, we have certain restricted investments that are exposed to credit risk. These consist primarily of restricted investments, which are held by a subsidiary of a financial services company to fund our estimated future product collection and recycling costs. As of December 27, 2008 our restricted investments with this financial services company were $25.8 million. In October 2008 we entered into credit default swaps (CDS) against the parent company of this financial services company to protect our investment from a significant pre defined credit event to our counter party. Under a CDS, a third party assumes for a fee, a portion of the credit risk related to the investment. The CDS we entered into provides protection for losses in the event of a pre defined credit event of the parent company of the financial services company up to $25.0 million. These CDS expire on March 20, 2009 and June 20, 2009, respectively. 52 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 28 Table of Contents Overview We design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world. Each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. We manufacture our solar modules on high throughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated, proprietary, continuous process. During 2006, 2007 and 2008, we sold most of our solar modules to solar power system developers, system integrators and operators headquartered in Germany, France and Spain. Currently, we manufacture our solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and Kulim, Malaysia manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility. Our average manufacturing cost per watt has decreased from $2.94 during 2004 to $1.08 during 2008. We define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during a period divided by the total watts produced during that period. By continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt. We were founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research, development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in January 2002. On February 22, 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Prior to that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and Fortune 500 companies in the United States. We have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business. This business sells solar power systems directly to system owners. These systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties. We also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the United States, such as the system design, engineering, procurement of permits and balance of system components, construction management, monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery. This acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in North America to deliver solar electricity solutions to utility companies. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million); consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2008; all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2007; and all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2006. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity As of December 27, 2008 we operated 19 production lines at our plants in Perrysburg, Ohio, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and Kulim, Malaysia. After completion of plant four at our Malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio plant we will have 24 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1145 MW (based on the fourth quarter of 2008 run rate at our existing plants). Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. 29 Table of Contents Net Sales We generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules. We price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price. We currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers, system integrators and operators headquartered in Germany, France and Spain, which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell. The solar industry has been moving from a supply driven to a demand driven industry, with increasing competitive pressure as the supply of solar modules exceeds current demand. Our customers face significant challenges under the current economic conditions, including an increase in interest or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital to finance solar projects. Our net sales could be adversely impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in Europe, North America or Asia or if interest rates increase or financing is no longer available, which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects. In addition, subsidies for our customers, particularly in Germany, are declining at a rate that is greater than the annual contractual price decline we extend under our Long Term Supply Contracts. As result, we may be less competitive and not meet our customers internal rate of return (IRR) or the profit margin of our customers might decline, which could lower demand for our solar panels. Our sales prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts are denominated in euro, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 95% of our sales are denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and U.S. dollar. For example, the strengthening of the euro during 2008 increased our net sales by 6% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. In April 2006, we entered into long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six European solar power system project developers and system integrators, and in 2007, we entered into additional long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six other European project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects. In 2008, we entered into long term contracts with three European project developers, system integrators and operators and increased our contracted volume with four customers. We also entered into a five year agreement with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the United States, which is a related party. These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2009 through 2013, and therefore, will significantly affect our overall financial performance. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2006 require us to deliver solar modules each year that, in total, meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year. Under these Long Term Supply Contracts, we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5% annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3% for modules delivered in 2012. If we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year, we will be in breach of the applicable agreements, entitling our customers to certain remedies, potentially including the right to terminate their Long Term Supply Contracts. Our Long Term Supply Contracts entered into in 2007 do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases 3 4% annually from 2008 to 2010/2011, and then remains fixed through 2012, and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module. As of December 27, 2008, all of our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 6.5% at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in 2012. Because the sales prices under our Long Term Supply Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit. Our Long Term Supply Contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately $5.8 billion (4.9 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of $1.15/1.00 and 0.2 billion denominated in USD) in sales from 2009 to 2013. During 2008, we amended a Long Term Supply Contract with one customer, which reduced the volume of solar modules delivered to such customer in 2008 and also reduced the volume of solar modules to be delivered over the remaining term of the agreement to such customer. During February 2009 we amended our Long Term Supply Contracts with two customers to accelerate the decline in the sales price per watt under such contracts in 2009 and 30 Table of Contents 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under such contracts. We are currently in discussions with several other customers about making similar amendments to their Long Term Supply Contracts. The annual decline in the sales price under our Long Term Supply Contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 5 6% each year, assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat, and will impact our cash flow accordingly. As a result, our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease. Under our customer contracts, starting in April 2006, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Under our customer contracts in effect prior to April 1, 2006, we did not transfer title or risk of loss, or recognize revenue, until the solar modules were received by our customers. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. We have the right to terminate certain Long Term Supply Contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred, including, depending on the contract one or more of the following: new laws, rules or regulations with respect to our production, distribution, installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business; unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread, persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels; or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor, materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput. The average termination fee under those agreements is $4.2 million ranging from $0.7 million to $8.0 million. Our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the Long Term Supply Contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the case of a late delivery, certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, we began accounting for a portion of our revenues using the percent of completion method of accounting. Revenues for our solar power systems and project development business for the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 were $53.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and were not material to our consolidated results of operations. During 2008, our principal customers were Blitzstrom GmbH, Colexon Energy AG (previously Reinecke + Pohl), Conergy AG, Juwi Solar GmbH and Phoenix Solar AG. During 2008, each of these five customers individually accounted for between 11% and 19% of our net sales. All of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10% of our net sales during 2008. Cost of sales Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components, such as tempered back glass, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated front glass, cadmium telluride, laminate, connector assemblies, laminate edge seal and others. Other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety expenses, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and solar module end of life collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales. We implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our collection and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials. In return, the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our end of life collection and recycling 31 Table of Contents program or another program that we approve of, and the solar power system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future end of life collection and recycling obligation. We subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation, which we classify with selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per line, geographic diversification into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials we have procured for customer projects. We recognize these costs as deferred assets until we install the materials. Deferred project costs were $0.7 million at December 27, 2008. Gross profit Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines 6.5% at the beginning of each year. Another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached. As a result, gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. We continually add equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense. We may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the Ohio expansion to research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes. We maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the United States Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. During the past four years, we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs. We received $0.9 million, $1.8 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the 32 Table of Contents selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. Production start up expenses during 2006 were $11.7 million due to the qualification of our Ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of our German plant. We incurred production start up expense of $16.9 million during 2007 in connection with the qualification of the German plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. Production start up expense during 2008 was $32.5 million relating to the planning and preparation of our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center. In general, we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. We also expect to incur production start up expenses during 2009 related to our expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility and plant four at the Malaysian manufacturing center. Over time, we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Interest income Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, is incurred on various debt financings. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are further described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 27, 2008 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are as follows: Revenue recognition. We sell our products directly to solar power system integrators and operators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. This policy is in accordance with the requirements of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SAB 104, Revision of Topic 13 (Revenue Recognition). Under this policy, we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the sales contract. We do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products. With our acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC on November 30, 2007, a portion of our revenues will be derived from long term contracts that we account for under the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No. (SOP) 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and 33 Table of Contents Certain Production Type Contracts. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on long term fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition. If we identify any losses on contracts, we will recognize those losses immediately. Contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks, estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Furthermore, contract change orders, claims and similar items, require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization. We only include contract change orders, claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable. Incurred costs include all direct material, labor, subcontractor cost, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies and tools. We recognize job material costs as incurred costs when the job materials have been installed. When contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation, using the percentage of completion method of accounting. We consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design. Our liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, which is part of the balance sheet caption Other current liabilities, was $2.2 million and $2.1 million as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively. This liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts, which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies. We also have a limited number of revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables. These are contracts under which we provide design and consulting services for and we supply parts and equipment for solar power systems. We follow the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, in order to determine whether these arrangements have more than one unit of accounting. According to EITF 00 21, deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer, if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available, and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items. We determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar power system parts and equipment. We apply the same revenue recognition principles (from SAB 104) as we use for our arrangements for the stand alone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with SOP 81 1. End of life collection and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold. We base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation site to a recycling center, the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. We base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled. In the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. At December 27, 2008, our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was $35.2 million. A 10 percent decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by $3.5 million, to $31.7 million; a 10 percent increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by $3.5 million, to $38.7 million. Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules. We also warrant to the 34 Table of Contents owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years. Our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. During the years ended December 30, 2006, December 29, 2007 and December 27, 2008, our estimate of our product warranty liability did not require significant adjustments. Share based compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards on their grant dates. We adopted SFAS 123(R) during the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2005 using the modified retrospective method of transition. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 107, which provides guidance regarding the implementation of SFAS 123(R). In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in share based compensation valuation models, the classification of share based compensation expense, the capitalization of share based compensation costs and disclosures in managements discussion and analysis in filings with the SEC. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant using that valuation model requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes Merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options, which is consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes Merton formula, require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return. Because our stock has only recently become publicly traded, we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility; therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data to refer to from our own traded share price. We estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding. If we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for future share based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards, even if the critical terms of the awards are similar. Higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which we expect to vest. Quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates and further adjustments when the awards actually vest can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation. Increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters. Decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters. These adjustments affect our cost of sales, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative and production start up expenses. The adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments as certain awards completed their vesting period reduced our share based compensation expense by $0.6 million in the year ended December 30, 2006 and increased our share based compensation expense by $2.9 million and $0.9 million in the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 27, 2008, respectively. The expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of share based awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments when the awards actually vest. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. Our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities. Our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules. We account for any impairment of our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result, we assess long lived assets 35 Table of Contents classified as held and used, including our property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable. These events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses, significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. We evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 and did not note any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable. Accounting for Income Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate. We establish liabilities for potential losses that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Once established, we adjust the liabilities when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net non current amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We do not amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and, if necessary, we would record any impairment in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach methodology of valuation, which considers values of comparable businesses, to determine the fair value of our goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach. We reported $33.8 million of goodwill at December 27, 2008, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from Turner Renewable Energy, LLC. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 27, 2008 and concluded 36 Table of Contents that it was not impaired. Testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps. The first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed. That step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities. Any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill, and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss. In our test during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the fair value of our solar power systems reporting unit, which contains all of our goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by approximately 80 percent. As a result, we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable. Marketable Securities. We have classified our marketable securities as available for sale and present them at fair value on our balance sheet, with gains and losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. We determine the realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities using the specific identification cost method. All of our available for sale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. We consider our marketable debt securities impaired when their fair value is less than their carrying value. We subject investments identified as being impaired to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we would write down the investment to its impaired value and establish that amount as its new cost basis. We measure the fair value of our marketable securities using quoted prices for securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs (such as interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals) and we consider the effect of our counterparties credit standings in these fair value measurements. Determining the observable market values most relevant to the measurement of the fair value of marketable securities and the further counterparty credit risk adjustment to those values, if needed, requires significant judgment. Changes in market conditions can also significantly affect the fair value measurements from period to period and can cause realized values to vary significantly from previous estimates. Valuation of Derivative Instruments. We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk; we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We believe that there are two aspects of accounting for our derivative instruments that require us to make significant estimates and judgments: measuring the fair values of the derivative instruments and applying special hedge accounting rules to some of them. We report our derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information about how we measure the fair values of our derivative instruments. We believe that the types of derivative instruments that we use are commonly used by many companies outside the financial services industry and have well established valuation models, which we apply. Also, we believe that there are readily available, reliable sources for the information that we need as inputs to these valuation models. However, the selection of the valuation models and the inputs we use in them still does require us to exercise significant judgment about their relevance to our measurement, any adjustments that they may require to properly measure our particular derivative instruments and their reliability. We also note that the amounts that we use as valuation model inputs can change significantly from one period to another as markets fluctuate. This can cause the fair value that we estimate for any specific derivative instrument to vary significantly from one period to another. We designate some of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges pursuant to SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Under cash flow hedge accounting, we record the portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument that offsets, within a specified range, the change in the fair value of the specified future cash flow that it hedges as a component of other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flow affects the computation of our current income. At that time, we reclassify this effective portion of the net change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to current income. Among other things, cash flow hedge accounting requires us to test each hedging derivative instrument at the inception of the hedging relationship and at the end of each reporting period thereafter for its effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow. If we determine that the overall hedging relationship is 37 Table of Contents ineffective, we must discontinue cash flow hedge accounting for the derivative instrument and record all its future fair value changes in current income. SFAS 133 also requires us to measure any portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument that is not effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow and record that measured ineffectiveness in our current income. Because of these requirements, our estimates and judgments that affect the amounts that we measure for the fair value of our derivative instruments, and the hedged cash flows, can also have a significant impact on how we present changes in those fair values in our financial statements (current income versus other comprehensive income). Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006: Years Ended December 27, December 29, December 30, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 45.6 % 50.1 % 59.8 % Gross profit 54.4 % 49.9 % 40.2 % Research and development 2.7 % 3.0 % 4.7 % Selling, general and administrative 14.0 % 16.4 % 24.7 % Production start up 2.6 % 3.3 % 8.7 % Operating income 35.1 % 27.2 % 2.1 % Foreign currency gain (loss) 0.5 % 0.4 % 4.1 % Interest income 1.7 % 4.1 % 2.0 % Interest expense, net 0.0 % (0.5 )% (0.8 )% Other income (expense), net (0.1 )% (0.3 )% (0.6 )% Income tax expense (benefit) 9.3 % (0.5 )% 3.9 % Net income 27.9 % 31.4 % 2.9 % Fiscal Years Ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 1,246,301 $ 503,976 $ 742,325 147 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 148% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold during 2008 compared with 2007 due to strong demand for our solar modules in Europe. The increase in MW volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of our German plant, commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 4% during 2008 compared with 2007. Our average selling price decreased by approximately 1% during 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to a 6.5% contractual price decline, partially offset by a 6% increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Approximately 74% of our net sales during 2008 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. 38 Table of Contents Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 567,908 $ 252,573 $ 315,335 125 % % of net sales 45.6 % 50.1 % The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes, which resulted from the full production ramp of our German facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. These factors caused a $191.1 million increase in direct material expense, a $13.8 million increase in warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules, a $9.4 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a $101.0 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs. The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $40.5 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses, including a $2.4 million increase in share based compensation expense, a $30.7 million increase in facility and related expenses and a $29.8 million increase in depreciation expense, in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our German and Malaysian expansions. Our cost of sales during 2008 reflects a benefit of $2.0 million resulting from a change in the estimated amount of our warranty obligation. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 678,393 $ 251,403 $ 426,990 170 % % of net sales 54.4 % 49.9 % As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 4.5 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our German and Malaysian expansions, which drove a 148% increase in the number of megawatts sold. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased by 9% during 2008, while our average selling prices decreased by 1%. During 2008, foreign exchange gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed approximately 1.9% and 5.6%, respectively, to our gross profit, partially offset by a 3.0% decline in our average selling prices. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 33,517 $ 15,107 $ 18,410 122 % % of net sales 2.7 % 3.0 % The increase in our research and development expense was due to a $13.7 million increase in personnel related expense, including a $1.2 million increase in share based compensation expense, due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. In addition, consulting and other expenses increased by $3.8 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million during 2008 compared with 2007. Throughout 2008, we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 174,039 $ 82,248 $ 91,791 112 % % of net sales 14.0 % 16.4 % 39 Table of Contents The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was due to a $62.0 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses, including a $15.5 million increase in share based compensation. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $13.0 million and other expenses increased by $16.8 million during 2008. The increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our solar power system and project development business as well as operating a global manufacturing business. Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 32,498 $ 16,867 $ 15,631 93 % % of net sales 2.6 % 3.3 % During 2008, we incurred $32.5 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and Malaysian manufacturing expansion, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $16.9 million of production start up expenses for our German and Malaysian plant expansions during 2007. Production start up expenses are primarily the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Foreign exchange gain Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain $ 5,722 $ 1,881 $ 3,841 204 % Foreign exchange gain increased by $3.8 million during 2008 due to a substantial increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and high volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, in particular the euro. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 21,158 $ 20,413 $ 745 4 % Interest income remained relatively flat primarily as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2008, offset by a decline in interest rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 509 $ 2,294 $ (1,785 ) (78 )% Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized due to the construction of our Malaysian manufacturing center. Other expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other expense, net $ 934 $ 1,219 $ (285 ) (23 )% 40 Table of Contents Other expense, net consisted mainly of financing fees related to our credit facilities. During 2008, other expense was reduced by a mark to market gain of $0.6 million associated with our credit default swap. Income tax expense (benefit) Years Ended Year Over 2008 2007 Year Change (Dollars in thousands)} Income tax expense (benefit) $ 115,446 $ (2,392 ) $ 117,838 N.M. Effective tax rate 24.9 % (1.5 %) Income tax expense increased by $117.8 million, primarily due to the increase in pre tax income of $307.8 million, as well as the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2007 of $54.9 million. Our Malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of 16.5 years, which was originally scheduled to commence on January 1, 2009, which generally provides for a 100% exemption from Malaysian income tax. Subsequent to year end we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year. Due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of 2008, we concluded that the financial impact will be reflected in our first quarter of 2009 financial results. As a result we will recognize an income tax benefit of $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2009. Had the exemption from Malaysian tax against our 2008 income been granted during 2008, our 2008 income tax expense would have been reduced by $11.6 million to $103.8 million. The effective tax rate would have been 22.4% rather than 24.9%. Fiscal Years Ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 Net sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Net sales $ 503,976 $ 134,974 $ 369,002 273 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 259% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold in 2007 compared to 2006. We were able to increase the MW volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of the production ramp at our German plant, the full production of our Ohio expansion and continued improvements to our overall process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 11% in 2007 compared with 2006. Our average selling price increased by 4% during 2007 compared with 2006, mainly due to a 9% increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, partially offset by a 5% annual contractual price decline. Approximately 91% of our net sales in 2007 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Cost of sales $ 252,573 $ 80,730 $ 171,843 213 % % of net sales 50.1 % 59.8 % Direct material expense increased by $87.3 million, warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased by $9.1 million, sales freight and other costs increased by $3.2 million, in each case, primarily as a result of higher production volumes in 2007 compared with 2006. In addition, manufacturing overhead costs increased by $72.2 million, which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $43.0 million, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $4.2 million in 2006 to $9.5 million in 2007, resulting from the infrastructure associated with our Ohio expansion and German plant build out, facility and related expenses of $16.0 million and depreciation expense of $13.2 million, primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our Ohio and German plants. 41 Table of Contents Gross profit Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 251,403 $ 54,244 $ 197,159 363 % % of net sales 49.9 % 40.2 % As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 9.7 percentage points from 2006 to 2007, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our plant expansions, which drove a 259% increase in the number of megawatts sold. During 2007, foreign exchange gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed 3.0% and 9.8%, respectively, to our gross profit, partially offset by a 3.1% annual contractual price decline. Additionally, we incurred $7.6 million of costs, or 1.5% of revenues, associated with the ramp of our German plant in 2007, compared with $1.1 million of costs, or 0.8% of revenues, incurred in 2006 related to the ramp of our Ohio expansion. Research and development Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 15,107 $ 6,361 $ 8,746 137 % % of net sales 3.0 % 4.7 % The increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a $7.9 million increase in personnel related expense, including an increase in share based compensation expense from $2.3 million in 2006 to $4.7 million in 2007, due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. Consulting and other expenses also increased by $1.7 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 82,248 $ 33,348 $ 48,900 147 % % of net sales 16.4 % 24.7 % Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of $36.1 million, due to increased headcount and an increase in share based compensation from $5.3 million in 2006 to $23.4 million in 2007. In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $11.3 million and other expenses increased by $1.5 million during 2007, primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company and infrastructure build out to support our growth. Production start up Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Production start up $ 16,867 $ 11,725 $ 5,142 44 % % of net sales 3.3 % 8.7 % In 2007, we incurred $16.9 million of production start up expenses related to our German and Malaysia expansions, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $11.7 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and German plant expansions during 2006. Production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the line, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. 42 Table of Contents Foreign exchange gain Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Foreign exchange gain $ 1,881 $ 5,544 $ (3,663 ) N.M. Foreign exchange gain decreased by $3.7 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of hedging the foreign exchange exposure in 2007 to mitigate some of the impact on the fluctuating dollar. Interest income Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 20,413 $ 2,648 $ 17,765 N.M. The increase in interest income of $17.8 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances throughout 2007. We completed an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of $302.7 million and an equity follow on public offering in the third quarter of 2007, which provided us with net proceeds of $366.0 million. We also had higher investments in 2007 compared to 2006 that generated interest at higher rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense, net $ 2,294 $ 1,023 $ 1,271 124 % Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased by $1.3 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our German plant financing. In 2007, we capitalized $3.8 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to $3.3 million in 2006. Other expense Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Other expense $ 1,219 $ 799 $ 420 N.M. The increase in other expense of $0.4 million was primarily due to increased financing fees related to the IKB loans. Income tax expense (benefit) Years Ended Year Over 2007 2006 Year Change (Dollars in thousands) Income tax expense (benefit) $ (2,392 ) $ 5,206 $ (7,598 ) N.M. Our 2007 tax rate was a benefit of 1.5% which primarily reflects the net of a tax rate of 33.7% and a rate benefit of 35.2% due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of $54.9 million. The reversal was based upon our updated assessment of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets. The available positive evidence during fiscal 2007 included cumulative taxable income for the previous twelve quarters and a projection of future taxable income. The income tax expense for 2006 was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation, profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 27, 2008, we had $821.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared with $669.7 million as of December 29, 2007. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, government grants and low interest debt financings for our German and Malaysian plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan. As a result, we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future, which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. See Item 1A: Risk Factors Our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a cost effective manner, both of which are subject risks and uncertainties. The recent and unprecedented disruption in the current credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. As of December 27, 2008, our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. However, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. Cash Flows Cash provided (used) was as follows for the twelve months ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006 (in thousands): Years Ended 2008 2007 2006 Operating activities $ 463,067 $ 205,951 $ (576 ) Investing activities (308,441 ) (547,250 ) (159,994 ) Financing activities 177,549 430,421 451,550 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows (20,221 ) 7,050 391 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 311,954 $ 96,172 $ 291,371 Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $463.1 million during 2008 compared with $206.0 million during 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses in this period as well as the impact of non cash items that were recorded on the statements of income, primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation expense, offset by investments in accounts receivable and inventories to support growth. Our inventories increased by $84.8 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in raw materials and work in process as a result of revenue growth. Income taxes paid, net of refunds during 2008 were $2.0 million. Cash received from customers increased to $1,203.8 million during 2008 from $516.0 million during 2007 primarily due to an increase in net sales. Our net sales increased from $504.0 million during 2007 to $1,246.3 million in 2008. This increase was partially offset by cash paid to suppliers and employees of $723.1 million during 2008 compared with cash paid to suppliers and associates of $276.5 million during 2007, mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion. Cash provided by operating activities was $206.0 million during 2007 compared to cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million during 2006. Cash provided by interest earned increased to $20.0 million during 2007 from $2.6 million during 2006 mainly due to the increased cash from the initial public offering and the follow on offering. Cash received from customers increased to $516.0 million during 2007 from $110.2 million during 2006 mainly due to an increase in net sales and shorter payment terms. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees of $276.5 million compared to cash paid to suppliers and employees of 44 Table of Contents $111.9 million during 2006, mainly due to an increase in raw materials, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion. Also, we paid cash of $19.0 million for income taxes during 2007. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $308.4 million during 2008 compared with $547.3 million during 2007. Cash used in investing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from capital expenditures of $459.3 million, an equity investment of $25.0 million and an increase of $15.5 million in restricted accounts, offset by the net sale of marketable securities of $191.4 million. During 2008, we placed $15.5 million of cash in restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program and in October 2008, we made an equity investment of $25.0 million in a U.S based company that will supply solar power plants to residential and commercial customers. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to our investments related to the construction of our new plants in Malaysia and Germany. We expect to spend approximately $300.0 million in capital expenditures for 2009 mainly related to the build out of our Malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio plant. A majority of our capital expenditures for 2009 will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Cash used in investing activities was $547.3 million during 2007 compared with $160.0 million during 2006. Cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from capital expenditures of $242.4 million during 2007 and $153.2 million during 2006 and the net purchase of marketable securities of $293.4 million during 2007. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to our investments related to the construction of our new plants in Germany and Malaysia. Our cash outlays for the German plant were partially recovered through the receipt of $9.5 million and $16.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, of economic development funding from various German governmental entities, which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities. Cash paid for the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, net of cash acquired during 2007 was $5.5 million. During 2007 and 2006, we deposited $6.0 million and $6.8 million of cash into restricted accounts to fund our solar module collection and recycling program. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities was $177.5 million during 2008 compared with $430.4 million during 2007. Cash provided by financing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from investment incentives related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany of $35.7 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of issuance costs, of $138.9 million related to the equipment export financing agreement for our Malaysian manufacturing center. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these credit facilities. These cash proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of long term debt of $41.7 million during 2008. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2008 were $16.0 million mainly due to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2007 were $376.1 million mainly due to the receipt of $366.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $10.2 million of proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options. Excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements during 2008 were $28.7 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $430.4 million during 2007 compared with $451.6 million during 2006. During 2007 we received $366.0 million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $49.4 million from additional draws under debt facilities. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $10.2 million. Tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options during 2007 were $30.2 million. In addition, we received $9.5 million in economic development funding from various German governmental entities related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany. These receipts were partially offset by $34.8 million in net repayments of long term debt. During 2006, we received $302.7 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock, $130.8 million in net proceeds from debt issued to third parties, $36.0 million in loans from related parties, equity contributions from our sole owner prior to our IPO of $30.0 million and receipt of $16.8 million of economic development funding from various German governmental 45 Table of Contents entities. Partially offsetting these cash receipts was the repayment of $64.7 million of loans from related parties. On February 22, 2006, we issued $74.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2011 to Goldman, Sachs Co. On May 10, 2006, we extinguished these notes by payment of 4,261,457 shares of our common stock. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar power system projects for utilities in the United States. We have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business. This business sells solar power systems directly to system owners. These systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties. We also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the United States, such as the system design, engineering, procurement of permits and balance of system components, construction management, monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery. This acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in North America for solar electricity solutions to utility companies. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million); consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). On October 24, 2006, we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.001 and up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.001. These amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers, preferences, and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue. On October 30, 2006, our board of directors approved a 4.85 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares, which was effective November 1, 2006; the par value of our common shares remained $0.001 per share, and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 27, 2008, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements.

In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, we have recorded $7.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. 46 Table of Contents Debt and Credit Sources On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion at our Malaysian manufacturing center, First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (FS Malaysia), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary entered into an export financing facility agreement (Facility Agreement) with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) as arranger NATIXIS Zweigniederlassung Deutschland (NZD) as facility agent and original lender, AKA Ausfuhrkredit Gesellschaft mbH (AKA), as original lender and NATIXIS Labuan Branch (NLB) as security agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement, the lenders will furnish up to 134.0 million ($187.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) of credit facilities consisting of the following: (1) Five fixed rate euro denominated term loan facilities, which have the following maximum aggregate amounts: a) 16.9 million ($23.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); b) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); c) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); d) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); e) 1.2 million ($1.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); and (2) Five floating rate euro denominated term loan facilities, which have the following maximum aggregate amounts: a) 16.9 million ($23.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); b) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); c) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); d) 16.3 million ($22.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); and e) 1.2 million ($1.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). The loans under the fixed rate credit facilities will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at an annual rate of 4.54%. The loans under the floating rate credit facilities will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at Euribor plus a margin of 0.55%. These credit facilities are intended to be used by FS Malaysia for the purpose of (1) partially financing the purchase of certain equipment to be used at our Malaysian manufacturing center and (2) financing fees to be paid to Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs AG (Euler Hermes), the German Export Credit Agency of Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany, which will guaranty 95% of FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement (Hermes Guaranty). In addition, FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar, Inc., pursuant to a guaranty agreement described below. The Facility Agreement requires FS Malaysia to make 14 equal semi annual repayments of the total principal borrowed under each of the credit facilities listed above. The first of these repayments commences on the earlier of (1) the day that is nine months after the date that the Malaysian manufacturing center plant to which the credit facility relates becomes ready for operation and (2) a date specified for each credit facility, the earliest of which is 47 Table of Contents September 30, 2008 for the credit facilities listed as (1) a) and (2) a) above. Principal repayments commenced on September 30, 2008. FS Malaysia may voluntarily cancel commitments under the credit facilities and may make prepayments of amounts outstanding, in whole or in part, subject to minimum prepayment requirements and the payment of break costs. Subject to a limited exception, in the event that the Euler Hermes Guaranty is (1) fully or partially withdrawn, or otherwise ceases to be in full force and effect or (2) repudiated by Euler Hermes (or its intention to repudiate is evidenced in writing), or if any of the obligations of Euler Hermes under the Euler Hermes Guaranty ceases to be legal, valid, binding or in full force and effect, the loans made by any lender under any of the credit facilities may, at the direction of the lender, be declared immediately due and payable. FS Malaysia is obligated to pay commitment fees at an annual rate of 0.375% on the unused portions of the fixed rate credit facilities and at an annual rate of 0.350% on the unused portions of the floating rate credit facilities. In addition, FS Malaysia is obligated to pay certain underwriting, management and agency fees in connection with the credit facilities. In connection with the Facility Agreement, First Solar, Inc. entered into a first demand guaranty agreement dated May 6, 2008 in favor of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Facility Agreement. As stated above, FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement are guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by First Solar pursuant to this guaranty agreement. In connection with the Facility Agreement, all of FS Malaysias obligations related to the Facility Agreement are secured by a first party, first legal charge over the equipment financed by the credit facilities and the other documents, contracts and agreements related to that equipment. Also in connection with the Facility Agreement, any payment claims of First Solar, Inc. against FS Malaysia are subordinated to the claims of IKB, NZD, NLB and the other lenders under the Facility Agreement. The Facility Agreement contains various financial covenants with which we must comply, such as debt to equity ratios, total leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. We must submit these ratios related to the financial covenants for the first time at the end of fiscal 2009. The Facility Agreement also contains various customary non financial covenants with which FS Malaysia must comply, including, submitting various financial reports and business forecasts to the lenders, maintaining adequate insurance, complying with applicable laws and regulations and restricting on FS Malaysias ability to sell or encumber assets and make loan guarantees to third parties. We were in compliance with these covenants through December 27, 2008. As of December 27, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of 93.3 million ($130.6 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) under the Facility Agreement. On July 27, 2006, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Solar, Inc., entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG under which we could draw up to 102.0 million ($142.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) to fund costs of constructing and starting up our German plant. This credit facility consisted of a term loan of up to 53.0 million ($74.2 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) and a revolving credit facility of 27.0 million ($37.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). The facility also provided for a bridge loan, which we drew against to fund construction costs that were later reimbursed through funding from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant Act of 2005 (Investitionszulagen), of up to 22.0 million ($30.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). We can no longer make draw downs against the term loan and the bridge loan, and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until September 30, 2012. We incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling $2.2 million through December 29, 2007, which we recognized as interest and other financing expenses over the time that the borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. We did not incur any costs related to the credit facility during fiscal 2008. We also pay an annual commitment fee of 0.6% of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility. At December 27, 2008, we had outstanding borrowings of $55.0 million under the term loan, $42.0 million of which we classify as long term debt and $13.0 million of which we classify as the current portion of long term debt. We had no outstanding borrowings under the bridge loan at December 27, 2008. We repaid the bridge loan in 48 Table of Contents February 2008 with funding we received from the Federal Republic of Germany under the Investment Grant of 2005 and we cannot make any more draws against the bridge loan facility. We also had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 27, 2008. At December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, interest rates were 6.7% and 6.3%, respectively, for the term loan; however, on January 1, 2009, the interest rate reset to 4.6%. We must repay the term loan in twenty quarterly payments beginning on March 31, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2012. Once repaid, we may not draw again against the term loan facility. The revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by December 31, 2012. In certain circumstances, we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments. We pay interest at the annual rate of the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor) plus 1.6% on the term loan and Euribor plus 1.8% on the revolving credit facility. Each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility, we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one, three, or six months. The credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps covering at least 75% of the balance outstanding under the term loan. The Federal Republic of Germany is guaranteeing 48% of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the State of Brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32%. We pay an annual fee, not to exceed 0.5 million ($0.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) for these guarantees. In addition, we must maintain a debt service reserve of 3.0 million ($4.2 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00) in a restricted investment account, which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility. Substantially all of our assets in Germany, including the German plant, have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees. The credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply. First Solar Manufacturing GmbHs cash flow available for debt service must be at least 1.1 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization may not exceed 3.0:1 from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008, 2.5:1 from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 and 1.5:1 from January 1, 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility. The credit facility also contains various non financial covenants with which we must comply. We must submit various financial reports, financial calculations and statistics, operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender. We must adequately insure our German operation, and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems. Also, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH cannot open any bank accounts (other than those required by the credit facility), sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business, make any loans or guarantees to third parties or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors. We were in compliance with these covenants through December 27, 2008. Our ability to withdraw cash from First Solar Manufacturing GmbH for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 1.3 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30% of the amount of its total assets. First Solar Manufacturing GmbH also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2% to First Solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products. Furthermore, we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, such as if all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received a $15.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, $11.7 million of which was outstanding at December 27, 2008. Interest is payable monthly at the annual rate of 2.25%; principal payments commenced on December 1, 2006 and end on July 1, 2015. Land and buildings at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $21.1 million at December 27, 2008 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. During the year ended December 25, 2004, we received a $5.0 million loan from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio, of which $1.5 million was outstanding at December 27, 2008. Interest is payable monthly at 49 Table of Contents annual rates starting at 0.25% during the first year the loan is outstanding, increasing to 1.25% during the second and third years, increasing to 2.25% during the fourth and fifth years and increasing to 3.25% for each subsequent year; principal payments commenced on January 1, 2007 and end on December 1, 2009. Machinery and equipment at our Ohio plant with a net book value of $7.7 million at December 27, 2008 have been pledged as collateral for this loan. Our debt financing agreements bear interest based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). Euribor is the primary interbank lending rate within the Euro zone, with maturities ranging from one week to one year. A disruption of the credit environment as currently experienced could negatively impact interbank lending and therefore negatively impact the Euribor rate. An increase in the Euribor rate would increase our cost of borrowing. On December 30, 2007, the beginning of our fiscal year 2008, we adopted SFAS 157. Our adoption of SFAS 157 was limited to our financial assets and financial liabilities, as permitted by FSP 157 2. We do not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that we recognize or disclose at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis. Our adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations, and our fair value models do not make material use of unobservable inputs. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our adoption of SFAS 157. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 27, 2008. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for 95% of our net sales during 2008 and 98.8% of our net sales during 2007; all of these international sales were denominated in euro. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. In the past, most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. For the year ended December 27, 2008, a 10% change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by $118.3 million. With the expansion of our manufacturing operations into Germany and the current expansion into Malaysia, many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction, cash flow and translation: Transaction Exposure: We have certain assets and liabilities, primarily receivables, investments, accounts payable (including inter company transactions) and debt that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. In certain circumstances, changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the effect of short term foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on these assets and liabilities. As of December 27, 2008, the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with U.S. dollars was 175.2 million ($245.3 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to sell euros for U.S. dollars was 123.0 million 50 Table of Contents ($172.2 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00); and the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Malaysian ringgit with U.S. dollars was MYR 148.0 million ($42.9 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $0.29/MYR1.00). As of December 27, 2008, the unrealized loss of these forward contracts was $0.8 million. These foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. These currency forward contracts hedge third party balance sheet exposure. If the U.S. dollar would have weakened by 10%, the adverse impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro and Malaysian ringgit would have been $7.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Cash Flow Exposure: We have forecasted future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments. Changes in the relevant entitys functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. We initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify it into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled. Most of our German plants operating expenses are denominated in euros, creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales. In addition, we purchased forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro. As of December 27, 2008, the total notional value of these forward contracts was 625.1 million ($875.1 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). Earnings Translation Exposure: Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations. These contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income, net. We do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future. In the past, currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by $20.2 million during 2008 and positively impacted our cash flows by $7.1 million during 2007. Although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we have increased risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system. Although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system. This could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. During 2006, we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks, which bears interest at Euribor plus 1.6%. As of December 27, 2008, we hedged our exposure to changes in Euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of 39.1 million ($54.7 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 27, 2008 of $1.40/1.00). 51 Table of Contents During May of 2008, we entered into a credit facility with IKB, Natixis, Natixis Labuan Branch and Ausfuhrkredit Gesellschaft mbH which is denominated in euro. The loans under fixed rate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 4.54%. The loans under the floating rate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at Euribor plus a margin of 0.55%. In addition, we invest some of our cash in debt securities, which exposes us to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the market value of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including money market funds, government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit. As of December 27, 2008, our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 1.6%, with a weighted average maturity of 6.1 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by approximately $0.9 million. The direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of December 27, 2008, all of our investments were in money market accounts, federal and foreign agency debt and corporate debt securities. Commodity and Component Risk We are exposed to price risks for the raw materials, components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules. Also, some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier. We endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers, a process which could take up to 12 months if successful, but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers. In some cases, we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components, but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our Long Term Supply Contracts with our customers. As a result, we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our modules. In addition, a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process. Since our selling price under our Long Term Supply Contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our Long Term Supply Contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their term, we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption. Credit Risk We have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable, interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments. We place cash, cash equivalents, investments, interest rate swap agreements and enter into derivative contracts with high quality financial institutions, and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty. We continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions. In addition, we have certain restricted investments that are exposed to credit risk. These consist primarily of restricted investments, which are held by a subsidiary of a financial services company to fund our estimated future product collection and recycling costs. As of December 27, 2008 our restricted investments with this financial services company were $25.8 million. In October 2008 we entered into credit default swaps (CDS) against the parent company of this financial services company to protect our investment from a significant pre defined credit event to our counter party. Under a CDS, a third party assumes for a fee, a portion of the credit risk related to the investment. The CDS we entered into provides protection for losses in the event of a pre defined credit event of the parent company of the financial services company up to $25.0 million. These CDS expire on March 20, 2009 and June 20, 2009, respectively. 52 Table of Contents
