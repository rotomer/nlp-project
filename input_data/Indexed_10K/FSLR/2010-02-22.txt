In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview We manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology, and we design, construct and sell photovoltaic (PV) solar power systems. In furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar energy and achieving price parity with conventional fossil fuel based peak electricity generation, we are continually focused on reducing PV system costs in three primary areas: module manufacturing, Balance of System (BoS) costs (consisting of costs of components of a solar power system other than the solar modules, including inverters, mounting hardware, grid interconnection equipment, wiring and other devices, and installation labor costs), and cost of capital. First, with respect to our module manufacturing costs, our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world, based on publicly available information. In 2009, our total average manufacturing costs were $0.87 per watt, which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. By continuing to improve conversion efficiency and line throughput, lower material cost and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. Second, by continuing to improve conversion efficiency, leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms, and accelerate installation time, we believe we can continue to make substantial reductions in BoS costs, which represent over half of all costs associated with a typical utility scale PV solar power system. Finally, we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position, including our balance sheet and credit profile, will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems, thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems, which incorporate our modules and technology. Page 35 We believe that combining our reliable, low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity, to accelerate the adoption of our technology in large scale systems and to further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity. On February 22, 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Prior to that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2009 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2009; all references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2008; and all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2007. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity As of December 26, 2009, we operated 23 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1228MW (based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants) at our manufacturing plants in Perrysburg, Ohio, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and Kulim, Malaysia. We expect to add an additional production line to our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility in 2010, resulting in a 53.4MW increase in manufacturing capacity (based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants). We expect to increase our manufacturing capacity to 34 production lines by 2012, with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1.8GW (based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants). Market Overview We project the global market for PV solar modules to have a 35% compound annual growth rate through 2012, increasing demand to approximately 12GW worldwide. We expect approximately 7.5GW of global demand in 2010. In addressing a growing global need for PV solar electricity, we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics, market requirements and distribution channels. In subsidized feed in tariff markets, such as Germany, we have historically sold most of solar modules to solar project developers, system integrators and independent power producers. In other markets, such as the United States, the demand for solar has been primarily driven by renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power. To meet the needs of these markets and enable balance of system cost reductions, we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide a low cost turn key utility scale PV system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility end users. By building a fully integrated systems business, we believe we are in position to expand our business in transitional, and eventually economically sustainable markets (in which subsidies or incentives are minimal), that are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, such as the United States, China, India and parts of Europe. In the long term, we plan on competing on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation. In 2009, the solar industry moved from a supply driven to a demand driven environment, with increasing competitive pressure as the photovoltaic industrys total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules exceeded demand for those products. We expect that the photovoltaic industrys total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules will continue to exceed demand in 2010. Our customers faced significant challenges under the prevailing economic conditions, including tight liquidity and extended cash realization cycles, weakened balance sheets, constrained working capital, a volatile pricing environment leading to deferred project equity investments, constrained project finance outside of Germany and capital preservation within U.S. utilities during the year. We extended our payment terms with certain customers from 10 days to 45 days from the date of invoice and reduced prices under our Long Term Contracts in response to the economic conditions. During the second half of 2009, German installation activity was stronger than in the first half of 2009, driven by a combination of anticipation of reduced 2010 German feed in tariffs, seasonal demand, customer participation in our rebate program and improving project finance, tax equity and corporate finance conditions. The first half of 2009 in comparison had been characterized by project and channel competition with aggressive crystalline silicon module pricing, deferred project equity investment based on anticipation of further reductions, project debt constraints and delays and construction financing delays. To the extent the challenging conditions mentioned above return as seasonal strength subsides, our results of operations could be adversely affected by declines in the selling prices of our modules, decreases in sales volumes of our modules and or increases in our solar module inventories. We expect that demand for our solar modules in Germany in the first half of 2010 will increase due to the uncertainty around the German subsidies. The German feed in tariffs are currently under review by the government and certain proposals under discussion would further reduce these tariffs in the second quarter and later dates in 2010. Page 36 In 2009, we continued to expand into certain key transition markets, such as the United States, within which affordable solar electricity solutions could be developed and ultimately evolve into economically sustainable markets. Our acquisition of the project development business of OptiSolar Inc. in April 2009 furthered our development of solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the United States that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements. In January 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from Edison Mission Groups solar project development pipeline consisting of utility scale solar projects located primarily on private land in California and the southwestern United States. In the PV module segment, we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and photovoltaic systems. Solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes, including reliability, module cost per watt and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the systems life. We are the lowest cost PV module manufacturer in the solar industry, based on publicly available information, as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from $1.23 during 2007 to $0.87 during 2009. This cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their LCOE. Our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology (which enables conversion efficiency improvements and permits a continuous highly automated industrial manufacturing process), our scale and our operational excellence. In addition, our modules use approximately 1% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. The cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules. The current spot market price of polysilicon of approximately between $55 and $63 per kilogram (Kg) enables us to remain one of the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry. However, the timing and rate of decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to pricing pressure for solar modules. Although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer, we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors, that a $10 per Kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease, respectively, our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately $0.07. Given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules, there are higher balance of system costs associated with systems using our modules. Thus, to compete effectively on the basis of LCOE our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules. Our cost reduction roadmap anticipates manufacturing cost per watt reductions for our modules of 10% per year. During the twelve months ended December 26, 2009, we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 19% from our cost per watt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. While our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes, there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. Any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in margin compression, a decline in average selling prices of our solar modules, erosion in our market share for modules, a decrease in the rate of revenue growth and or a decline in overall revenues. We have taken, and continue to take, several actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures, including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core markets to drive module volumes, continuously making progress along our cost reduction roadmap and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules. As we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets, we can offer value beyond the PV module, reduce our exposure to module only competition and provide comprehensive utility scale photovoltaic systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs. Thus, our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for, and manufacturing throughput of our solar modules. Finally, we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings, including EPC capabilities and operating and maintenance services, in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules. Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. Net Sales Components Business Currently, the majority of our net sales is generated from the sale of solar modules. We currently price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price. During 2009, we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers, system integrators and operators headquartered in Germany, France, Spain and Italy, which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell. Page 37 As of December 26, 2009, we had Long Term Supply Contracts for the sale of solar modules expiring at the end of 2012 with fourteen European solar power system project developers and system integrators. We also have an agreement expiring in 2013 with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the United States, which is a related party. These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2010 through 2012, and therefore, will significantly affect our overall financial performance. We have the right to terminate certain Long Term Supply Contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred. In addition, our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the Long Term Supply Contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the case of a late delivery, certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. Certain of our Long Term Supply Contracts require us to deliver solar modules that, in total, meet or exceed specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year or specify an annual decline in the sales price per watt under these contracts. As a result, our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease. Because the sales prices under our Long Term Supply Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit. Our sales prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts are denominated in euro, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the year ended December 26, 2009, 86% of our sales were denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and U.S. dollar. We have in the past amended pricing and other terms in our Long Term Supply Contracts in order to remain competitive, as described below, and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment. For example, during the three months ended March 28, 2009, we amended our Long Term Supply Contracts with certain customers to further reduce the sales price per watt under these contracts in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under the contracts. We also extended the payment terms for certain customers under these contracts from net 10 days to net 45 days to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in Malaysia. During the third quarter of 2009, we amended our Long Term Supply Contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provides a price rebate to certain of these customers for solar modules purchased from us. The intent of this program is to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core segments in Germany. The rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in Germany at the beginning of each quarter for the upcoming quarter. The rebate program is subject to periodic review, and we will adjust the rebate rate quarterly upward or downward as appropriate. The rebate period commenced during the third quarter of 2009 and terminates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. Customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program. We account for rebates as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules and therefore as a reduction in revenue. No rebates granted under this program can be claimed in cash, and all rebates will be applied to reduce outstanding accounts receivable balances. During the year ended December 26, 2009, we extended rebates to customers in the amount of 87.1 million ($128.9 million at an average exchange rate of $1.48/1.00). We also enter into one time module sale agreements with customers for specific projects. Under our customer contracts we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. During 2009, principal customers of our components business were Blitzstrom GmbH, EDF EN Development, Gehrlicher Solar AG, Juwi Solar GmbH, and Phoenix Solar AG. During 2009, each of these five customers individually accounted for between 10% and 19% of our component segments net sales. All of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10% of our component business net sales during the year ended December 26, 2009. Page 38 Systems Business Through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution, which includes project development, EPC services, O&M services and, when required, project finance. Net sales from our systems segment are comprised of the following types of transactions: Transaction Description Engineer and Procure (EP) Contract Design of a solar electricity generation system for a customer that uses our solar modules; includes the procurement of all other required balance of system (BOS) components from third party suppliers. Engineer, Procure and Construct (EPC) Contract Design and construction for a customer of a turnkey solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules; includes the procurement of all other BOS components from third party suppliers. Sale of Project Assets Sale of project assets to a customer at various stages of development. This generally includes a single project consisting of costs incurred for permits, land or land rights or power off take agreements. Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Agreement Typically a fixed priced long term services agreement. During the year ended December 26, 2009, net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the United States and Canada. Our systems business does not currently meet the quantitative criteria for disclosures as a separate reporting segment. On April 3, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar Inc. and we have integrated this business into our systems business. Net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors, including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards, economic incentives (such as European feed in tariffs or the federal investment tax credit in the United States) and other PV system demand drivers. For a given solar power project, we recognize revenue for our systems business either after execution of an EPC agreement with a third party, specifying the terms and conditions of the construction of the solar power plant; by applying the provisions for real estate accounting; by applying the percentage of completion method of accounting; or upon the sale of the complete system solution, as appropriate for the particular facts and circumstances related to the project and its sale. At any given point in time, aggregate contracted sales amounts with respect to the systems segment generally consist of the uncompleted portion of contracted projects where we have entered into a definitive EPC agreement with the customer. Cost of sales Components Business Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as tempered back glass, transparent conductive oxide coated front glass, cadmium telluride, laminate, connector assemblies, laminate edge seal, and other items. Our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety expenses, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales. Page 39 We implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our solar module collection and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to collect the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their useful life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used solar modules or recycled to recover some of the raw materials. In return, the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our module collection and recycling program or any other program that we might approve of. The owner is also responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future module collection and recycling obligation. We subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation, which we classify within selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per production line, continued geographic expansion into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Systems Business Within our systems business, project related costs include standard EPC costs (consisting primarily of balance of system costs for inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering costs, and installation labor costs), site specific costs, and development costs (including transmission upgrade costs, interconnection fees and permitting costs). As further described in Note 22. Segment Reporting, at the time when the revenue recognition criteria are met, we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business as net sales of our components business. Therefore, the related cost of sales will also be included within our components business. Deferred project costs represent capitalized costs related to the deferred revenue for project development or project construction activities sold to a third party typically under an EPC agreement, for which the revenue recognition criteria have not been met. We recognize these costs as we recognize the revenue for these projects. Deferred project costs at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were $36.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Gross profit Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. Gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures, and we have in the past and may in the future decide to amend our Long Term Supply Contracts, which specify our sales price per watt. Other factors impacting gross profits are the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached, the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses coupled with a geographic factor. Gross profit margin is affected by our systems business, which generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the pass through nature of certain balance of system components procured from third parties. Gross profit for our systems business excludes cost of sales for solar modules, that are included in the gross profit of our components business. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. We acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and PV systems using our modules. We maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the United States Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. We received $0.9 million and $1.8 million of grant funding during the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively, that we applied towards our research and development programs. We did not receive any grant funding during the year ended December 26, 2009. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Page 40 Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for an expanding public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. We incurred production start up expense of $16.9 million during the year ended December 29, 2007 in connection with the qualification of our German plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. We incurred production start up expense of $32.5 million during the year ended December 27, 2008 in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center. Production start up expense for the year ended December 26, 2009 was $13.9 million and related to plant four of our Malaysian manufacturing center and our Ohio plant expansion. In general, we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. Over time, we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. Interest income Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash and investments. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, is incurred on various debt financings. Income Tax Expense Income taxes are imposed on our income by the taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, principally the United States, Germany and Malaysia. The statutory federal tax rate in the United States is 35% while the tax rate in Germany and Malaysia is approximately 28.5% and 25%, respectively. In Malaysia we have been granted a long term tax holiday, pursuant to which substantially all our income earned in Malaysia is exempt from income tax. Page 41 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 26, 2009 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are as follows: Solar module collection and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives. We base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation sites to a recycling center, the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. We base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes, about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the timing of solar modules returns for recycling. In the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. At December 26, 2009, our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was $92.8 million. A 10% decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by $9.0 million, to $83.8 million; a 10% increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by $9.1 million, to $101.9 million. Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules. We also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years. Our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. Accounting for Income Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate. We establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Once established, we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. Page 42 We also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. We have concluded that all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the United States. If our intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes, additional taxes may be required to be accrued. See Note 18. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We do not amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and, if necessary, we would record any impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. We will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach of valuation, which considers values of comparable businesses, to determine the fair value of our goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach. We reported $286.5 million of goodwill at December 26, 2009, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from Turner Renewable Energy, LLC and OptiSolar Inc. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 26, 2009 and concluded that it was not impaired. Testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps. The first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed. That step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities. Any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill, and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss. The fair value of our goodwill substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007: Years Ended December 26, 2009 December 27, 2008 December 29, 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 49.4 % 45.6 % 50.1 % Gross profit 50.6 % 54.4 % 49.9 % Research and development 3.8 % 2.7 % 3.0 % Selling, general and administrative 13.2 % 14.0 % 16.4 % Production start up 0.7 % 2.6 % 3.3 % Operating income 32.9 % 35.1 % 27.2 % Foreign currency gain 0.3 % 0.5 % 0.4 % Interest income 0.5 % 1.7 % 4.1 % Interest expense, net (0.3 )% 0.0 % (0.5 )% Other expense, net (0.1 )% (0.1 )% (0.3 )% Income tax expense (benefit) 2.2 % 9.3 % (0.5 )% Net income 31.1 % 27.9 % 31.4 % Page 43 Fiscal Years Ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 Net sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Net sales $ 2,066,200 $ 1,246,301 $ 819,899 66 % The increase in our net sales was primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined, resulting in a 114% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold during 2009 compared with 2008, and from an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business, partially offset by a decrease in our module average selling price. Revenue recognized for our systems business during 2009 was $115.0 million and resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems to utilities in the United States and Canada. The increase in MW volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of all four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center, continued improvements to our manufacturing process and the growth in our systems business. In addition, we increased the average conversion efficiency by approximately 3% during 2009 compared with 2008. Our average selling price decreased by approximately 25% during 2009 compared with 2008. Approximately 20% of the decline in our average selling price was primarily due to competitive pressure, including the commencement of a customer rebate program in the third quarter of 2009. Additionally, our average selling price was adversely impacted by approximately 4% due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and by approximately 1% due to a shift in customer mix. During 2009 and 2008, 65% and 74%, respectively, of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Cost of sales $ 1,021,618 $ 567,908 $ 453,710 80 % % of net sales 49.4 % 45.6 % The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes, which resulted from the commencement of production at all of our four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center, production ramp of our Perrysburg, Ohio expansion, and an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business. The increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects: a $278.7 million increase in direct material expense (including an $8.2 million amortization of project assets acquired through our OptiSolar acquisition), a $41.0 million increase in warranty expense and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules due to increased sales, a $13.8 million increase in sales freight and other costs, and a $120.2 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs. The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $35.3 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses (including a $4.9 million increase in share based compensation expense), a $32.9 million increase in facility and related expenses and a $52.0 million increase in depreciation expense. Each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased infrastructure associated with the build out of our Malaysian manufacturing center and start up of our systems business. Our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by $0.21 per watt, or 19%, from $1.08 in 2008 to $0.87 in 2009 and included $0.01 of ramp penalty associated with the ramp and qualification of our Malaysian and Perrysburg manufacturing facilities and $0.01 of non cash stock based compensation. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Gross profit $ 1,044,582 $ 678,393 $ 366,189 54 % % of net sales 50.6 % 54.4 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 3.8% percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decline in our average selling prices by approximately 21%, partially offset by continued manufacturing cost per watt reduction of 19.4%. The decline in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro adversely impacted our gross profit by 2.2%. We expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses. Page 44 Research and development Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Research and development $ 78,161 $ 33,517 $ 44,644 133 % % of net sales 3.8 % 2.7 % The increase in our research and development expense was due to a $14.2 million increase in personnel related expense (including a $2.3 million increase in share based compensation expense) resulting from increased headcount. In addition, testing and qualification material costs increased by $18.0 million, consulting and other expenses increased by $11.5 million and grants received decreased by $0.9 million during 2009 compared with 2008. During fiscal 2009, we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and we increased the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3% in comparison to fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Selling, general and administrative $ 272,898 $ 174,039 $ 98,859 57 % % of net sales 13.2 % 14.0 % The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was due to a $66.0 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses (including a $23.0 million increase in share based compensation expense, of which, $15.7 million were one time charges associated with our executive management team). In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $13.3 million; and other expenses increased by $19.6 million and included $6.9 million of one time charges, of which, $5.5 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and operation of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar, which we acquired on April 3, 2009. Production start up Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Production start up $ 13,908 $ 32,498 $ (18,590 ) (57 )% % of net sales 0.7 % 2.6 % During 2009, we incurred $13.9 million of production start up expenses for our Malaysian and Perrysburg manufacturing expansions, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $32.5 million of production start up expenses for our Malaysian manufacturing expansion during 2008. Production start up expenses are comprised of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Page 45 Foreign currency gain Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Foreign currency gain $ 5,207 $ 5,722 $ (515 ) (9 )% Foreign currency gain decreased primarily due to a decrease in our net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Interest income Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Interest income $ 9,735 $ 21,158 $ (11,423 ) (54 )% Interest income decreased primarily due to a substantial decline in interest rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Interest expense, net $ 5,258 $ 509 $ 4,749 933 % Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased primarily due to lower amounts of interest expense capitalized during 2009. In addition, interest expense, net for 2009 includes a $2.4 million expense related to the termination of the interest rate swaps for our German debt facility. We fully repaid this facility on June 30, 2009. Other expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Other expense, net $ 2,985 $ 934 $ 2,051 220 % Other expense, net, increased primarily due to expenses associated with our credit default swaps, which expired in the second quarter of 2009. Page 46 Income tax expense Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Income tax expense $ 46,176 $ 115,446 $ (69,270 ) (60 )% Effective tax rate 6.7 % 24.9 % Income tax expense decreased primarily due to the effect of our tax holiday in Malaysia. During 2009, a significant amount of our pre tax income was generated in Malaysia where we have a 16.5 year tax holiday. In addition, we recognized an $11.5 million tax benefit during 2009 related to the reversal of 2008 Malaysian tax due to the pull forward of the tax holiday to 2008, which was granted in 2009. See also Note 18. Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Fiscal Years Ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 Net sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Net sales $ 1,246,301 $ 503,976 $ 742,325 147 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 148% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold during 2008 compared with 2007 due to strong demand for our solar modules in Europe. The increase in MW volume of solar modules sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our German plant, commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 4% during 2008 compared with 2007. Our average selling price decreased by approximately 1% during 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to a 6.5% contractual price decline, partially offset by a 6% increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Approximately 74% of our net sales during 2008 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Cost of sales $ 567,908 $ 252,573 $ 315,335 125 % % of net sales 45.6 % 50.1 % The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes, which resulted from the full production ramp of our German facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. These factors caused a $191.1 million increase in direct material expense, a $13.8 million increase in warranty and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules, a $9.4 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a $101.0 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs. The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $40.5 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses, including a $2.4 million increase in share based compensation expense, a $30.7 million increase in facility and related expenses and a $29.8 million increase in depreciation expense, in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our German and Malaysian expansions. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Gross profit $ 678,393 $ 251,403 $ 426,990 170 % % of net sales 54.4 % 49.9 % As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 4.5 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our German and Malaysian expansions, which drove a 148% increase in the number of megawatts sold. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased by 9% during 2008, while our average selling prices decreased by 1%. During 2008, foreign currency gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed approximately 1.9% and 5.6%, respectively, to our gross profit, partially offset by a 3.0% decline in our average selling prices. Page 47 Research and development Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Research and development $ 33,517 $ 15,107 $ 18,410 122 % % of net sales 2.7 % 3.0 % The increase in our research and development expense was due to a $13.7 million increase in personnel related expense (including a $1.2 million increase in share based compensation expense) due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. In addition, consulting and other expenses increased by $3.8 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million during 2008 compared with 2007. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Selling, general and administrative $ 174,039 $ 82,248 $ 91,791 112 % % of net sales 14.0 % 16.4 % The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was due to a $62.0 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses (including a $15.5 million increase in share based compensation). In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $13.0 million and other expenses increased by $16.8 million during 2008. The increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our solar power system and project development business as well as operating a global manufacturing business. Page 48 Production start up Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Production start up $ 32,498 $ 16,867 $ 15,631 93 % % of net sales 2.6 % 3.3 % During 2008, we incurred $32.5 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and Malaysian manufacturing expansion, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $16.9 million of production start up expenses for our German and Malaysian plant expansions during 2007. Production start up expenses are primarily the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Foreign currency gain Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Foreign currency gain $ 5,722 $ 1,881 $ 3,841 204 % Foreign exchange gain increased by $3.8 million during 2008 due to a substantial increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the high volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, in particular the euro. Interest income Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Interest income $ 21,158 $ 20,413 $ 745 4 % Interest income remained relatively flat primarily as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2008, offset by a decline in interest rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Interest expense, net $ 509 $ 2,294 $ (1,785 ) (78 )% Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized due to the construction of our Malaysian manufacturing center. Page 49 Other expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Other expense, net $ 934 $ 1,219 $ (285 ) (23 )% Other expense, net consisted mainly of financing fees related to our credit facilities. During 2008, other expense was reduced by a mark to market gain of $0.6 million associated with our credit default swap. Income tax expense (benefit) Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Income tax expense (benefit) $ 115,446 $ (2,392 ) $ 117,838 N.M. Effective tax rate 24.9 % (1.5 )% Income tax expense increased by $117.8 million, primarily due to the increase in pre tax income of $307.8 million, as well as the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2007 of $54.9 million. Our Malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of 16.5 years, which was originally scheduled to commence on January 1, 2009, which generally provides for a 100% exemption from Malaysian income tax. Subsequent to year end, we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year. Due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of 2008, we concluded that the financial impact should be reflected in our 2009 financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 26, 2009, we had $1,114.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared with $821.8 million as of December 27, 2008. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan. Our expanding systems business is expected to have increasing liquidity requirements in the future. Solar power project development cycles, which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a photovoltaic power plant project, vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature. As a result of these long project cycles, we may need to make significant up front investments of resources in advance of the signing of power purchase agreements and EPC contracts and the receipt of any revenue. We have historically financed these up front investments primarily using working capital and cash on hand. In the future, we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings. Such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. The unprecedented disruption in the credit markets over the past two years has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. As of December 26, 2009, our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. However, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. Page 50 Cash Flows The following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 (in thousands): Years Ended 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 675,193 $ 463,067 $ 205,951 Net cash used in investing activities (701,690 ) (308,441 ) (547,250 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (22,021 ) 177,549 430,421 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows (3,201 ) (20,221 ) 7,050 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (51,719 ) $ 311,954 $ 96,172 Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $675.2 million during 2009 compared with $463.1 million during 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in net income and the impact of non cash items that were recorded on our statements of operations, primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation expense, offset by an increase in operating assets, primarily accounts receivable and deferred project costs. Cash received from customers increased to $1,957.6 million during 2009 compared with $1,203.8 million during 2008, primarily due to an increase in net sales, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $122.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the amendment of certain of our customers Long Term Supply Contracts to extend their payment terms from net 10 days to net 45 days primarily to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in Malaysia and due to additional volume shipped during 2009. Our net sales increased from $1,246.3 million during 2008 to $2,066.2 million during 2009. Cash paid to suppliers and associates increased to $1,123.7 million during 2009 from $723.1 million during 2008, mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our growth. Inventory increased by $52.1 million, of which $32.2 million related to an increase in finished goods inventory as a result of inventory requirements for utility scale projects in North America. Income taxes paid, net of refunds during 2009, were $147.8 million compared to $2.0 million during 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was $463.1 million during 2008 compared with $206.0 million during 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses in this period as well as the impact of non cash items that were recorded on our statements of operations, primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation expense, offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support growth. Our inventories increased by $84.8 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in raw materials and work in process as a result of revenue growth. Cash received from customers increased to $1,203.8 million during 2008 from $516.0 million during 2007 primarily due to an increase in net sales. Our net sales increased from $504.0 million during 2007 to $1,246.3 million in 2008. This increase was partially offset by cash paid to suppliers and associates of $723.1 million during 2008 compared with cash paid to suppliers and associates of $276.5 million during 2007, mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion. Page 51 Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $701.7 million during 2009 compared with $308.4 million during 2008. Cash used in investing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the net purchase of marketable securities of $342.5 million, the net investment in notes receivable of $74.2 million to fund construction of various photovoltaic power generation facilities, capital expenditures of $279.9 million, and an increase of $4.2 million in restricted investments to fund our solar module collection and recycling program. Capital expenditures during 2009 related primarily to the expansion of our plant in Perrysburg, Ohio and completion of construction of our new plants in Malaysia. See Note 11. Notes Receivable to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the above referenced notes receivable. On April 3, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar Inc. The total consideration consisted of 2,972,420 shares of our common stock, of which 355,096 shares represented a contingent consideration. The total purchase price based on the closing price of our common stock on April 3, 2009 of $134.38 per share was $399.4 million. See also Note 3. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to spend up to $550.0 million in capital expenditures for 2010, including expenditures related to the eight line expansion of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. A majority of our capital expenditures for 2010 will be incurred in foreign currency; and therefore, are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. At the beginning of each fiscal year we pre fund our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs for solar modules that we sold during the prior fiscal year through a custodial account with a large bank as investment advisor, in the name of a trust, for which First Solar, Inc., First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd, and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. For this purpose we assume a minimum service life of 25 years for our solar modules. Prior to June 2009, we pre funded our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs through a financial services company. At December 26, 2009, we had $36.5 million in the new custodial account, which we classified in our restricted investments on our balance sheet. See Note 6. Restricted Cash and Investments to our consolidated financial statements for additional information Cash used in investing activities was $308.4 million during 2008 compared with $547.3 million during 2007. Cash used in investing activities during 2008 was primarily due to capital expenditures of $459.3 million related to the construction of our plants in Malaysia and Germany, an investment of $25.0 million in the preferred stock of a United States company that supplies solar power systems to commercial and residential customers and an increase in our restricted investments of $15.6 million to fund our solar module collection and recycling program, offset by the net sale of marketable securities of $191.4 million. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar power systems in the United States. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million); consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash. See also Note 3. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities was $22.0 million during 2009 compared with cash provided by financing activities of $177.5 million during 2008. Cash used in financing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the repayment of long term debt of $78.2 million, which was partially offset by (i) proceeds of $44.7 million from the issuance of debt, net of issuance cost, related to the equipment export financing agreement for our Malaysian manufacturing center, (ii) proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $6.0 million during 2009 mainly due to the exercise of employee stock options and, (iii) excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements of $4.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $177.5 million during 2008 compared with $430.4 million during 2007. Cash provided by financing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in investment incentives related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany of $35.7 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of issuance cost, of $138.9 million related to the equipment export facility agreement for our Malaysian manufacturing center. See Note 13. Debt to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these credit facilities. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of long term debt of $41.7 million in 2008. Excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements during 2008 were $28.7 million. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2007 were $376.1 million mainly due to the receipt of $366.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $10.2 million of proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options. Page 52 Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 26, 2009, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements. Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (1) $ 196,388 $ 35,895 $ 65,995 $ 62,586 $ 31,912 Capital lease obligations 2 2 Operating lease obligations 72,183 8,392 20,719 13,988 29,084 Purchase obligations (2) 416,373 161,106 229,469 17,518 8,280 Recycling obligations 92,799 92,799 Total $ 777,745 $ 205,395 $ 316,183 $ 94,092 $ 162,075 (1) Includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt. (2) Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed minimum, or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of transactions. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, we have recorded $37.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Debt and Credit Sources Revolving Credit Facility On September 4, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement among First Solar, Inc., certain designated Borrowing Subsidiaries (consisting of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a German subsidiary, and other subsidiaries of our Company who may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement) and several lenders. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America served as Joint Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners, with JPMorgan also acting as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides us and the borrowing subsidiaries with a senior secured three year revolving credit facility in an aggregate available amount of $300.0 million, a portion of which is available for letters of credit and swingline loans. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the facility up to $400.0 million. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we also entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements. At December 26, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $46.0 million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility, leaving approximately $254.0 million in capacity available under the revolving credit facility, $29.0 million of which may be used for letters of credit. As of this date, based on applicable indices, the all in effective three months LIBOR borrowing rate under the facility was 3.47%. See also Note 13. Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Page 53 Malaysian Facility Agreement On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion at our Malaysian manufacturing center, First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (FS Malaysia), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an export financing facility agreement (Malaysian Facility Agreement) with a consortium of banks. The total available loan amount was 134.0 million ($193.0 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00). Pursuant to the Malaysia Facility Agreement, we began semi annual repayments of the principal balances of these credit facilities during 2008. Amounts repaid under this credit facility cannot be re borrowed. At December 26, 2009, we had $168.3 million of borrowings outstanding, with no additional borrowing capacity available under this credit facility. See also Note 13. Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 26, 2009. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for 93% of our net sales during 2009 and 95% of our net sales during 2008; of which, 92% and 100% of these international sales, respectively, were denominated in euros. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. In the past, most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. For the year ended December 26, 2009, a 10% change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by $177.7 million. For our manufacturing operations in Germany and Malaysia, many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries are denominated in the local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction exposure, cash flow exposure and earnings translation exposure. Transaction Exposure: Many components of our business have assets and liabilities (primarily receivables, investments, accounts payable, debt, solar module collection and recycling liabilities and inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge assets and liabilities against the short term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. As of December 26, 2009, the total unrealized loss on our foreign exchange forward contracts was $6.8 million. These contracts have maturities of less than two months. Since our acquisition of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar on April 3, 2009, we have also become exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. Page 54 As of December 26, 2009, the total notional value of our foreign exchange forward contracts was as follows (notional amounts and U.S. dollar equivalents in millions): Transaction Currency Notional Amount U.S. Equivalent Balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 Purchase Euro 229.1 $329.9 $1.44/1.00 Sell Euro 109.9 $158.3 $1.44/1.00 Sell U.S. dollar for Euro $27.2 $27.2 n/a Purchase Malaysian ringgits MYR 104.5 $30.3 $0.29/MYR1.00 Sell Malaysian ringgits MYR 22.8 $6.6 $0.29/MYR1.00 Purchase Japanese yen JPY 275.0 $2.8 $0.01/JPY1.00 Sell Japanese yen JPY 70.0 $0.7 $0.01/JPY1.00 Purchase Canadian dollar CAD 108.4 $103.0 $0.95/CAD1.00 Sell Canadian dollar CAD 120.1 $114.1 $0.95/CAD1.00 If the U.S. dollar would have weakened by 10% against the euro, Malaysian ringgit, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen, the favorable impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro, Malaysian ringgit, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen would have been $0.5 million. Cash Flow Exposure: We expect many of the components of our business to have material future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, which will be denominated in currencies other than the components functional currency. Our primary cash flow exposures are future customer collections and vendor payments. Changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currency and the other currencies in which they transact business will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. We initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction is realized. Most of our German plants operating expenses are denominated in euros, creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales. In addition, we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro. As of December 26, 2009, the unrealized loss on these contracts was $15.9 million and the total notional value of the contracts was 361.0 million ($519.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00). The weighted average forward exchange rate for these contracts was $1.40/1.00 at December 26, 2009. Earnings Translation Exposure: Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations. These contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income, net. We do not hedge translation exposure at this time, but may do so in the future. In the past, currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by $3.2 million and $20.2 million in the years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. Although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Page 55 Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system. Although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is considered to be approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditures. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system. This could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. During 2006, we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks for the financing of our German plant, which bore interest at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) plus 1.6%. We had interest rate swap contracts with a financial institution that effectively converted to fixed rates the variable rate of Euribor on the term loan portion of this credit facility. These swap contracts were required under the credit facility agreement which we repaid and terminated on June 30, 2009. Therefore, we terminated these interest rate swap contracts on June 26, 2009 and consequently recognized interest expense of 1.7 million ($2.4 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00). The termination of the interest rate swap contracts settled on June 30, 2009. During May 2008, we entered into a euro denominated credit facility to finance some of the equipment cost for our Malaysian manufacturing center. The loans under the fixed rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 4.54%. The loans under the floating rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at Euribor plus a margin of 0.55%. On May 29, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of 57.3 million ($82.5 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00) to receive a six month floating interest rate, equal to Euribor, and pay a fixed rate of 2.80%. This contract became effective on September 30, 2009. The notional amount of the interest rate swap contract is scheduled to decline in correspondence to our scheduled principal payments on the underlying hedged debt. In addition, we invest in debt securities, which exposes us to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the market value of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including money market mutual funds, government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit. As of December 26, 2009, our fixed income investments earned a pre tax yield of 1.08%, with a weighted average maturity of 7.2 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by $4.8 million. The direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of December 26, 2009, all of our investments were in money market mutual funds, federal and foreign agency debt, supranational debt, corporate debt securities, foreign government obligations and asset backed securities. Commodity and Component Risk We are exposed to price risks for the raw materials, components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules. Also, some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier. We endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers, a process which could take up to 12 months if successful, but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers. In some cases, we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components, but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our Long Term Supply Contracts with our customers. As a result, we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules. In addition, a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process. Since our selling price under our Long Term Supply Contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our Long Term Supply Contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their terms, we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption. Page 56 Credit Risk We have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable, interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments. We place cash, cash equivalents, investments, interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty. We continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions. 
 
Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as described under the Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, that appears earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview We manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology, and we design, construct and sell photovoltaic (PV) solar power systems. In furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar energy and achieving price parity with conventional fossil fuel based peak electricity generation, we are continually focused on reducing PV system costs in three primary areas: module manufacturing, Balance of System (BoS) costs (consisting of costs of components of a solar power system other than the solar modules, including inverters, mounting hardware, grid interconnection equipment, wiring and other devices, and installation labor costs), and cost of capital. First, with respect to our module manufacturing costs, our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world, based on publicly available information. In 2009, our total average manufacturing costs were $0.87 per watt, which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. By continuing to improve conversion efficiency and line throughput, lower material cost and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs, we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. Second, by continuing to improve conversion efficiency, leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms, and accelerate installation time, we believe we can continue to make substantial reductions in BoS costs, which represent over half of all costs associated with a typical utility scale PV solar power system. Finally, we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position, including our balance sheet and credit profile, will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems, thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems, which incorporate our modules and technology. Page 35 We believe that combining our reliable, low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity, to accelerate the adoption of our technology in large scale systems and to further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar electricity. On February 22, 2006, we were incorporated as a Delaware corporation. Prior to that date, we operated as a Delaware limited liability company. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday on or before December 31. All references to fiscal year 2009 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 26, 2009; all references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2008; and all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2007. We use a 13 week fiscal quarter. Manufacturing Capacity As of December 26, 2009, we operated 23 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1228MW (based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants) at our manufacturing plants in Perrysburg, Ohio, Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and Kulim, Malaysia. We expect to add an additional production line to our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing facility in 2010, resulting in a 53.4MW increase in manufacturing capacity (based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants). We expect to increase our manufacturing capacity to 34 production lines by 2012, with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1.8GW (based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants). Market Overview We project the global market for PV solar modules to have a 35% compound annual growth rate through 2012, increasing demand to approximately 12GW worldwide. We expect approximately 7.5GW of global demand in 2010. In addressing a growing global need for PV solar electricity, we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics, market requirements and distribution channels. In subsidized feed in tariff markets, such as Germany, we have historically sold most of solar modules to solar project developers, system integrators and independent power producers. In other markets, such as the United States, the demand for solar has been primarily driven by renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power. To meet the needs of these markets and enable balance of system cost reductions, we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide a low cost turn key utility scale PV system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility end users. By building a fully integrated systems business, we believe we are in position to expand our business in transitional, and eventually economically sustainable markets (in which subsidies or incentives are minimal), that are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, such as the United States, China, India and parts of Europe. In the long term, we plan on competing on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation. In 2009, the solar industry moved from a supply driven to a demand driven environment, with increasing competitive pressure as the photovoltaic industrys total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules exceeded demand for those products. We expect that the photovoltaic industrys total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules will continue to exceed demand in 2010. Our customers faced significant challenges under the prevailing economic conditions, including tight liquidity and extended cash realization cycles, weakened balance sheets, constrained working capital, a volatile pricing environment leading to deferred project equity investments, constrained project finance outside of Germany and capital preservation within U.S. utilities during the year. We extended our payment terms with certain customers from 10 days to 45 days from the date of invoice and reduced prices under our Long Term Contracts in response to the economic conditions. During the second half of 2009, German installation activity was stronger than in the first half of 2009, driven by a combination of anticipation of reduced 2010 German feed in tariffs, seasonal demand, customer participation in our rebate program and improving project finance, tax equity and corporate finance conditions. The first half of 2009 in comparison had been characterized by project and channel competition with aggressive crystalline silicon module pricing, deferred project equity investment based on anticipation of further reductions, project debt constraints and delays and construction financing delays. To the extent the challenging conditions mentioned above return as seasonal strength subsides, our results of operations could be adversely affected by declines in the selling prices of our modules, decreases in sales volumes of our modules and or increases in our solar module inventories. We expect that demand for our solar modules in Germany in the first half of 2010 will increase due to the uncertainty around the German subsidies. The German feed in tariffs are currently under review by the government and certain proposals under discussion would further reduce these tariffs in the second quarter and later dates in 2010. Page 36 In 2009, we continued to expand into certain key transition markets, such as the United States, within which affordable solar electricity solutions could be developed and ultimately evolve into economically sustainable markets. Our acquisition of the project development business of OptiSolar Inc. in April 2009 furthered our development of solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the United States that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements. In January 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from Edison Mission Groups solar project development pipeline consisting of utility scale solar projects located primarily on private land in California and the southwestern United States. In the PV module segment, we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and photovoltaic systems. Solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes, including reliability, module cost per watt and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the systems life. We are the lowest cost PV module manufacturer in the solar industry, based on publicly available information, as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from $1.23 during 2007 to $0.87 during 2009. This cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their LCOE. Our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology (which enables conversion efficiency improvements and permits a continuous highly automated industrial manufacturing process), our scale and our operational excellence. In addition, our modules use approximately 1% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. The cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules. The current spot market price of polysilicon of approximately between $55 and $63 per kilogram (Kg) enables us to remain one of the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry. However, the timing and rate of decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to pricing pressure for solar modules. Although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer, we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors, that a $10 per Kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease, respectively, our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately $0.07. Given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules, there are higher balance of system costs associated with systems using our modules. Thus, to compete effectively on the basis of LCOE our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules. Our cost reduction roadmap anticipates manufacturing cost per watt reductions for our modules of 10% per year. During the twelve months ended December 26, 2009, we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 19% from our cost per watt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. While our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes, there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. Any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in margin compression, a decline in average selling prices of our solar modules, erosion in our market share for modules, a decrease in the rate of revenue growth and or a decline in overall revenues. We have taken, and continue to take, several actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures, including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core markets to drive module volumes, continuously making progress along our cost reduction roadmap and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules. As we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets, we can offer value beyond the PV module, reduce our exposure to module only competition and provide comprehensive utility scale photovoltaic systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs. Thus, our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for, and manufacturing throughput of our solar modules. Finally, we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings, including EPC capabilities and operating and maintenance services, in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules. Financial Operations Overview The following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results. Net Sales Components Business Currently, the majority of our net sales is generated from the sale of solar modules. We currently price and sell our solar modules per watt of power. As a result, our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price. During 2009, we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers, system integrators and operators headquartered in Germany, France, Spain and Italy, which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell. Page 37 As of December 26, 2009, we had Long Term Supply Contracts for the sale of solar modules expiring at the end of 2012 with fourteen European solar power system project developers and system integrators. We also have an agreement expiring in 2013 with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the United States, which is a related party. These contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2010 through 2012, and therefore, will significantly affect our overall financial performance. We have the right to terminate certain Long Term Supply Contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred. In addition, our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume. These delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the Long Term Supply Contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers. In the case of a late delivery, certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue. If we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments, our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis. Certain of our Long Term Supply Contracts require us to deliver solar modules that, in total, meet or exceed specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year or specify an annual decline in the sales price per watt under these contracts. As a result, our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease. Because the sales prices under our Long Term Supply Contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year, we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers. Although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts, our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit. Our sales prices under the Long Term Supply Contracts are denominated in euro, exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the year ended December 26, 2009, 86% of our sales were denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and U.S. dollar. We have in the past amended pricing and other terms in our Long Term Supply Contracts in order to remain competitive, as described below, and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment. For example, during the three months ended March 28, 2009, we amended our Long Term Supply Contracts with certain customers to further reduce the sales price per watt under these contracts in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under the contracts. We also extended the payment terms for certain customers under these contracts from net 10 days to net 45 days to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in Malaysia. During the third quarter of 2009, we amended our Long Term Supply Contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provides a price rebate to certain of these customers for solar modules purchased from us. The intent of this program is to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core segments in Germany. The rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in Germany at the beginning of each quarter for the upcoming quarter. The rebate program is subject to periodic review, and we will adjust the rebate rate quarterly upward or downward as appropriate. The rebate period commenced during the third quarter of 2009 and terminates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. Customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program. We account for rebates as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules and therefore as a reduction in revenue. No rebates granted under this program can be claimed in cash, and all rebates will be applied to reduce outstanding accounts receivable balances. During the year ended December 26, 2009, we extended rebates to customers in the amount of 87.1 million ($128.9 million at an average exchange rate of $1.48/1.00). We also enter into one time module sale agreements with customers for specific projects. Under our customer contracts we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts. During 2009, principal customers of our components business were Blitzstrom GmbH, EDF EN Development, Gehrlicher Solar AG, Juwi Solar GmbH, and Phoenix Solar AG. During 2009, each of these five customers individually accounted for between 10% and 19% of our component segments net sales. All of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10% of our component business net sales during the year ended December 26, 2009. Page 38 Systems Business Through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution, which includes project development, EPC services, O&M services and, when required, project finance. Net sales from our systems segment are comprised of the following types of transactions: Transaction Description Engineer and Procure (EP) Contract Design of a solar electricity generation system for a customer that uses our solar modules; includes the procurement of all other required balance of system (BOS) components from third party suppliers. Engineer, Procure and Construct (EPC) Contract Design and construction for a customer of a turnkey solar electricity generation system that uses our solar modules; includes the procurement of all other BOS components from third party suppliers. Sale of Project Assets Sale of project assets to a customer at various stages of development. This generally includes a single project consisting of costs incurred for permits, land or land rights or power off take agreements. Operating and Maintenance (O&M) Agreement Typically a fixed priced long term services agreement. During the year ended December 26, 2009, net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the United States and Canada. Our systems business does not currently meet the quantitative criteria for disclosures as a separate reporting segment. On April 3, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar Inc. and we have integrated this business into our systems business. Net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors, including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards, economic incentives (such as European feed in tariffs or the federal investment tax credit in the United States) and other PV system demand drivers. For a given solar power project, we recognize revenue for our systems business either after execution of an EPC agreement with a third party, specifying the terms and conditions of the construction of the solar power plant; by applying the provisions for real estate accounting; by applying the percentage of completion method of accounting; or upon the sale of the complete system solution, as appropriate for the particular facts and circumstances related to the project and its sale. At any given point in time, aggregate contracted sales amounts with respect to the systems segment generally consist of the uncompleted portion of contracted projects where we have entered into a definitive EPC agreement with the customer. Cost of sales Components Business Our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as tempered back glass, transparent conductive oxide coated front glass, cadmium telluride, laminate, connector assemblies, laminate edge seal, and other items. Our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety expenses, quality and production control and procurement. Cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facility related expenses. In addition, we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales. Page 39 We implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use. Under our solar module collection and recycling program, we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules. In the agreement, we commit, at our expense, to collect the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their useful life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used solar modules or recycled to recover some of the raw materials. In return, the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our module collection and recycling program or any other program that we might approve of. The owner is also responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide. At the time we sell a solar module, we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future module collection and recycling obligation. We subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation, which we classify within selling, general and administrative expense. Overall, we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module, an increase in unit output per production line, continued geographic expansion into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale. Systems Business Within our systems business, project related costs include standard EPC costs (consisting primarily of balance of system costs for inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering costs, and installation labor costs), site specific costs, and development costs (including transmission upgrade costs, interconnection fees and permitting costs). As further described in Note 22. Segment Reporting, at the time when the revenue recognition criteria are met, we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business as net sales of our components business. Therefore, the related cost of sales will also be included within our components business. Deferred project costs represent capitalized costs related to the deferred revenue for project development or project construction activities sold to a third party typically under an EPC agreement, for which the revenue recognition criteria have not been met. We recognize these costs as we recognize the revenue for these projects. Deferred project costs at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 were $36.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Gross profit Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our average selling prices, foreign exchange rates, our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities. Gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures, and we have in the past and may in the future decide to amend our Long Term Supply Contracts, which specify our sales price per watt. Other factors impacting gross profits are the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached, the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses coupled with a geographic factor. Gross profit margin is affected by our systems business, which generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the pass through nature of certain balance of system components procured from third parties. Gross profit for our systems business excludes cost of sales for solar modules, that are included in the gross profit of our components business. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products, materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities. We acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense. We maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and PV systems using our modules. We maintain active collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (a division of the United States Department of Energy), Brookhaven National Laboratory and several universities. We report our research and development expense net of grant funding. We received $0.9 million and $1.8 million of grant funding during the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively, that we applied towards our research and development programs. We did not receive any grant funding during the year ended December 26, 2009. We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity. Over time, we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Page 40 Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expense and other selling expenses. We expect these expenses to increase in the near term, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts, improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting, compliance and other infrastructure required for an expanding public company. Over time, we expect selling, general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase. Production start up Production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. It also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. We incurred production start up expense of $16.9 million during the year ended December 29, 2007 in connection with the qualification of our German plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. We incurred production start up expense of $32.5 million during the year ended December 27, 2008 in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the Malaysian manufacturing center. Production start up expense for the year ended December 26, 2009 was $13.9 million and related to plant four of our Malaysian manufacturing center and our Ohio plant expansion. In general, we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. Over time, we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale. Foreign currency gain (loss) Foreign currency gain (loss) consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. Interest income Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash and investments. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, is incurred on various debt financings. Income Tax Expense Income taxes are imposed on our income by the taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, principally the United States, Germany and Malaysia. The statutory federal tax rate in the United States is 35% while the tax rate in Germany and Malaysia is approximately 28.5% and 25%, respectively. In Malaysia we have been granted a long term tax holiday, pursuant to which substantially all our income earned in Malaysia is exempt from income tax. Page 41 Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. Some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, on our forecasts and on other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 26, 2009 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our critical accounting estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, are as follows: Solar module collection and recycling. At the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives. We base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport, the cost of freight from the solar modules installation sites to a recycling center, the material, labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. We base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes, about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the timing of solar modules returns for recycling. In the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement. At December 26, 2009, our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was $92.8 million. A 10% decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by $9.0 million, to $83.8 million; a 10% increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by $9.1 million, to $101.9 million. Product warranties. We provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules. We also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years. Our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser. We accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales, using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing. Accounting for Income Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate. We establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Once established, we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense. Page 42 We also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. We have concluded that all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the United States. If our intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes, additional taxes may be required to be accrued. See Note 18. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We do not amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and, if necessary, we would record any impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. We will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. In the process of our annual impairment review, we primarily use the income approach of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach of valuation, which considers values of comparable businesses, to determine the fair value of our goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach. We reported $286.5 million of goodwill at December 26, 2009, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from Turner Renewable Energy, LLC and OptiSolar Inc. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 26, 2009 and concluded that it was not impaired. Testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps. The first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed. That step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities. Any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill, and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss. The fair value of our goodwill substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007: Years Ended December 26, 2009 December 27, 2008 December 29, 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 49.4 % 45.6 % 50.1 % Gross profit 50.6 % 54.4 % 49.9 % Research and development 3.8 % 2.7 % 3.0 % Selling, general and administrative 13.2 % 14.0 % 16.4 % Production start up 0.7 % 2.6 % 3.3 % Operating income 32.9 % 35.1 % 27.2 % Foreign currency gain 0.3 % 0.5 % 0.4 % Interest income 0.5 % 1.7 % 4.1 % Interest expense, net (0.3 )% 0.0 % (0.5 )% Other expense, net (0.1 )% (0.1 )% (0.3 )% Income tax expense (benefit) 2.2 % 9.3 % (0.5 )% Net income 31.1 % 27.9 % 31.4 % Page 43 Fiscal Years Ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 Net sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Net sales $ 2,066,200 $ 1,246,301 $ 819,899 66 % The increase in our net sales was primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined, resulting in a 114% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold during 2009 compared with 2008, and from an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business, partially offset by a decrease in our module average selling price. Revenue recognized for our systems business during 2009 was $115.0 million and resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems to utilities in the United States and Canada. The increase in MW volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of all four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center, continued improvements to our manufacturing process and the growth in our systems business. In addition, we increased the average conversion efficiency by approximately 3% during 2009 compared with 2008. Our average selling price decreased by approximately 25% during 2009 compared with 2008. Approximately 20% of the decline in our average selling price was primarily due to competitive pressure, including the commencement of a customer rebate program in the third quarter of 2009. Additionally, our average selling price was adversely impacted by approximately 4% due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and by approximately 1% due to a shift in customer mix. During 2009 and 2008, 65% and 74%, respectively, of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Cost of sales $ 1,021,618 $ 567,908 $ 453,710 80 % % of net sales 49.4 % 45.6 % The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes, which resulted from the commencement of production at all of our four plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center, production ramp of our Perrysburg, Ohio expansion, and an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business. The increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects: a $278.7 million increase in direct material expense (including an $8.2 million amortization of project assets acquired through our OptiSolar acquisition), a $41.0 million increase in warranty expense and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules due to increased sales, a $13.8 million increase in sales freight and other costs, and a $120.2 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs. The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $35.3 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses (including a $4.9 million increase in share based compensation expense), a $32.9 million increase in facility and related expenses and a $52.0 million increase in depreciation expense. Each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased infrastructure associated with the build out of our Malaysian manufacturing center and start up of our systems business. Our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by $0.21 per watt, or 19%, from $1.08 in 2008 to $0.87 in 2009 and included $0.01 of ramp penalty associated with the ramp and qualification of our Malaysian and Perrysburg manufacturing facilities and $0.01 of non cash stock based compensation. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Gross profit $ 1,044,582 $ 678,393 $ 366,189 54 % % of net sales 50.6 % 54.4 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 3.8% percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decline in our average selling prices by approximately 21%, partially offset by continued manufacturing cost per watt reduction of 19.4%. The decline in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro adversely impacted our gross profit by 2.2%. We expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses. Page 44 Research and development Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Research and development $ 78,161 $ 33,517 $ 44,644 133 % % of net sales 3.8 % 2.7 % The increase in our research and development expense was due to a $14.2 million increase in personnel related expense (including a $2.3 million increase in share based compensation expense) resulting from increased headcount. In addition, testing and qualification material costs increased by $18.0 million, consulting and other expenses increased by $11.5 million and grants received decreased by $0.9 million during 2009 compared with 2008. During fiscal 2009, we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and we increased the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3% in comparison to fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Selling, general and administrative $ 272,898 $ 174,039 $ 98,859 57 % % of net sales 13.2 % 14.0 % The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was due to a $66.0 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses (including a $23.0 million increase in share based compensation expense, of which, $15.7 million were one time charges associated with our executive management team). In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $13.3 million; and other expenses increased by $19.6 million and included $6.9 million of one time charges, of which, $5.5 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and operation of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar, which we acquired on April 3, 2009. Production start up Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Production start up $ 13,908 $ 32,498 $ (18,590 ) (57 )% % of net sales 0.7 % 2.6 % During 2009, we incurred $13.9 million of production start up expenses for our Malaysian and Perrysburg manufacturing expansions, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $32.5 million of production start up expenses for our Malaysian manufacturing expansion during 2008. Production start up expenses are comprised of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Page 45 Foreign currency gain Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Foreign currency gain $ 5,207 $ 5,722 $ (515 ) (9 )% Foreign currency gain decreased primarily due to a decrease in our net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Interest income Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Interest income $ 9,735 $ 21,158 $ (11,423 ) (54 )% Interest income decreased primarily due to a substantial decline in interest rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Interest expense, net $ 5,258 $ 509 $ 4,749 933 % Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased primarily due to lower amounts of interest expense capitalized during 2009. In addition, interest expense, net for 2009 includes a $2.4 million expense related to the termination of the interest rate swaps for our German debt facility. We fully repaid this facility on June 30, 2009. Other expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Other expense, net $ 2,985 $ 934 $ 2,051 220 % Other expense, net, increased primarily due to expenses associated with our credit default swaps, which expired in the second quarter of 2009. Page 46 Income tax expense Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Year Change Income tax expense $ 46,176 $ 115,446 $ (69,270 ) (60 )% Effective tax rate 6.7 % 24.9 % Income tax expense decreased primarily due to the effect of our tax holiday in Malaysia. During 2009, a significant amount of our pre tax income was generated in Malaysia where we have a 16.5 year tax holiday. In addition, we recognized an $11.5 million tax benefit during 2009 related to the reversal of 2008 Malaysian tax due to the pull forward of the tax holiday to 2008, which was granted in 2009. See also Note 18. Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Fiscal Years Ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 Net sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Net sales $ 1,246,301 $ 503,976 $ 742,325 147 % The increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 148% increase in the MW volume of solar modules sold during 2008 compared with 2007 due to strong demand for our solar modules in Europe. The increase in MW volume of solar modules sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our German plant, commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process. In addition, we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 4% during 2008 compared with 2007. Our average selling price decreased by approximately 1% during 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to a 6.5% contractual price decline, partially offset by a 6% increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Approximately 74% of our net sales during 2008 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in Germany. Cost of sales Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Cost of sales $ 567,908 $ 252,573 $ 315,335 125 % % of net sales 45.6 % 50.1 % The increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes, which resulted from the full production ramp of our German facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our Malaysian manufacturing center. These factors caused a $191.1 million increase in direct material expense, a $13.8 million increase in warranty and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules, a $9.4 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a $101.0 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs. The increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a $40.5 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses, including a $2.4 million increase in share based compensation expense, a $30.7 million increase in facility and related expenses and a $29.8 million increase in depreciation expense, in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our German and Malaysian expansions. Gross profit Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Gross profit $ 678,393 $ 251,403 $ 426,990 170 % % of net sales 54.4 % 49.9 % As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 4.5 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our German and Malaysian expansions, which drove a 148% increase in the number of megawatts sold. Our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased by 9% during 2008, while our average selling prices decreased by 1%. During 2008, foreign currency gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed approximately 1.9% and 5.6%, respectively, to our gross profit, partially offset by a 3.0% decline in our average selling prices. Page 47 Research and development Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Research and development $ 33,517 $ 15,107 $ 18,410 122 % % of net sales 2.7 % 3.0 % The increase in our research and development expense was due to a $13.7 million increase in personnel related expense (including a $1.2 million increase in share based compensation expense) due to increased headcount and additional share based compensation awards. In addition, consulting and other expenses increased by $3.8 million and grant revenue increased by $0.9 million during 2008 compared with 2007. Selling, general and administrative Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Selling, general and administrative $ 174,039 $ 82,248 $ 91,791 112 % % of net sales 14.0 % 16.4 % The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was due to a $62.0 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses (including a $15.5 million increase in share based compensation). In addition, legal and professional service fees increased by $13.0 million and other expenses increased by $16.8 million during 2008. The increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our solar power system and project development business as well as operating a global manufacturing business. Page 48 Production start up Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Production start up $ 32,498 $ 16,867 $ 15,631 93 % % of net sales 2.6 % 3.3 % During 2008, we incurred $32.5 million of production start up expenses for our Ohio and Malaysian manufacturing expansion, including legal, regulatory and personnel costs, compared with $16.9 million of production start up expenses for our German and Malaysian plant expansions during 2007. Production start up expenses are primarily the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines, related facility expenses, management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs. Foreign currency gain Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Foreign currency gain $ 5,722 $ 1,881 $ 3,841 204 % Foreign exchange gain increased by $3.8 million during 2008 due to a substantial increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the high volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, in particular the euro. Interest income Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Interest income $ 21,158 $ 20,413 $ 745 4 % Interest income remained relatively flat primarily as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2008, offset by a decline in interest rates. Interest expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Interest expense, net $ 509 $ 2,294 $ (1,785 ) (78 )% Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized due to the construction of our Malaysian manufacturing center. Page 49 Other expense, net Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Other expense, net $ 934 $ 1,219 $ (285 ) (23 )% Other expense, net consisted mainly of financing fees related to our credit facilities. During 2008, other expense was reduced by a mark to market gain of $0.6 million associated with our credit default swap. Income tax expense (benefit) Years Ended Year Over (Dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Year Change Income tax expense (benefit) $ 115,446 $ (2,392 ) $ 117,838 N.M. Effective tax rate 24.9 % (1.5 )% Income tax expense increased by $117.8 million, primarily due to the increase in pre tax income of $307.8 million, as well as the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2007 of $54.9 million. Our Malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of 16.5 years, which was originally scheduled to commence on January 1, 2009, which generally provides for a 100% exemption from Malaysian income tax. Subsequent to year end, we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year. Due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of 2008, we concluded that the financial impact should be reflected in our 2009 financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 26, 2009, we had $1,114.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared with $821.8 million as of December 27, 2008. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. However, if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions, we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan. Our expanding systems business is expected to have increasing liquidity requirements in the future. Solar power project development cycles, which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a photovoltaic power plant project, vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature. As a result of these long project cycles, we may need to make significant up front investments of resources in advance of the signing of power purchase agreements and EPC contracts and the receipt of any revenue. We have historically financed these up front investments primarily using working capital and cash on hand. In the future, we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings. Such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms, we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy. The unprecedented disruption in the credit markets over the past two years has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. As of December 26, 2009, our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. However, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment. Page 50 Cash Flows The following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 (in thousands): Years Ended 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 675,193 $ 463,067 $ 205,951 Net cash used in investing activities (701,690 ) (308,441 ) (547,250 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (22,021 ) 177,549 430,421 Effect of exchange rates on cash flows (3,201 ) (20,221 ) 7,050 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (51,719 ) $ 311,954 $ 96,172 Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $675.2 million during 2009 compared with $463.1 million during 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in net income and the impact of non cash items that were recorded on our statements of operations, primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation expense, offset by an increase in operating assets, primarily accounts receivable and deferred project costs. Cash received from customers increased to $1,957.6 million during 2009 compared with $1,203.8 million during 2008, primarily due to an increase in net sales, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $122.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the amendment of certain of our customers Long Term Supply Contracts to extend their payment terms from net 10 days to net 45 days primarily to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in Malaysia and due to additional volume shipped during 2009. Our net sales increased from $1,246.3 million during 2008 to $2,066.2 million during 2009. Cash paid to suppliers and associates increased to $1,123.7 million during 2009 from $723.1 million during 2008, mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our growth. Inventory increased by $52.1 million, of which $32.2 million related to an increase in finished goods inventory as a result of inventory requirements for utility scale projects in North America. Income taxes paid, net of refunds during 2009, were $147.8 million compared to $2.0 million during 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was $463.1 million during 2008 compared with $206.0 million during 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in net income, accounts payable and accrued expenses in this period as well as the impact of non cash items that were recorded on our statements of operations, primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation expense, offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support growth. Our inventories increased by $84.8 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in raw materials and work in process as a result of revenue growth. Cash received from customers increased to $1,203.8 million during 2008 from $516.0 million during 2007 primarily due to an increase in net sales. Our net sales increased from $504.0 million during 2007 to $1,246.3 million in 2008. This increase was partially offset by cash paid to suppliers and associates of $723.1 million during 2008 compared with cash paid to suppliers and associates of $276.5 million during 2007, mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases, an increase in personnel related costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion. Page 51 Investing activities Cash used in investing activities was $701.7 million during 2009 compared with $308.4 million during 2008. Cash used in investing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the net purchase of marketable securities of $342.5 million, the net investment in notes receivable of $74.2 million to fund construction of various photovoltaic power generation facilities, capital expenditures of $279.9 million, and an increase of $4.2 million in restricted investments to fund our solar module collection and recycling program. Capital expenditures during 2009 related primarily to the expansion of our plant in Perrysburg, Ohio and completion of construction of our new plants in Malaysia. See Note 11. Notes Receivable to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the above referenced notes receivable. On April 3, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar Inc. The total consideration consisted of 2,972,420 shares of our common stock, of which 355,096 shares represented a contingent consideration. The total purchase price based on the closing price of our common stock on April 3, 2009 of $134.38 per share was $399.4 million. See also Note 3. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to spend up to $550.0 million in capital expenditures for 2010, including expenditures related to the eight line expansion of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. A majority of our capital expenditures for 2010 will be incurred in foreign currency; and therefore, are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. At the beginning of each fiscal year we pre fund our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs for solar modules that we sold during the prior fiscal year through a custodial account with a large bank as investment advisor, in the name of a trust, for which First Solar, Inc., First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd, and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH are grantors. For this purpose we assume a minimum service life of 25 years for our solar modules. Prior to June 2009, we pre funded our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs through a financial services company. At December 26, 2009, we had $36.5 million in the new custodial account, which we classified in our restricted investments on our balance sheet. See Note 6. Restricted Cash and Investments to our consolidated financial statements for additional information Cash used in investing activities was $308.4 million during 2008 compared with $547.3 million during 2007. Cash used in investing activities during 2008 was primarily due to capital expenditures of $459.3 million related to the construction of our plants in Malaysia and Germany, an investment of $25.0 million in the preferred stock of a United States company that supplies solar power systems to commercial and residential customers and an increase in our restricted investments of $15.6 million to fund our solar module collection and recycling program, offset by the net sale of marketable securities of $191.4 million. On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Turner Renewable Energy, LLC, a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar power systems in the United States. The total consideration for the transaction was $34.3 million (excluding exit and transaction costs of $0.7 million); consisting of $28.0 million in common stock and $6.3 million in cash. See also Note 3. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities was $22.0 million during 2009 compared with cash provided by financing activities of $177.5 million during 2008. Cash used in financing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the repayment of long term debt of $78.2 million, which was partially offset by (i) proceeds of $44.7 million from the issuance of debt, net of issuance cost, related to the equipment export financing agreement for our Malaysian manufacturing center, (ii) proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $6.0 million during 2009 mainly due to the exercise of employee stock options and, (iii) excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements of $4.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $177.5 million during 2008 compared with $430.4 million during 2007. Cash provided by financing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in investment incentives related to the construction of our plant in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany of $35.7 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of issuance cost, of $138.9 million related to the equipment export facility agreement for our Malaysian manufacturing center. See Note 13. Debt to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these credit facilities. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of long term debt of $41.7 million in 2008. Excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements during 2008 were $28.7 million. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2007 were $376.1 million mainly due to the receipt of $366.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our follow on offering and $10.2 million of proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options. Page 52 Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 26, 2009, which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services. We purchase raw materials for inventory, services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements. Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (1) $ 196,388 $ 35,895 $ 65,995 $ 62,586 $ 31,912 Capital lease obligations 2 2 Operating lease obligations 72,183 8,392 20,719 13,988 29,084 Purchase obligations (2) 416,373 161,106 229,469 17,518 8,280 Recycling obligations 92,799 92,799 Total $ 777,745 $ 205,395 $ 316,183 $ 94,092 $ 162,075 (1) Includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt. (2) Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed minimum, or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of transactions. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, we have recorded $37.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Debt and Credit Sources Revolving Credit Facility On September 4, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement among First Solar, Inc., certain designated Borrowing Subsidiaries (consisting of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, a German subsidiary, and other subsidiaries of our Company who may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement) and several lenders. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America served as Joint Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners, with JPMorgan also acting as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides us and the borrowing subsidiaries with a senior secured three year revolving credit facility in an aggregate available amount of $300.0 million, a portion of which is available for letters of credit and swingline loans. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the facility up to $400.0 million. In connection with the Credit Agreement, we also entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements. At December 26, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $46.0 million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility, leaving approximately $254.0 million in capacity available under the revolving credit facility, $29.0 million of which may be used for letters of credit. As of this date, based on applicable indices, the all in effective three months LIBOR borrowing rate under the facility was 3.47%. See also Note 13. Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Page 53 Malaysian Facility Agreement On May 6, 2008, in connection with the plant expansion at our Malaysian manufacturing center, First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (FS Malaysia), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an export financing facility agreement (Malaysian Facility Agreement) with a consortium of banks. The total available loan amount was 134.0 million ($193.0 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00). Pursuant to the Malaysia Facility Agreement, we began semi annual repayments of the principal balances of these credit facilities during 2008. Amounts repaid under this credit facility cannot be re borrowed. At December 26, 2009, we had $168.3 million of borrowings outstanding, with no additional borrowing capacity available under this credit facility. See also Note 13. Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 26, 2009. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our international operations accounted for 93% of our net sales during 2009 and 95% of our net sales during 2008; of which, 92% and 100% of these international sales, respectively, were denominated in euros. As a result, we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses. In the past, most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts. For example, our Long Term Supply Contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. For the year ended December 26, 2009, a 10% change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by $177.7 million. For our manufacturing operations in Germany and Malaysia, many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries are denominated in the local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction exposure, cash flow exposure and earnings translation exposure. Transaction Exposure: Many components of our business have assets and liabilities (primarily receivables, investments, accounts payable, debt, solar module collection and recycling liabilities and inter company transactions) that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entitys functional currency. Changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge assets and liabilities against the short term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. As of December 26, 2009, the total unrealized loss on our foreign exchange forward contracts was $6.8 million. These contracts have maturities of less than two months. Since our acquisition of the solar power project development business of OptiSolar on April 3, 2009, we have also become exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. Page 54 As of December 26, 2009, the total notional value of our foreign exchange forward contracts was as follows (notional amounts and U.S. dollar equivalents in millions): Transaction Currency Notional Amount U.S. Equivalent Balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 Purchase Euro 229.1 $329.9 $1.44/1.00 Sell Euro 109.9 $158.3 $1.44/1.00 Sell U.S. dollar for Euro $27.2 $27.2 n/a Purchase Malaysian ringgits MYR 104.5 $30.3 $0.29/MYR1.00 Sell Malaysian ringgits MYR 22.8 $6.6 $0.29/MYR1.00 Purchase Japanese yen JPY 275.0 $2.8 $0.01/JPY1.00 Sell Japanese yen JPY 70.0 $0.7 $0.01/JPY1.00 Purchase Canadian dollar CAD 108.4 $103.0 $0.95/CAD1.00 Sell Canadian dollar CAD 120.1 $114.1 $0.95/CAD1.00 If the U.S. dollar would have weakened by 10% against the euro, Malaysian ringgit, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen, the favorable impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro, Malaysian ringgit, Canadian dollars and Japanese yen would have been $0.5 million. Cash Flow Exposure: We expect many of the components of our business to have material future cash flows, including revenues and expenses, which will be denominated in currencies other than the components functional currency. Our primary cash flow exposures are future customer collections and vendor payments. Changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currency and the other currencies in which they transact business will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled. Accordingly, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows. We account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. We initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction is realized. Most of our German plants operating expenses are denominated in euros, creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales. In addition, we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro. As of December 26, 2009, the unrealized loss on these contracts was $15.9 million and the total notional value of the contracts was 361.0 million ($519.8 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00). The weighted average forward exchange rate for these contracts was $1.40/1.00 at December 26, 2009. Earnings Translation Exposure: Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries. We may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations. These contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income, net. We do not hedge translation exposure at this time, but may do so in the future. In the past, currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations. For example, currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by $3.2 million and $20.2 million in the years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. Although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations, we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Page 55 Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system. Although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is considered to be approximately 25 years, end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation. As a result, many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditures. An increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system. This could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment, funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt. An increase in interest rates could lower an investors return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems, which, in each case, could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns. During 2006, we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks for the financing of our German plant, which bore interest at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) plus 1.6%. We had interest rate swap contracts with a financial institution that effectively converted to fixed rates the variable rate of Euribor on the term loan portion of this credit facility. These swap contracts were required under the credit facility agreement which we repaid and terminated on June 30, 2009. Therefore, we terminated these interest rate swap contracts on June 26, 2009 and consequently recognized interest expense of 1.7 million ($2.4 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00). The termination of the interest rate swap contracts settled on June 30, 2009. During May 2008, we entered into a euro denominated credit facility to finance some of the equipment cost for our Malaysian manufacturing center. The loans under the fixed rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 4.54%. The loans under the floating rate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at Euribor plus a margin of 0.55%. On May 29, 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of 57.3 million ($82.5 million at the balance sheet close rate on December 26, 2009 of $1.44/1.00) to receive a six month floating interest rate, equal to Euribor, and pay a fixed rate of 2.80%. This contract became effective on September 30, 2009. The notional amount of the interest rate swap contract is scheduled to decline in correspondence to our scheduled principal payments on the underlying hedged debt. In addition, we invest in debt securities, which exposes us to interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand, while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the market value of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including money market mutual funds, government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit. As of December 26, 2009, our fixed income investments earned a pre tax yield of 1.08%, with a weighted average maturity of 7.2 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease (increase) by $4.8 million. The direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of December 26, 2009, all of our investments were in money market mutual funds, federal and foreign agency debt, supranational debt, corporate debt securities, foreign government obligations and asset backed securities. Commodity and Component Risk We are exposed to price risks for the raw materials, components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules. Also, some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier. We endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers, a process which could take up to 12 months if successful, but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers. In some cases, we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components, but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our Long Term Supply Contracts with our customers. As a result, we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules. In addition, a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process. Since our selling price under our Long Term Supply Contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our Long Term Supply Contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their terms, we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption. Page 56 Credit Risk We have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk. These consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable, interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments. We place cash, cash equivalents, investments, interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty. We continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions.
