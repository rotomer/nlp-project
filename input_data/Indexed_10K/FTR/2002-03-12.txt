Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, words such as "believes", "anticipates", "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, any of the following possibilities: * Our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms; * Our ability to effectively manage our growth, including the integration of newly acquired operations into our operations, and otherwise monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality; * Our ability to divest the remainder of our public utilities services businesses; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings on a timely and cost effective basis, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms attractive to our customers, and our ability to offer second lines and enhanced services to markets currently under penetrated; * Our ability to expand through attractively priced acquisitions; * Our ability to identify future markets and successfully expand existing ones; * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * Electric Lightwave, Inc.s (ELIs) ability to complete a public or private financing that would provide the funds necessary to finance its cash requirements; * The effects of rapid technological changes, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; * The effects of changes in regulation in the telecommunications industry as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other similar federal and state legislation and regulation; * The effect of restructuring of portions of the telecommunications market; and * The effects of more general factors, including changes in economic conditions; changes in the capital markets; changes in industry conditions; changes in our credit ratings; and changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles. You should consider these important factors in evaluating any statement in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2001 we completed the Acquisition of Frontier and the permanent financings for our Frontier, Verizon and Qwest acquisitions. We also completed the sale of two of our public utilities services properties and repaid certain indebtedness and our equity forward contract. A summary of our primary sources and uses of cash is as follows: 19 ($ in thousands) For the year ended December 31, 2001 Primary Sources of Cash Generated by operating activities $ 520,379 Sale of public utility services properties 372,335 Net proceeds from debt financings 3,650,191 Net proceeds from equity units 445,635 Common stock offering 289,561 $ 5,278,101 Primary Uses of Cash Purchase of telephone properties $(3,373,214) Capital improvements (530,714) Repay indebtedness (1,077,931) Repay equity forward contracts (163,662) $(5,145,521) During January 2002, we sold another of our operations and received $855.7 million in cash proceeds and repaid $107.0 million in indebtedness. The details of these 2001 and 2002 transactions follow. In May 2001, we filed a $3.8 billion shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form S 3 that permits us to offer from time to time common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants to purchase these types of securities and units of the foregoing. The net proceeds from the sale of these securities have been and are expected to be used to refinance our bank borrowings and other extensions of credit, to expand our networks, services and related infrastructure, to fund working capital and pending and future acquisitions, to make further investments in related telecommunications businesses, as well as for general corporate purposes. After the offerings discussed below, we have a remaining availability on this shelf registration statement allowing us to offer $825.6 million. In May 2001, we issued an aggregate of $1.75 billion of notes consisting of $700 million principal amount of 8.50% notes due May 15, 2006 and $1.05 billion of 9.25% notes due May 15, 2011. This offering was made under the $3.8 billion shelf registration statement. Net proceeds of $1.726 billion (after underwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses) were used to repay bank borrowings and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes and to finance acquisitions. In June 2001, we issued equity securities in two concurrent public offerings. The first consisted of 25,156,250 shares of our common stock. The net proceeds of $289.6 million (after underwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses) were used to fund a portion of the acquisition of Frontier. The second offering consisted of $460 million of equity units. The net proceeds of $446.2 million (after underwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses) were also used to fund a portion of the acquisition of Frontier. Each equity unit initially consists of a senior note and a purchase contract for our common stock. The price for the common stock under this purchase contract will be based upon the average trading price of our stock at the time the contract is exercised and is expected to be paid with the proceeds of a remarketing of the senior notes. These offerings were also made under the $3.8 billion shelf registration statement. In August 2001, we issued an aggregate of $1.75 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $300 million of 6.375% notes due 2004, $750 million principal amount of 7.625% notes due 2008 and $700 million principal amount of 9.000% notes due 2031. These notes were issued in a private offering. The proceeds were used to repay our forward equity contract, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. In September 2001, we filed a $1.75 billion registration statement with the SEC on Form S 4 that consists of an exchange offer entitling the holders of the notes issued in August 2001 to exchange the initial notes for new notes with substantially identical terms as the initial notes, except for transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the initial notes. The registration statement was declared effective on February 6, 2002, and we commenced our exchange offer at that time. The exchange offer is expected to terminate on March 11, 2002. 20 In October 2001, we borrowed $200 million on an unsecured basis from the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC). This note matures on October 24, 2011 and has a fixed 6.27% interest rate. We have committed to continue to finance ELIs cash requirements until March 31, 2003. We extended a revolving credit facility to ELI for $450 million with an interest rate of 15% and a final maturity of October 30, 2005. Funds for general corporate purposes of $350 million are available to be drawn until December 31, 2002. The remaining balance may be drawn by ELI to pay interest expense due under the facility. As of December 31, 2001, we have advanced $194.5 million to ELI under this facility. In April 2001, we converted and remarketed $14.4 million of 1991 series industrial development revenue bonds as money market bonds with an initial interest rate of 5.25% and a maturity date of April 1, 2026. In May 2001, we converted and remarketed $23.3 million of Illinois 1997 series of environmental facilities revenue bonds due May 1, 2032 at an initial interest rate of 5.85%. We also converted and remarketed $18.3 million of Northampton County, Pennsylvania 1998 series of industrial development revenue bonds due September 1, 2018 at an initial interest rate of 5.75%. Both series were remarketed as money market bonds and were associated with our discontinued water and wastewater treatment operations. On June 29, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Frontier Corp. from Global for $3.37 billion in cash. The acquisition was financed on an interim basis by the draw down of a bank credit facility of $1.78 billion, with the remainder derived from the proceeds of our registered securities offerings discussed above. The bank credit facility was repaid in August 2001 with the proceeds of our private offering of senior notes discussed above. On July 2, 2001, we completed the sale of our Louisiana gas operations to Atmos Energy Corp for $363.4 million in cash. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our borrowings under our bank credit facility. During 2000, we entered into an equity forward contract with Citibank, N.A. to purchase 9,140,000 shares of our common stock. These purchases and others made by us for cash during 2000 were made in open market transactions. The amount to be paid under the forward contract included a LIBOR based carrying cost plus the dollar amount paid for the shares acquired. This forward contract was a temporary financing arrangement that provided us the flexibility to effectively purchase our stock in the current period and to pay for those purchases in a future period. Pursuant to transition accounting rules, commencing December 31, 2000 through June 30, 2001 we were required to report our equity forward contract as a reduction in shareholders equity and as a component of temporary equity for the gross settlement amount of the contract ($150.0 million). On June 28, 2001, we entered into a master confirmation agreement that amended the equity forward contract to eliminate the share settlement feature of the original contract. During 2001, we settled the contract for $150.0 million plus $13.6 million in associated carrying costs, and took possession of our shares. On September 4, 2001, $50 million principal amount of our 8.45% debentures matured and were repaid at par with cash. On October 1, 2001, $99.2 million principal amount of our $100 million debentures due 2034 were tendered for redemption at par in accordance with the put option granted to debenture holders at the time of issuance. These tendered debentures were also repaid with cash. On November 30, 2001, we completed the sale of our Colorado gas operations to Kinder Morgan, Inc. for $8.9 million in cash. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In December 2001, two of our ILEC subsidiaries, Citizens Telecommunications Company of West Virginia and Rhinelander Telephone Company, made cash payments of $12.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively, representing repayment of all of their outstanding obligations to the Rural Utilities Service and the Rural Telephone Bank. On January 7, 2002, we called for redemption at par two of our outstanding 1991 series of industrial development revenue bonds, the $20.0 million 7.15% Mohave series and the $10.1 million 7.15% Santa Cruz series. Both redemptions were funded with cash. On January 15, 2002, we completed the sale of our water and wastewater operations to American Water Works for $855.7 million in cash plus the assumption of $123.8 million of debt. The proceeds are being used to continue to expand our networks, services and related infrastructure, to fund working capital and pending and future acquisitions, to make further investments in related telecommunications businesses, as well as for general corporate purposes (including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.) 21 On January 31, 2002, we repaid approximately $76.9 million principal amount of loans outstanding to our subsidiaries from the Rural Utilities Service, Rural Telephone Bank and the Federal Financing Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2001, our actual capital expenditures were $409.3 million for the ILEC segment, $54.5 million for the ELI segment and $89.9 million for the public utilities services segments which includes $23.0 million for the water and wastewater segment. For 2002, we anticipate that our capital expenditures will approximate $525.6 million; $412.0 million for the ILEC segment, $71.6 million for ELI and $42.0 million for the public utility services segment. We anticipate that the primary sources of funds in 2002 will come from our ILEC operations. We have a remaining shelf registration of $825.6 million and we have available lines of credit with financial institutions in the amount of $705 million and $100 million. The credit facilities have similar terms and conditions. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our credit ratings, and are 0.25% per annum as of December 31, 2001. The expiration date for both facilities is October 24, 2006. During the term of the facilities we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds. As of December 31, 2001, there were no outstanding advances under these facilities. ELI has a $400 million committed revolving line of credit with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires on November 21, 2002. The ELI credit facility has an associated facility fee of 0.08% per annum. We have guaranteed all of ELIs obligations under this revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2001, $400 million was outstanding under this credit facility. During 1995, ELI entered into a $110 million construction agency agreement and an operating lease agreement in connection with the construction of certain network facilities. In January 2002, ELI exercised its option to purchase the facilities at the end of the lease term. Payments under the lease depend on current interest rates. Assuming continuation of current interest rates, payments would approximate $872,000 from January 1, 2002 through April 30, 2002 and a final payment of approximately $110 million in April 2002. Citizens has guaranteed all of ELIs obligations under this operating lease. On December 17, 2001, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, each agreement covering a notional amount of $50 million. Under the terms of both agreements, we make semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed 6.375% rate on the notional amount. Under the terms of one swap, the underlying LIBOR rate is set in advance, while the second agreement utilizes LIBOR reset in arrears. Both swaps terminate on August 15, 2004 and are being accounted for under SFAS 133 as fair value hedges. A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001 is as follows: Less than After (in thousands) Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Long term debt $ 6,341,430 $ 476,488 $ 772,250 $ 1,348,043 $ 3,744,649 Capital lease obligations 137,382 7,418 5,804 6,855 157,459 Operating leases 161,817 25,777 43,068 32,123 60,849 Purchase obligation 110,000 110,000 Other long term obligations 925,024 115,416 147,425 78,948 583,235 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,675,653 $ 735,099 $ 968,547 $ 1,465,969 $ 4,546,192 Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facility agreements are of a general nature, and do not impose significant financial performance criteria on us. These general covenants include the timely and punctual payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and similar transactions. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries either by contract, rule or regulation. 22 The principal financial performance covenant under our $805 million credit facilities and our $200 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC) requires the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $1.5 billion. Under the RTFC loan, in the event that our credit rating from either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors declines below investment grade (Baa3/BBB , respectively), we would be required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1 or greater and a leverage ratio of 6.00 to 1 or lower. Acquisitions From May 27, 1999 through July 12, 2000 we entered into several agreements to acquire telephone access lines. These transactions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired properties have been included in our financial statements from the dates of acquisition of each property. These agreements and the status of each transaction are described as follows: Verizon Acquisition Between May and December 1999, we announced agreements to purchase from Verizon Communications Inc., formerly GTE Corp. (Verizon), approximately 381,200 telephone access lines (as of December 31, 2000) for approximately $1,171.0 million in cash. By November 30, 2000, we had closed on the purchase of approximately 317,500 telephone access lines. On December 17, 2001, the agreements to acquire the remaining telephone access lines were terminated. Qwest Acquisition termination In June 1999, we announced agreements to purchase from Qwest approximately 556,800 telephone access lines (as of December 31, 2000) in nine states for approximately $1,650.0 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. On October 31, 2000, we closed on the purchase of approximately 17,000 telephone access lines in North Dakota for approximately $38.0 million in cash. On July 20, 2001, we notified Qwest that we were terminating the remaining eight acquisition agreements. Qwest subsequently filed a notice of claim for arbitration in Denver, Colorado under the rules of the American Arbitration Association with respect to the terminated acquisition agreements. Qwest asserts that we wrongfully terminated these agreements and is seeking approximately $64.0 million, which is the aggregate of liquidation damages under letters of credit, established in the terminated acquisition agreements. We have filed a notice of claim in the same arbitration proceeding, contesting Qwests asserted claims and asserting substantial claims against Qwest for material breaches of representations, warranties and covenants in the terminated acquisition agreements and in the acquisition agreement relating to North Dakota assets that we purchased from Qwest. Frontier Acquisition On June 29, 2001, we purchased from Global 100% of the stock of Frontier Corp.s (Frontier) local exchange carrier subsidiaries, which owns approximately 1.1 million telephone access lines in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, for approximately $3,373.0 million in cash, subject to routine purchase price adjustment. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture for our public utilities services businesses, which include gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. During 2001 we sold two of our natural gas operations and in January 2002 we sold all of our water and wastewater treatment operations. The Arizona and Vermont electric divisions were under contract to be sold to Cap Rock Energy Corp. (Cap Rock). The agreement with Cap Rock was terminated on March 7, 2001. We intend to pursue the disposition of the Vermont and Arizona electric divisions with alternative buyers. In March 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Kauai electric division to Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) for $215 million. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close within twelve months. Currently, we do not have agreements to sell our entire gas and electric segments. Consequently, we have reflected all of our gas and electric assets and their related liabilities as "assets held for sale" and "liabilities related to assets held for sale," respectively. We also reflect the results of these operations as part of continuing operations. Additionally, we ceased to record depreciation expense on the gas assets effective October 1, 2000 and on the electric assets effective January 1, 2001. Such depreciation expense would have been an additional $50.8 million for the gas operations and $6.8 million for electric operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. We continue to actively pursue buyers for our remaining gas and electric business. 23 Discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income reflect the results of operations of the water/wastewater properties sold in January 2002 including allocated interest expense for the periods presented. Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations based on the outstanding debt specifically identified with this business. Discontinuation of SFAS 71: Prior to the 2000 and 2001 acquisitions of the Verizon, Qwest and Frontier Properties, our incumbent local exchange telephone properties had been predominantly regulated following a cost of service/rate of return approach. Accordingly, we applied the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 in the preparation of our financial statements. Currently, pricing for a majority of our revenues in our previously existing incumbent local exchange telephone properties is based upon price cap plans that limit prices to changes in general inflation and estimates of productivity for the industry at large or upon market pricing rather than on the specific costs of operating our business, a requirement for the application of SFAS 71. These trends in the deregulation of pricing and the introduction of competition are expected to continue as additional states adopt price cap forms of regulation. We intend to operate all of our properties as competitive enterprises, to meet competitive entry and maximize revenue by providing a broad range of products and services, such as data services. Many of these future services will not be regulated, further increasing the percentage of our revenue provided by our networks that is not based upon historical cost/rate of return regulation. In the third quarter of 2001, we concluded based on the factors mentioned above, that the provisions of SFAS 71 were no longer applicable to our incumbent local exchange telephone properties (properties we owned prior to the 2000 and 2001 acquisitions of the Verizon, Qwest and Frontier properties). As part of the discontinuation of SFAS 71, we will no longer recognize in our financial statements certain activities of regulators. As discussed further in Note 19 of the financial statements, we recorded a non cash extraordinary charge of $43.6 million net of tax in our income statement, to write off regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet in the past. Based upon our evaluation of the pace of technology change that is estimated to occur in certain components of our rural telephone networks, we have concluded that minor modifications in our asset lives are required for the major network technology assets and expect that depreciation and amortization expense will not differ significantly from that currently recorded. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 101 and SFAS 121, we performed a test of the impairment of the property, plant and equipment accounts for our properties discontinuing SFAS 71 and based upon our expectations of future changes in sales volumes and prices and the anticipated rate of entry of additional competition into our markets, we concluded that an asset impairment is not warranted under SFAS 121 at this time. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 141, "Business Combinations." This statement requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting. We adopted SFAS No. 141 on July 1, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 141 did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This statement requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment. SFAS 142 is effective January 1, 2002. We will be required to test for impairment of goodwill as of January 1, 2002 and annually thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss at January 1, 2002 will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations. The amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of the statement. As of the date of adoption, we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,939.3 million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of $1,039.7 million. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $108.1 million, $13.6 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting SFAS 142, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this Statement on our financial statements at the date of this report, including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We are required to make such assessment no later than June 30, 2002 but such assessment is "as of" January 1, 2002. 24 In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and reported as a liability. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 143. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets." This statement establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS 121, for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 144. 25 (b) Results of Operations REVENUE ILEC revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local and long distance telephone service. Such services are provided under either a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at a tariffed rate and is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. CLEC revenue is generated through local, long distance, data and long haul services. These services are primarily provided under a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at agreed upon rates and are not dependent upon significant judgments by management with the exception of the determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. CLEC usage based revenue includes amounts determined under reciprocal compensation agreements. While this revenue is governed by specific contracts with the counterparty, management has deferred recognition of portions of such revenue until realizability was obtained. Revenue earned from long haul contracts, including the fiber swap, is recognized over the term of the related agreement. Revenue from the provision of public utility services are recognized based on usage without significant judgments made by management with the exception of amounts determined for uncollectible accounts. Consolidated revenue increased $654.6 million, or 36%, in 2001 and $204.1 million, or 13%, in 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions in the ILEC sector as well as the pass through to customers of the increased cost of gas. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to the pass through to customers of the increased cost of gas, electric energy and fuel oil purchased as well as ILEC acquisitions and increased ELI revenue. ILEC REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Network access services $ 654,641 45% $ 451,402 2% $ 444,409 Local network services 582,662 78% 326,878 14% 286,271 Long distance and data services 208,274 95% 106,662 17% 90,978 Directory services 72,375 93% 37,424 11% 33,636 Other 76,101 84% 41,377 14% 47,943 $ 1,594,053 65% $ 963,743 7% $ 903,237 We acquired the Verizon Nebraska access lines on June 30, 2000, the Verizon Minnesota access lines on August 31, 2000, the Qwest North Dakota access lines on October 31, 2000 and the Verizon Illinois/Wisconsin access lines on November 30, 2000 and Frontier on June 29, 2001 (collectively referred to as the Acquisitions). The 2001 impact of the Acquisitions of $569.8 million in the following revenue and expense discussion represents six months of activity for Frontier which was acquired on June 29, 2001 and the difference between a full year in 2001 versus a partial year in 2000 for the Verizon Nebraska, Minnesota and Illinois/Wisconsin and Qwest North Dakota acquisitions. The 2000 impact of the Acquisitions of $49.5 million in the following revenue and expense discussion represents the activity for each acquisition from its respective date of acquisition. Network access services revenue increased $203.2 million, or 45%, in 2001 primarily due to the $159.1 million impact of the Acquisitions. Growth in minutes of use, special access and subsidies revenue contributed $3.1 million, $17.9 million and $20.0 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by $6.5 million from the effect of the FCCs CALLS mandate which reduced access charges paid by long distance companies and $7.3 million in rate decreases in effect as of July 1, 2001. Network access also includes a reclassification of $13.9 million in revenue reported as local network services revenue in the prior year. Network access services revenue increased $7.0 million, or 2%, in 2000, primarily due to the $23.9 million impact of the Acquisitions and $15.4 million related to growth in minutes of use and special access revenue. These increases were partially offset by a non recurring $10.4 million interstate universal service fund (USF) settlement received in the first quarter of 1999, the effect of CALLS of $14.8 million, settlements with long distance carriers of $2.3 million in 1999, and the price effect of a July 1999 FCC tariff adjustment of $1.8 million. 26 Local network services revenue increased $255.8 million, or 78%, in 2001, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions which contributed $260.9 million and growth in enhanced services of $8.1 million. Local network services also reflects a reduction for the reclassification of $13.9 million in revenue reported as network access revenue in the prior year. Local network services revenue increased $40.6 million, or 14%, in 2000, primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions which contributed $23.8 million, growth in enhanced services of $6.3 million due to increased demand for these services, access line growth of 26,000 contributed $5.0 million and frame relay, data and ISDN increased $4.0 million. These increases were partially offset by an Extended Area Service revenue phase out in New York of $3.1 million. Long distance and data services revenue increased $101.6 million, or 95%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions of $78.2 million, principally the long distance and data revenue associated with Frontier, which contributed $74.1 million to the increase. Growth in Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Internet services of $7.9 million, growth related to data and dedicated circuits of $7.0 million and growth in long distance services of $7.7 million also contributed to the increase. Long distance and data services revenue increased $15.7 million, or 17%, in 2000 primarily due to increased Internet revenue of $6.0 million, increased DSL, frame relay and ISDN services of $5.5 million and increased remote call forwarding of $2.7 million. Directory services revenue increased $35.0 million, or 93%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions which contributed $33.2 million to the increase and growth of $1.8 million. Directory services revenue increased $3.8 million, or 11%, in 2000 primarily due to increased directory advertising and listing sales. The Acquisitions contributed $1.0 million to the increase in 2000. Other revenue increased $34.7 million, or 84%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions of $38.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous revenue categories. Other revenue decreased $6.6 million, or 14%, in 2000 primarily due to a decrease in billing and collections revenue of $6.4 million and an increase in the reserve for uncollectibles of $3.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from the Acquisitions of $0.8 million, an increase of $2.8 million in conference call revenue and an increase of $0.3 million in cable revenue. ELI REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Network services $ 101,338 31% $ 77,437 45% $ 53,249 Local telephone services 73,291 26% 98,643 27% 77,591 Long distance services 12,294 25% 16,318 39% 26,698 Data services 39,717 23% 51,579 75% 29,470 226,640 7% 243,977 30% 187,008 Intersegment revenue* (3,249) 2% (3,185) 13% (2,817) $ 223,391 7% $ 240,792 31% $ 184,191 * Intersegment revenue represents revenue received by ELI from our ILEC operations related to network services provided by ELI. Revenue (before intersegment revenue eliminations) decreased $17.3 million, or 7%, in 2001 and increased $57.0 million, or 30%, in 2000. The decline in revenue for 2001 is primarily due to a downturn in economic conditions that affected internet service providers and related businesses; a decline in data services due to the expiration of a material contract; and a decrease in reciprocal compensation. Included in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 is approximately $4.0 million of revenue representing a "net settlement" of past billing disputes between ELI and Qwest. Additionally, ELI is currently providing service to customers that have filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Of ELIs largest twenty five customers, two customers are under Chapter 11 protection. These customers contributed approximately $0.3 million of revenue monthly. 27 Network services revenue increased $23.9 million, or 31%, in 2001 and $24.2 million, or 45%, in 2000. Network services include Private Line Interstate (Long Haul) and Private Line Intrastate (MAN). The increase is primarily due to continued growth in our network and sales of additional circuits for MAN services. Revenue for 2001 and 2000 from Long Haul services increased $3.9 million, or 10%, and $12.0 million, or 43%, respectively. Revenue for 2001 and 2000 from MAN services increased $20.0 million, or 54%, and $12.2 million, or 48%, respectively. Local telephone services revenue decreased $25.4 million, or 26%, in 2001 and increased $21.1 million, or 27%, in 2000. Local telephone services include dial tone, ISDN PRI, carrier access billings and reciprocal compensation. ($ In thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount ISDN PRI $ 27,299 19% $ 33,846 53% $ 22,160 Dial tone 16,730 13% 19,208 40% 13,746 Carrier access billings 7,934 18% 6,714 4% 7,020 Reciprocal compensation 21,328 45% 38,875 12% 34,665 $ 73,291 26% $ 98,643 27% $ 77,591 ISDN PRI revenue decreased $6.5 million, or 19%, in 2001 and increased $11.7 million, or 53%, in 2000. The 2001 decrease in ISDN PRI revenue is primarily due to the bankruptcy of two customers and decreased revenue resulting from less demand for ISDN PRI trunks servicing internet routers. In addition, average access line equivalents decreased 19,245, or 10%, in 2001 compared to 2000. The 2000 increase in ISDN PRI revenue is a result of an increase in the average access line equivalents of 64,206, or 46% in 2000 over 1999. Dial tone revenue decreased $2.5 million, or 13%, in 2001 and increased $5.4 million, or 40%, in 2000. The 2001 decrease is primarily due to the bankruptcy of two customers and decreased installation fees resulting from fewer new customers. In addition, average access line equivalents decreased 19,245, or 10% in 2001 compared to 2000. The 2000 increase in dial tone revenue is the result of an increase in the average access line equivalents of 64,206, or 46% in 2000 over 1999. Carrier access billings revenue increased $1.2 million, or 18%, in 2001 and decreased $0.3 million, or 4%, in 2000. The increase in 2001 is primarily due to the settlement of disputes with two major customers partially offset by the effects of a 12% decrease in average rates per minute. The decrease in 2000 compared to 1999 is due to an increase in average monthly minutes processed of 15 million, or 77%, offset by the effects of lower average rates per minute primarily due to competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate. Reciprocal compensation revenue decreased $17.5 million, or 45%, in 2001 and increased $4.2 million, or 12%, in 2000. The decrease in 2001 is primarily due to a 19% decrease in average rates per minute and a 14% decrease in average monthly minutes processed of 158 million. The decrease in average minutes is primarily due to less termination generated minutes from ISDN PRI. The increase for 2000 over 1999 is due to interconnection agreements being in place with Verizon and PacBell during all of 2000 that were not in place for all 12 months in 1999. ELI has various interconnection agreements with Qwest (formerly U S WEST), Verizon (formerly GTE) and SBC (PacBell) and Sprint, the ILECs in the states in which it operates. These agreements govern reciprocal compensation relating to the transport and termination of traffic between the ILECs networks and ELIs network. The FCC set transitional rates for reciprocal compensation that exceeds a 3:1 ratio of inbound to outbound traffic. The rate for above ratio traffic is capped at .15 cents per minute for the first six months after the effective date of the commission order, .10 cents per minute for the next 18 months and .07 cents per minute after that, through June 2004. Below ratio traffic remains at the state established rate level which is generally higher. Implementation of the FCCs transitional rates for ISP bound traffic is taking place via amendments to existing interconnection agreements. The effect of implementing the FCC transitional rates resulted in a reduction of the composite rate of .088 cents per minute, or 43%, from .203 cents per minute for the six months ended June 30, 2001 to .115 cents per minute. The Verizon interconnection agreements expired in May and June 2001 for Washington and Oregon, respectively. We are currently negotiating agreements with PacBell and Verizon. The existing terms of the interconnection agreements remain in place during the negotiations. As a result of recent FCC mandates, we do not anticipate that renewal of the interconnection agreements will be at terms as favorable to ELI as in the past. 28 Long distance services revenue decreased $4.0 million, or 25%, in 2001 and $10.4 million, or 39%, in 2000. Long distance services include retail long distance, wholesale long distance and prepaid services. Retail long distance decreased $0.6 million, or 7%, in 2001 and increased $2.3 million, or 35%, in 2000. The 2001 decrease is primarily due to a decrease in average rates per minute of 6%, partially offset by a 1% increase in average monthly minutes processed. The increase in 2000 over 1999 is due to an increase in average monthly minutes processed of 3.1 million, or 47% partially offset by lower average rates per minute. Wholesale long distance decreased $2.4 million, or 39%, in 2001 and increased $0.1 million, or 2%, in 2000. The decrease in 2001 is primarily due to a decrease in average monthly minutes processed of 4.8 million, or 28%, as a result of less wholesale long distance customers. We intend to focus on higher margin retail long distance customers. A decrease of 16% in the average rate per minute also contributed to the decrease in 2001. The increase in 2000 is due to an increase in average monthly minutes processed of 0.9 million, or 6% partially offset by lower average rates per minute. Prepaid services revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 99%, in 2001 and $12.8 million, or 93%, in 2000. The decreases are attributable to our decision to exit the prepaid services market in the third quarter of 1999. Data services include Internet, RSVP and other services. Data services revenue decreased $11.9 million, or 23%, in 2001 primarily due to loss of a contract with a significant customer. Data services revenue increased $22.1 million, or 75%, in 2000 primarily due to revenue from the 18 month contract.

Included in gas revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is approximately $218.8 million, $232.3 million and $175.4 million, respectively, of revenue from our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations that will not continue since the sales closed July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Gas revenue increased $67.8 million, or 22%, in 2000 primarily due to higher purchased gas costs passed on to customers partially offset by a $27 million settlement of a proceeding with the Louisiana Public Service Commission during the fourth quarter of 2000. Under tariff provisions, increases in our costs of gas purchased are largely passed on to customers. ELECTRIC REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Electric revenue $ 228,015 2% $ 223,072 9% $ 203,822 Electric revenue increased $4.9 million, or 2%, in 2001 primarily due to customer growth and increased consumption due to warmer weather conditions. Electric revenue increased $19.3 million, or 9%, in 2000, primarily due to higher supplier prices passed on to customers and increased consumption. Under tariff provisions, increases in our costs of electric energy and fuel oil purchased are largely passed on to customers. 29 COST OF SERVICES ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Gas purchased $ 282,061 23% $ 229,538 50% $ 152,667 Electric energy and fuel oil purchased 123,223 8% 113,965 16% 98,533 Network access 197,018 40% 141,165 5% 148,798 Intersegment expense* (2,924) 2% (2,995) 6% (2,817) $ 599,378 24% $ 481,673 21% $ 397,181 * Intersegment expenses represented expenses incurred by our ILEC operations related to network services provided by ELI. Gas purchased increased $52.5 million, or 23%, in 2001 primarily due to higher purchased gas costs partially offset by decreased gas purchased due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations. Included in gas purchased for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is approximately $173.3 million, $151.4 million and $94.3 million, respectively, of gas purchased by our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations that will not continue since the sales closed July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Gas purchased increased $76.9 million, or 50%, in 2000 primarily due to higher purchased gas costs. Under tariff provisions, increases in our costs of gas purchased are largely passed on to customers. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased increased $9.3 million, or 8%, in 2001 primarily due to higher purchased power prices, customer growth and increased consumption due to warmer weather conditions. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased increased $15.4 million, or 16%, in 2000 primarily due to higher supplier prices and increased consumption. Under tariff provisions, increases in our costs of electric energy and fuel oil purchased are largely passed on to customers. Gas, electric energy and fuel oil purchased excludes amounts deferred for future recovery in rates. During the past two years, the power supply costs have fluctuated substantially forcing companies in some cases to pay higher operating costs to operate their electric businesses. In Arizona, excessive power costs charged by our power supplier in the amount of approximately $100 million through December 31, 2001 have been incurred. We are allowed to recover these charges from ratepayers through the Purchase Power Fuel Adjustment clause. However, in an attempt to limit "rate shock" to our customers, we requested in September 2001 that this amount, plus interest, be recovered over a seven year period. As a result, we have deferred these costs on the balance sheet in anticipation of recovery through the regulatory process. We anticipate a determination regarding recovery to be made in 2002. On July 16, 2001, we terminated our existing contract with Arizona Public Service and entered into a new seven year purchase power agreement. This agreement allows us to purchase all power required for operations at a fixed rate per kilowatt hour. This agreement is retroactive to June 1, 2001 and will mitigate further increases in the deferred power cost account. Network access expenses increased $55.9 million, or 40%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions, increased circuit expense associated with additional data product introductions and an Internet remote call forwarding adjustment partially offset by a reduction in long distance access expense related to rate changes in the ILEC sector and reduced network access expenses at ELI. Network access expense decreased $7.6 million, or 5%, in 2000 primarily due to a reduction in costs related to the 2000 exit of ELIs prepaid services business, partially offset by increased costs related to increased revenue growth and network expansion at ELI. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Depreciation expense $ 488,424 32% $ 369,930 20% $ 307,428 Amortization expense 143,912 714% 17,677 541% 2,757 $ 632,336 63% $ 387,607 25% $ 310,185 30 Depreciation expense increased $118.5 million, or 32%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions of $119.1 million and $22.0 million of accelerated depreciation related to the change in useful lives of our accounting and human resource systems and our Plano, Texas office building, furniture and fixtures as a result of our restructuring. The accelerated depreciation will continue over the next six months. The incremental increase to depreciation is estimated to be $11.9 million and $.9 million for the first quarter of 2002 and second quarter of 2002, respectively. Higher property, plant and equipment balances in the telecommunications and ELI sectors also contributed to the increase. The increases were partially offset by decreased depreciation expense related to our classifying our gas and electric sectors as "assets held for sale" which requires us to cease depreciating these assets. Such depreciation expense would have been an additional $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase is also offset by $17.4 million in the prior year period of accelerated depreciation related to the change in useful life of an operating system in the telecommunications sector. Depreciation expense increased $62.5 million, or 20%, in 2000 primarily due to higher plant in service balances for newly completed communications network facilities and electronics at ELI, increased property, plant and equipment, the impact of the Acquisitions of $14.6 million and an increase of $12.6 million in accelerated depreciation related to the change in useful life of an operating system in the ILEC sector. Depreciation expense was partially offset by $6.8 million of decreased depreciation expense resulting from the classification of our gas sector as "assets held for sale." Depreciation on gross gas property, plant and equipment was discontinued effective October 1, 2000. Amortization expense increased $126.2 million, or 714%, in 2001 and $14.9 million, or 541%, in 2000 primarily due to amortization of intangibles related to the Acquisitions of $125.6 million and $13.6 million, respectively. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Operating expenses $ 724,074 21% $ 597,274 7% $ 642,300 Taxes other than income taxes 109,478 9% 100,101 2% 102,357 Sales and marketing 96,778 30% 74,622 15% 64,645 $ 930,330 21% $ 771,997 5% $ 809,302 Operating expenses increased $126.8 million, or 21%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. The increase was partially offset by decreased operating expenses at ELI primarily due to a reduction in personnel, decreased operating expenses in the gas sector primarily due to the sale of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations and a decrease in compensation expense related to variable stock plans. A $1.00 change in our stock price can impact compensation expense by $1.0 million annually. Operating expenses decreased $45.0 million, or 7%, in 2000 primarily due to the following items which were incurred in 1999: asset impairment charges of $36.1 million related to the discontinuation of the development of certain operational systems and certain regulatory assets deemed to be no longer recoverable, Y2K expenses of $17.3 million, restructuring charges related to our corporate office of $5.2 million, costs associated with an executive retirement agreement of $6.0 million and separation costs of $4.6 million. The 2000 amount also decreased due to $5.1 million of various expense reductions in the ILEC sector resulting from outsourcing and productivity enhancements. The decreases were partially offset by $15.1 million of increased operating expenses in 2000 related to the Acquisitions, increased operating costs of $11.0 million at ELI to support the expanded delivery of services and legal fees in the gas sector of $2.7 million associated with the settlement of a proceeding with the Louisiana Public Service Commission during the fourth quarter of 2000. Taxes other than income increased $9.4 million, or 9%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions. Taxes other than income taxes decreased $2.3 million, or 2%, in 2000 primarily due to decreased payroll taxes resulting from a reduction in headcount in the gas and electric sectors, a payroll tax adjustment in the gas sector in 2000 and a reduction in property taxes. 31 Sales and marketing expenses increased $22.2 million, or 30%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions and increased telemarketing costs in the telecommunications sector. Sales and marketing expenses increased $10.0 million, or 15%, in 2000 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions and increased costs associated with new product offerings in the ILEC sector partially offset by headcount reductions resulting from exiting ELIs prepaid services business in 1999. WRITE DOWN OF GLOBAL CROSSING RECEIVABLES / RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES / ACQUISITION ASSIMILATION EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount Amount Amount Write down of Global receivables $ 21,200 $ $ Restructuring expenses $ 19,327 $ (649) $ 7,292 Acquisition assimilation expense $ 21,380 $ 39,929 $ 3,916 Concurrent with the acquisition of Frontier, we entered into several operating agreements with Global. The write down of the net realizable value of Global Crossing receivables of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 is a result of Globals filing for bankruptcy. We are integrating the Frontier acquisition from Global and have ongoing commercial relationships with Global affiliates. We will reserve a total of $30 million of Global receivables to reflect our best estimate of the net realizable value of receivables incurred from these commercial relationships during 2001 and 2002. We recorded a write down of such receivables in the amount of $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, with the remainder recorded in the first quarter of 2002 for receivables generated after December 31, 2001 and prior to the Global bankruptcy filing on January 28, 2002. Prior to the date of filing we provided ordinary course telecommunications services as well as transitional services to Global. Global has provided us certain customer billing and collection functions as well as other transitional services. These arrangements have continued after the bankruptcy filing. The receivables that were outstanding at the date of Globals bankruptcy filings are subject to potential setoff rights and will be treated as any other general creditor through the bankruptcy process, including through a potential chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The Bankruptcy Court has granted relief to us and other telecommunications companies that provide service to Global by, among other things, directing a shortened payment period with respect to post petition invoices, an expedited court process for post petition defaults in payments by Global, and a priority for post petition expense items over other unsecured debt. These procedures should minimize future economic loss to the company although we cannot guarantee that such losses will not occur. Restructuring expenses of $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 are primarily related to our plan to close our operations support center in Plano, Texas by April 2002 and our Sacramento, California call center by March 2002 and ELIs decision to exit certain long haul markets. These restructurings are a result of our evaluation of our facilities to take advantage of operational and functional synergies. Plano Restructuring In the second quarter of 2001, we approved a plan to close our operations support center in Plano, Texas by April 2002. In connection with this plan, we recorded a pre tax charge of $14.5 million in other operating expenses in 2001. Our objective is to concentrate our resources in areas where we have the most customers, to better serve those customers. We intend to sell our Plano office building. The restructuring resulted in the reduction of 750 employees. We communicated with all affected employees during July 2001. Certain employees will be relocated, others have been offered severance, job training and or outplacement counseling. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $1.7 million was paid and 161 employees were terminated. The restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance benefits, retention earned through December 31, 2001, early lease termination costs and other planning and communication costs. We expect to incur additional costs of approximately $1.4 million through the second quarter of 2002. Sacramento Call Center Restructuring In the fourth quarter of 2001, we approved a plan to close our Sacramento Customer Care Center by the end of March 2002. In connection with this plan, we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $0.7 million in restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2001. We will redirect the call traffic and other work activities to our Kingman, Arizona call center. This restructuring resulted in the reduction of 94 employees. We communicated with all affected employees during November 2001. These costs are expected to be paid in the first quarter 2002. 32 ELI Restructuring In the first half of 2002, ELI intends to redeploy the internet routers, frame relay switches and ATM switches from the Atlanta, Cleveland, Denver, Philadelphia and New York markets to other locations in ELIs network. ELI intends to cease leasing the collocation facilities and off net circuits for the backbone and local loops supporting the service delivery in these markets. It is anticipated that this will lead to $4.2 million of termination fees which have been accrued for but not paid for the year ended December 31, 2001. Restructuring expenses of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 were related to our plan to restructure our corporate office activities of $5.8 million and exit costs at ELI of $1.5 million. In connection with the corporate office plan, we recorded a pre tax charge of $5.8 million in restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 1999. The restructuring resulted in the reduction of 49 corporate employees. All affected employees were communicated with in the early part of November 1999. As of December 31, 2001, approximately $4.4 million has been paid, 42 employees were terminated and 6 employees who were expected to be terminated took other positions within the company. The remaining employee was terminated in January 2002. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we adjusted our original accrual down by $.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and the remaining accrual of $.2 million is included in other current liabilities at December 31, 2001. These costs will be paid in the first quarter 2002. In the third quarter of 1999, ELI announced two strategic decisions that led to $1.5 million in exit costs. On August 24, 1999, ELI announced that it was eliminating its prepaid calling card and videoconferencing products, effective November 1, 1999. This initiative was taken as a result of ELIs decision to focus on its core business strategy. Prepaid calling cards are a high volume, low margin product that ELI determined did not support its strategy of accelerating profitability. On September 1, 1999, ELI announced that it was consolidating its national retail sales efforts in Dallas and closing six retail sales offices in the eastern United States by October 8, 1999. ELI has maintained all of its data points of presence and wholesale sale offices. As a result of both of these decisions, ELI eliminated 63 sales and sales support positions, and incurred charges relating to employee severance and facility shutdown costs. As of December 31, 2000, all costs associated with this decision were paid and no accrual remained. Acquisition assimilation expense of $21.4 million and $39.9 million, in 2001 and 2000, respectively, is related to the completed acquisitions. These expenses represent incremental costs incurred by us in advance of the respective acquisitions which are solely related to preparation for businesses to be acquired and have no relationship with then existing operations, and as a result, have no revenue offset. Costs incurred during 2001 and 2000 were significant due to the unprecedented level of acquisitions. Material components of acquisition expenses include incremental pre staffing and training costs incurred in anticipation of acquisitions, incremental costs associated with the integration of the acquired networks into our existing networks and network operating center, and costs associated with the preparation for the conversion of billing, accounting and plant records. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Income from operations $ 233,042 91% $ 121,801 73% $ 70,360 Income from operations increased $111.2 million, or 91%, in 2001 primarily due to the impact of the Acquisitions and decreased depreciation expense related to our classifying our gas and electric sectors as "assets held for sale" which requires us to cease depreciating these assets. Such depreciation expense would have been an additional $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was partially offset by the write down of our Global Crossing receivables, restructuring expenses and increased ELI losses. Included in operating income is approximately $10.4 million and $21.1 million of operating income for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, from our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations that will not continue since the sales closed on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Income from operations increased $51.4 million, or 73%, in 2000 primarily due to the Acquisitions, decreased ELI operating losses and decreased operating expenses, partially offset by increased acquisition assimilation expense, the settlement of a proceeding with the Louisiana Public Service Commission and increased depreciation expense. Income from operations for 1999 included a $10.4 million USF settlement. 33 INVESTMENT INCOME (LOSS), NET/OTHER LOSS, NET/GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS / MINORITY INTEREST/INTEREST EXPENSE/INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Investment income (loss), net $ (62,408) 1418% $ 4,736 98% $ 243,885 Other loss, net $ (3,133) 126% $ (1,386) 1475% $ (88) Gain on sale of assets $ 139,304 100% $ $ Minority interest $ 100% $ 12,222 47% $ 23,227 Interest expense $(379,326) 102% $(187,366) 57% $(119,675) Income tax expense (benefit) $ (14,805) 8% $ (16,132) 122% $ 74,900 Investment income decreased $67.1 million in 2001 primarily due to the recognition of a $79.0 million loss resulting from a decline in value of our Adelphia investment. The decrease was partially offset by increased income from higher money market balances resulting from the temporary investment of proceeds from debt issuances. Investment income decreased $239.1 million, or 98%, in 2000 primarily due to the $69.5 million gain on the sale of our investment in Centennial Cellular Corp. in January 1999, the $67.6 million gain on the sale of our investment in Century Communication Corp. in October 1999 and the $83.9 million gain on the sale of our investment in the cable joint venture in October 1999. The remaining decrease is primarily due to realized losses of $18.3 million on sales of available for sale securities to partially fund acquisitions. Other loss, net increased $1.7 million, or 126%, in 2001 primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income and the allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). Other loss, net decreased $1.3 million, or 1,475%, in 2000 primarily due to a decrease in AFUDC resulting from our conclusion in the third quarter of 2001 that SFAS 71 was no longer applicable to our ILEC businesses (see "Discontinuation of SFAS 71"). Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2001 represents the gain recognized from the sale of our Louisiana gas operations to Atmos Energy Corporation on July 2, 2001. Minority interest represents the minoritys share of ELIs net loss. Since ELIs public offering, we recorded minority interest on our income statement and reduced minority interest on our balance sheet by the amount of the minority interests share of ELIs losses. As of June 30, 2000, the minority interest on the balance sheet had been reduced to zero, therefore, from that point going forward, we discontinued recording minority interest income on our income statement as there is no obligation for the minority interests to provide additional funding for ELI. Therefore, we are reflecting ELIs entire loss in our consolidated results. Interest expense increased $192.0 million, or 102%, in 2001 primarily due to $94.4 million of interest expense on our $1.75 billion of notes issued in May 2001, $52.3 million of interest expense on our $1.75 billion of notes issued in August 2001, $16.6 million of interest expense on our equity units issued in June, $15.9 million of increased interest expense on our lines of credit, $8.3 million of increased amortization of debt discount expense and a $6.5 million increase in amortization of costs associated with our committed bank credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we had average long term debt outstanding of $4.5 billion compared to $2.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2000. Our composite average borrowing rate paid for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2000 was 49 basis points higher, increasing from 6.85% to 7.34%, due to the impact of higher interest rates on our new borrowings. Interest expense increased $67.7 million, or 57%, in 2000 primarily due to a $24.8 million increase in ELIs interest expense related to increased borrowings and higher interest rates, $17.8 million increase due to an increase in our commercial paper outstanding used to partially and temporarily fund acquisitions and $14.9 million for amortization of costs associated with our committed bank credit facilities. A reduction in capitalized interest of $4.0 million due to lower average capital work in process balances at ELI also contributed to the increase. During the year ended December 31, 2000, we had average long term debt outstanding of $2.6 billion compared to $2.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 1999. Income tax expense (benefit) decreased $1.3 million, or 8%, in 2001 primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss) and the write off of regulatory assets related to our sale of our Louisiana gas operations. The estimated annual effective tax rate for 2001 is 20.4% as compared with an effective tax rate of 32.3% for 2000. Income tax expense (benefit) decreased $91.0 million, or 122%, in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to changes in taxable income and taxes on the gains on the sales of our investments in 1999. The estimated annual effective tax benefit rate for 2000 was 32.3% as compared with an effective tax rate of 34.4% for 1999. 34 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Revenue $ 116,868 11% $ 105,202 3% $ 102,408 Operating income $ 37,211 36% $ 27,415 38% $ 19,887 Net income $ 17,875 53% $ 11,677 48% $ 7,887 Discontinued operations represents the operations of our water/wastewater businesses sold in January 2002. Revenue from discontinued operations increased $11.7 million, or 11%, in 2001 and $2.8 million, or 3%, in 2000 primarily due to increased consumption and customer growth. The 2001 increase is also due to new water sales related to the completion of a multi year $50 million water pipeline project in Illinois in March 2001. This increase of revenue was approximately $8 million. Operating income from discontinued operations increased $9.8 million, or 36%, in 2001 primarily due to customer growth and the completion of a water pipeline project in Illinois in March 2001. Operating income from discontinued operations increased $7.5 million, or 38%, in 2000 primarily due to increased revenue, decreased Y2K expenses, decreased corporate overhead charges and lower payroll costs due to a reduction in the staffing levels of support functions, partially offset by increased depreciation expense due to increased property, plant and equipment. Net income from discontinued operations increased $6.2 million, or 53%, in 2001 and $3.8 million, or 48%, in 2000, primarily due to the respective changes in operating income net of income taxes.

Deregulation of most of our local exchange telephone properties required us to cease application of SFAS 71 in the third quarter, resulting in a non cash extraordinary charge of $43.6 million, net of tax, in our income statement. See discussion in Note 20 of the financial statements. NET INCOME (LOSS) / AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS PER COMMON SHARE ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 1999 Amount % Change Amount % Change Amount Net income (loss) $ (89,682) 216% $ (28,394) 120% $ 144,486 Carrying cost of equity forward contracts 13,650 N/A N/A Available to common shareholders $ (103,332) 264% $ (28,394) 120% $ 144,486 Available to common shareholders per common share $ (0.38) 245% $ (0.11) 120% $ 0.56 35 Net income and net income per share for 2001 were impacted by the following after tax items: the gain from the sale of our Louisiana gas operations of $86.0 million, or 31(cent) per share, the recognition of a loss resulting from the decline in value of our Adelphia investment of $48.8 million, or 18(cent) per share, extraordinary expense of $43.6 million, or 16(cent) per share, the write down of our Global receivables of $13.1 million, or 5(cent) per share, and restructuring charges of $11.9 million, or 4(cent) per share. Increased interest expense also contributed to the decrease in net income as compared to the prior year. Net loss and net loss per share for 2000 were impacted by the following after tax items: assimilation expenses of $24.6 million, or 9(cent) per share, the settlement of a proceeding with the Louisiana Public Service Commission of $18.4 million, or 7(cent) per share, accelerated depreciation to change the useful life of an operating system in the ILEC sector of $7.8 million, or 3(cent) per share, and the impact of the acquisitions of $6.9 million, or 3(cent) per share. Net income and net income per share for 1999 were impacted by the following after tax items: gains on the sales of investments of $136.4 million, or 52(cent) per share, asset impairment charges of $22.3 million, or 9(cent) per share, an executive retirement agreement of $4.1 million, or 2(cent) per share, restructuring charges of $3.6 million, or 1(cent) per share, separation costs of $3.1 million, or 1(cent) per share, accelerated depreciation of $3 million, or 1(cent) per share, and pre acquisition integration costs of $2.4 million, or 1(cent) per share. 1999 net income and net income per share were also impacted by after tax net losses from ELI of $54.1 million, or 21(cent) per share and after tax Y2K costs of $12.2 million, or 5(cent) per share. During 2000, we entered into an equity forward contract for the acquisition of 9,140,000 shares as part of our share repurchase programs. Pursuant to transition accounting rules, commencing December 31, 2000 through June 30, 2001 we were required to report our equity forward contract as a reduction to shareholders equity and a component of temporary equity for the gross settlement amount of the contract ($150,013,000). On June 28, 2001, we entered into a master confirmation agreement that amended the equity forward contract to no longer permit share settlement of the contract. We were required to report the accrued carrying costs as a reduction of net income available to common shareholders. In 2001 we settled the contract by paying the redemption amount of $150,013,000 plus $13,650,000 in associated carrying costs. 36 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity and commodity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks and we are not party to any market risk management agreements. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity and commodity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio and long term debt and capital lease obligations. The long term debt and capital lease obligations include various instruments with various maturities and weighted average interest rates. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, a majority of our borrowings have fixed interest rates and variable rate debt is refinanced when advantageous. Consequently, we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2001, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On December 17, 2001, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, each agreement covering a notional amount of $50 million. Under the terms of both agreements, we make semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed 6.375% rate on the notional amount. Under the terms of one swap, the underlying LIBOR rate is set in advance, while the second agreement utilizes LIBOR reset in arrears. Both swaps terminate on August 15, 2004 and are being accounted for under SFAS 133 as fair value hedges against our 6.375% notes due August 15, 2004. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2001, the fair value of our long term debt and capital lease obligations was estimated to be approximately $6,030.4 million, based on our overall weighted average rate of 7.68% and our overall weighted maturity of approximately 10 years. The weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations has decreased by two years since December 31, 2000. The overall weighted average interest rate applicable to our obligations has increased by approximately 73 basis points since December 31, 2000. A hypothetical increase of 77 basis points (10% of our overall weighted average borrowing rate) would result in an approximate $297.2 million decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in equity prices relate primarily to the equity portion of our investment portfolio. The equity portion of our investment portfolio includes marketable equity securities of media and telecommunications companies. Sensitivity analysis of equity price exposure At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio was estimated to be $139.2 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted market prices would result in an approximate $13.9 million decrease in the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio. 37 Commodity Price Exposure We purchase monthly gas future contracts, from time to time, to manage well defined commodity price fluctuations, caused by weather and other unpredictable factors, associated with our commitments to deliver natural gas to customers at fixed prices. Customers pay for gas service based upon prices that are defined by a tariff. A tariff is an agreement with the public utility commission that determines the price that we will charge to the customer. Fluctuations in gas prices are routinely handled through a pricing mechanism called the purchase gas adjustor (PGA). The PGA allows for a process whereby any price change from the agreed upon tariff will be settled as a pass through to the customer. As a result, if gas prices increase, the PGA will increase and pass more costs on to the customer. If gas prices decrease, the PGA will decrease and refunds will be provided to the customer. This commodity activity relates to our gas businesses and is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In all instances we take physical delivery of the gas supply purchased or contracted for. These gas future contracts and gas supply contracts are considered derivative instruments as defined by SFAS 133. However, such contracts are excluded from the provisions of SFAS 133 since they are purchases made in the normal course of business and not for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2001, we do not have any gas future contracts. Disclosure of limitations of sensitivity analysis Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value. This analysis incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2001. It does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate exposure with respect to our market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and the fluctuation of interest rates and quoted market prices. 38
