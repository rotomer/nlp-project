Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, words such as "believes", "anticipates", "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, any of the following possibilities: * Changes in the number of our access lines; * The effects of competition from wireless, other wireline carriers (through Unbundled Network Elements (UNE), Unbundled Network Elements Platform (UNEP) or otherwise), high speed cable modems and cable telephony; * The effects of general and local economic conditions on our revenues; * Our ability to effectively manage and otherwise monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality; * Our ability to divest our remaining public utilities services businesses and the effect of the timing of the divestitures on the capital expenditures we make with respect to such businesses; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms attractive to our customers, and our ability to sell enhanced and data services; * Our ability to manage our operating expenses, capital expenditures and reduce our debt; * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * The effects of bankruptcies in the telecommunications industry which could result in higher network access costs and potential bad debts; * The effects of technological changes, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; * The effects of increased pension and retiree medical expenses and related funding requirements; * The effects of changes in regulation in the telecommunications industry as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state legislation and regulation, including changes in access charges and subsidy payments; * The effect of restructuring of portions of the telecommunications market; * The effects of possible state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; * Our ability to successfully renegotiate expiring union contracts, including the contract covering the Communications Workers of America members in Rochester that is scheduled to expire in January 2004; and 15 * The effects of more general factors, including changes in economic conditions; changes in the capital markets; changes in industry conditions; changes in our credit ratings; and changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators. You should consider these important factors in evaluating any statement in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2002, we used cash flows from continuing operations, the proceeds from the sale of utility properties, cash and cash equivalents and investment balances to fund capital expenditures, interest payments and debt repayments. On January 15, 2002, we completed the sale of our water and wastewater operations for $859.1 million in cash plus the assumption by the buyer of $122.5 million of our debt and other liabilities. On November 1, 2002 we completed the sale of Kauai Electric division for $215.0 million in cash. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $393.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, our actual capital expenditures were $468.7 million, including $288.8 million for the ILEC segment, $12.0 million for the ELI segment (excluding the purchase of equipment previously under lease for $110.0 million in cash), $39.7 million for the public utilities services segments and $18.2 million for general capital expenditures. We have budgeted approximately $333.6 million for our 2003 capital projects; including $275.0 million for the ILEC segment, $13.4 million for the ELI segment and $45.2 million for the public utilities segment. In the ordinary course of business, capital expenditures for the public utilities segment would increase the amount of assets that would be reflected on the balance sheet. However, most of the capital expenditures with respect to our public utilities segment during 2003 will be expensed as incurred instead of capitalized (see "Loss on Impairment" below and Note 28). During 1995, ELI entered into a construction agency agreement and an operating lease agreement in connection with the construction of certain network facilities. On April 30, 2002, ELI purchased the facilities at the lease termination for $110.0 million in cash. Citizens had guaranteed all of ELIs obligations under this operating lease and provided the funds for the purchase. We have an available shelf registration of $825.6 million and we have available lines of credit with financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $805.0 million. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our credit ratings, and are 0.25% per annum as of December 31, 2002. The expiration date for the facilities is October 24, 2006. During the term of the facilities we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds. As of December 31, 2002, there were no outstanding advances under these facilities. Tender Offer On May 16, 2002, we commenced a tender offer, at $0.70 per share, for all of the publicly held Class A common shares of ELI that we did not already own. The tender offer expired on June 17, 2002, at which time the shares tendered, combined with the ELI shares already owned by us, represented approximately 95.5% of total outstanding ELI Class A shares. On June 20, 2002, we completed a short form merger in which ELI became our wholly owned subsidiary and each share of common stock not tendered was converted into a right to receive $0.70 in cash without interest. The total cost (including fees and expenses) of the tender was approximately $6.8 million. Debt Reduction For the year ended December 31, 2002, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $1.06 billion of debt. We intend to continue to reduce debt balances from the proceeds from the sale of our public service utilities and cash flows from continuing operations and may use current cash and cash equivalent balances. If the sale of our Arizona utility businesses to UniSource is completed, the sale agreement requires us to promptly redeem $111.8 million principal amount of industrial revenue bonds. On January 7, 2002, we redeemed at par two of our outstanding 1991 series of industrial development revenue bonds, the $20.0 million 7.15% Mohave series and the $10.1 million 7.15% Santa Cruz series. 16 On January 31, 2002, we repaid approximately $76.9 million principal amount of debt from the Rural Utilities Service, Rural Telephone Bank and the Federal Financing Bank. We paid a premium of $0.5 million on these redemptions. On March 27, 2002, we repaid $40.0 million of Frontier 7.51% Medium Term Notes at maturity. On May 1, 2002, we redeemed at par six of our outstanding variable rate industrial development revenue bond series aggregating approximately $20.3 million in principal amount. On June 27, 2002, we redeemed at par $24.8 million principal amount of our 7.05% Mohave Industrial Development Revenue Refunding Bonds due August 1, 2020. On July 15, 2002, we redeemed at par three of our outstanding fixed and variable rate industrial development revenue bond series aggregating approximately $14.9 million in principal amount. On August 7, 2002, we redeemed at par one of our outstanding variable rate industrial development revenue bond series totaling $5.5 million in principal amount. Following the completion of the merger with ELI, we repaid and terminated the entire $400.0 million outstanding under ELIs committed revolving line of credit with a syndicate of commercial banks. During the last three quarters of 2002, we executed a series of purchases in the open market of a number of our outstanding notes and debentures. The aggregate principal amount of notes and debentures purchased was $106.9 million and the purchases generated a pre tax gain from the early extinguishment of debt at a discount of approximately $6.0 million. We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market. During December 2002, we completed a tender offer with respect to our 6.80% Debentures due 2026 (puttable at par in 2003) and ELIs 6.05% Guaranteed Notes due 2004. As a result of the tender, $82.3 million and $259.4 million, respectively, of these securities were purchased and retired at a premium of $12.8 million in excess of the principal amount of the securities purchased. Interest Rate Management In order to manage our interest rate risk exposure, we entered into five interest swap agreements in 2001 and 2002 with investment grade financial institutions. Each agreement covered a notional amount of $50.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements, we make semi annual, floating interest rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. There are two interest rate swap agreements that were executed in 2001 that receive a 6.375% fixed rate until the swaps termination date of August 15, 2004, and there are three swaps executed in 2002 that receive an 8.500% fixed rate until their termination date of May 15, 2006. The underlying variable rate on the swaps is set either in advance, in arrears or, as in the case of one agreement, based on each periods daily average six month LIBOR. In connection with these swaps, the Company entered into a series of supplemental rate agreements which had the effect of setting the floating rate portion of the swaps in advance of the contractually agreed upon rate determination date. The net effect of the two 2001 interest rate swaps and supplemental rate agreements was to reduce the effective interest rate on $100.0 million of fixed rate debt from 6.375% to 3.665% during 2002. The net effect of the three 2002 swaps and supplemental rate agreements was to reduce the effective interest rate on $150.0 million of fixed rate debt from 8.500% to 6.864% through November 15, 2002, the latest rate reset date. All swaps and associated supplemental rate agreements are accounted for under SFAS 133 as fair value hedges. 17 Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002 is as follows: Less than After ($ in thousands) Total 1 year(2) 2 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Long term debt (See Note 10) (1) $5,476,272 $ 58,911 $392,390 $885,023 $4,139,948 Operating leases (See Note 28) 157,975 26,790 41,152 34,578 55,455 Long term contracts (See Note 28) 388,752 100,812 117,591 44,599 125,750 Equity Providing Preferred Income Convertible Securities (EPPICS)(See Note 16) 201,250 201,250 Total contractual cash obligations $6,224,249 $186,513 $551,133 $964,200 $4,522,403 (1) Includes the debt portion of the equity units ($460.0 million) and the net present value of payments under capital leases ($135.2 million). (2) If the sale of our Arizona utility business to UniSource is completed, we will redeem $111.8 million principal amount of long term debt. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facility agreements are of a general nature, and do not currently impose significant financial performance criteria on us. These general covenants include the timely and punctual payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends by us either by contract, rule or regulation. The principal financial performance covenant under our $805.0 million credit facilities and our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC) requires the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $1.5 billion. These facilities define "net worth" as shareholders equity plus equity units plus mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. Under the RTFC loan, in the event that our credit rating from either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors declines below investment grade (Baa3/BBB , respectively), we would also be required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1 or greater and a leverage ratio of 6.00 to 1 or lower. We are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. At December 31, 2002 the amount of our net worth as calculated pursuant to the credit facilities and the RTFC loan facility was $1.83 billion. In future periods, we may incur a reduction in shareholders equity as a result of certain pension matters described under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" or for other reasons. Although the potential amount of future reductions cannot currently be determined with certainty and assessments of the potential amounts require considerable assumptions, we believe that we will remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Acquisitions In 1999 and 2000 we entered into several agreements to acquire telephone access lines. These transactions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired properties have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition of each property. In 2000, we acquired from Verizon Communications Inc. approximately 317,500 telephone access lines for $948.2 million in cash, and we acquired from Qwest approximately 17,000 telephone access lines in North Dakota for approximately $38.0 million in cash. On June 29, 2001, we purchased Frontier for approximately $3,373.0 million in cash. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture for our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. During 2001 we sold two of our natural gas operations and in 2002 we sold all of our water and wastewater treatment operations and one electric business (see Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements). 18 On January 15, 2002, we sold our water and wastewater services operations for $859.1 million in cash and $122.5 million in assumed debt and other liabilities. On October 29, 2002, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our Arizona gas and electric divisions to UniSource Energy Corporation for $230.0 million in cash ($220.0 million if we close by July 28, 2003) subject to adjustments specified in the agreements (see Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The transaction, which is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals, is expected to close during the second half of 2003. On October 31, 2002, we completed the sale of approximately 4,000 telephone access lines in North Dakota for approximately $9.7 million in cash. On November 1, 2002, we completed the sale of our Kauai electric division for $215.0 million in cash. On December 19, 2002, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Hawaiian gas division to K 1 USA Ventures, Inc. for $115.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments under the terms of the agreement. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals, is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2003. Currently, we do not have an agreement to sell our Vermont electric division, but we continue to actively pursue a buyer. All our gas and electric assets (including Arizona gas and electric and Hawaii gas) and their related liabilities are classified as "assets held for sale" and "liabilities related to assets held for sale," respectively. These assets have been written down to our best estimate of the net realizable value upon sale (see Note 4 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During the third quarter of 2002, we recognized a non cash pre tax impairment loss on these assets of $417.4 million. As discussed below under "Loss on Impairment" we will record additional impairment losses during 2003. Discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations and the gain on sale of the water/wastewater properties sold in January 2002 including allocated interest expense for the periods presented. Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations based on the outstanding debt specifically identified with this business. Discontinuation of SFAS 71 Prior to the 2000 and 2001 acquisitions, our incumbent local exchange telephone properties had been predominantly regulated following a cost of service/rate of return approach. Accordingly, we applied the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Currently, pricing for a majority of our revenues in our previously existing incumbent local exchange telephone properties is based upon price cap plans that limit prices to changes in general inflation and estimates of productivity for the industry at large or upon market pricing rather than on the specific costs of operating our business, a requirement for the application of SFAS 71. These trends in the deregulation of pricing and the introduction of competition are expected to continue. We intend to operate all of our properties as competitive enterprises, to meet competitive entry and maximize revenue by providing a broad range of products and services, such as data services. Many of these future services will not be regulated, further increasing the percentage of our revenue provided by our networks that is not based upon historical cost/rate of return regulation. In the third quarter of 2001, we concluded based on the factors mentioned above, that the provisions of SFAS 71 were no longer applicable to our incumbent local exchange telephone properties (properties we owned prior to the acquisitions in 2000 and 2001). As discussed further in Note 24 to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2001 we recorded a non cash extraordinary charge of $43.6 million net of tax in our statement of operations, to write off regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet in the past. Based upon our evaluation of the pace of technological change that is estimated to occur in certain components of our rural telephone networks, we concluded that minor modifications in our asset lives were required for the major network technology assets. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 101 and SFAS 121, we performed a test of the impairment of the property, plant and equipment accounts for our properties discontinuing SFAS 71 and based upon our expectations of future changes in sales volumes and prices and the anticipated rate of entry of additional competition into our markets, we concluded that an asset impairment was not warranted. 19 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, employee benefit plans, income taxes and contingencies, among others. Our estimate of anticipated losses related to telecommunications bankruptcies is a "critical accounting estimate." We have significant on going normal course business relationships with many telecom providers, some of which have filed for bankruptcy. We generally reserve approximately 95% of the net outstanding pre bankruptcy balances owed to us and believe that our estimate of the net realizable value of the amounts owed to us by bankrupt entities is appropriate. We believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a "critical accounting estimate". With respect to ELI, the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions about future revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures over the life of the property, plant and equipment (generally 5 to 15 years) as well as the probability of occurrence of the various scenarios and appropriate discount rates. Managements assumptions about ELIs future revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as the probability of occurrence of these various scenarios require significant judgment because the CLEC industry is changing and because actual revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to do so in the future. The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Although we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible or intangible assets will occur in the near term, rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results. Our depreciation expense of the ELI segment will decrease substantially in future periods as a result of the impairment write down. With respect to our remaining gas and electric properties, our estimate is based upon expected future sales prices of these properties. (See Notes 4 and 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements). In the third quarter 2002, we recognized a non cash pre tax loss on impairment of $656.7 million for the impairment of long lived assets in the ELI sector and a total of $417.4 million of non cash pre tax losses on impairment in the gas and electric sectors. We determined that we may not be able to recover the previously recorded carrying value of ELIs property, plant, and equipment and therefore recorded the impairment charge accordingly. The gas and electric impairment is associated with the proposed sales of our Arizona gas and electric and Hawaiian gas properties at a price that was less than the book carrying value. We have also written down the value of our remaining utility to our estimate of net realizable sale price. Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, our reporting unit is the ILEC segment. In determining fair value during 2002 we utilized two tests. One test utilized recent trading prices for completed ILEC acquisitions of similarly situated properties. A second test utilized current trading values for the Companys publicly traded common stock. We reviewed the results of both tests for consistency to insure that our conclusions were appropriate. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our tests determined that fair values exceeded book value. Unless economic conditions change significantly (i.e. we experience unanticipated declines in revenue, and or declines in both our stock price and ILEC property values) we do not believe that a charge for impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the near future. Our estimates of pension expense, other post retirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are "critical accounting estimates". Our pension and other post retirement benefits expenses are based upon a set of assumptions that include projections of future interest rates and asset returns. Actual results may vary from these estimates. If future market conditions cause either a decline in interest rates used to value our pension plan liabilities or reductions to the value of our pension plan assets we potentially could incur additional charges to our shareholders equity at the end of 2003. Based upon market conditions existing at the end of February 2003, an additional charge of approximately $30 $35 million would be required at the end of 2003 should market conditions remain unchanged. 20 Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment. We have no intangibles with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill and trade name. The amortization of goodwill and trade name ceased upon adoption of the statement on January 1, 2002. We were required to test for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives as of January 1, 2002 and at least annually thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss at January 1, 2002 is recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations. As a result of our adoption of SFAS 142, we recognized a transitional impairment loss related to ELI of $39.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in the first quarter of 2002. We annually examine the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangibles with estimated useful lives to determine whether there are any impairment losses and have determined for the year ended December 31, 2002 that there was no impairment. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over those lives and be reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal or Long Lived Assets." During the first quarter of 2002, we reassessed the useful life of our intangible assets with estimated useful lives and determined that no change was required. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 is discussed in Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and reported as a liability. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of SFAS 143. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS 121, for impairment of long lived assets held and used and for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2002. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." This statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. The statement requires gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" which provides guidance for distinguishing transactions that are part of an entitys recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. We adopted SFAS 145 in the second quarter of 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized $32.3 million of gains from early debt retirement as other income. There were no similar types of retirements in 2001. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than on the date of commitment to an exit plan. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 146. 21 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the expanded disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148. (b) Results of Operations REVENUE ILEC revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance and data services. Such services are provided under either a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at a tariffed rate and is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. CLEC revenue is generated through local, long distance, data and long haul services. These services are primarily provided under a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at agreed upon rates and are not dependent upon significant judgments by management with the exception of the determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts and realizability of reciprocal compensation. CLEC usage based revenue includes amounts determined under reciprocal compensation agreements. While this revenue is governed by specific contracts with the counterparty, management defers recognition of portions of such revenue until realizability is assured. Revenue earned from long haul contracts is recognized over the term of the related agreement. Revenue from the provision of public utility services are recognized based on usage without significant judgments made by management with the exception of a provision for uncollectible accounts. Consolidated revenue increased $212.3 million, or 9%, in 2002 and $654.6 million, or 36%, in 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to $420.5 million of increased telecommunications revenue, largely due to the impact of the Frontier acquisition on June 29, 2001, partially offset by $195.0 million of decreased gas revenue largely due to the disposition of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations and the disposition of the Kauai electric division. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions in the ILEC sector as well as the pass through to customers of the increased cost of gas offset by the disposition of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations.

Historically, rural local telephone companies experienced steady growth in access lines because of positive demographic trends, steady rural local economies and little competition. In recent quarters many rural local telephone companies (including us) have experienced a loss of access lines primarily because of difficult economic conditions, increased competition from competitive wireline providers (including from Unbundled Network Elements), from wireless providers and from cable companies (currently with respect to broadband but which may in the future expand to cable telephony), and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add DSL or cable modem service. We lost approximately 37,000 access lines during 2002 but added approximately 41,100 DSL subscribers during this period. The loss of lines during 2002 was equally weighted between residential and non residential customers. The non residential line losses were principally in Rochester, while the residential losses were throughout our markets. We expect to continue to lose access lines during 2003. A continued decrease in access lines, combined with continuing difficult economic conditions and increased competition, may cause our revenues to decrease in 2003. 22 Prior to 2002, we reported subscriber line charges (SLC) in both the access and local revenue categories. Beginning in the second quarter 2002, all SLC revenue is reported in the local services category. All prior periods have been conformed to this presentation. The average amount of SLC that was previously reported in access services is $22.9 million per quarter. Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $108.8 million, or 19%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $92.4 million. Increases in subsidies of $20.3 million and non switched access revenue of $12.5 million due to higher circuit sales were partially offset by a decrease in switched access revenue of $16.5 million primarily from the effect of tariff rate reductions effective as of July 1, 2002. Our subsidy revenues in 2003 are expected to be slightly lower than 2002. Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $182.1 million, or 48%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to additional revenues of $159.1 million resulting from acquisitions. Growth in minutes of use, special access and subsidies revenue contributed $3.1 million, $17.9 million and $20.0 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by $6.5 million from the effect of the FCCs CALLS mandate which reduced access charges paid by long distance companies and $7.3 million in rate decreases in effect as of July 1, 2001. Access services revenue in 2001 also includes a reclassification of $13.9 million in revenue that was classified as local services revenue in 2000. Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $196.6 million, or 29%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $184.8 million. Increases of $8.0 million in enhanced services for feature packages and $12.5 million from SLC were partially offset by an $8.6 million decrease resulting from rate changes and line losses. Although we continue to increase our penetration of enhanced services, in current economic conditions the rate of increase in sales is lower than in prior periods and we expect this trend to continue. Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $277.6 million, or 70%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to acquisitions, which contributed $260.9 million and growth in enhanced services of $8.1 million. Local services revenue in 2001 also reflects a reduction for the reclassification of $13.9 million in revenue that was classified as access revenue in 2000. Long distance and data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $97.2 million, or 47%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $72.4 million, $13.7 million growth related to data and dedicated circuits and growth in long distance services of $11.0 million. The rate of increases in our data and long distance revenues has been slowing recently because of economic conditions and intense competition in some of our markets. We expect these factors will continue to affect our long distance and data services revenues during 2003. Long distance and data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $101.6 million, or 95%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions of $78.2 million, principally the long distance and data revenue associated with Frontier, which contributed $74.1 million. Growth in data and dedicated circuits of $14.9 million and growth in long distance services of $7.7 million also contributed to the increase. Directory services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $32.0 million, or 44%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $30.0 million and growth in yellow pages advertising revenue of $2.0 million. Directory services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $35.0 million, or 93%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, which contributed $33.2 million, and growth of $1.8 million. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $34.3 million, or 45%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $32.8 million. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $34.0 million, or 82%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions of $38.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous revenue categories. ELI revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 decreased $48.3 million, or 22% and $17.4 million, or 7%, respectively, primarily due to lower reciprocal compensation minutes and prices, a decline in Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) services due to less demand from internet service providers and lower demand and prices for long haul services. The decrease in 2001 was also attributable to the expiration of a material data services contract in February 2001. ELI has experienced eight consecutive quarters of declining revenue. 23 GAS AND ELECTRIC REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Gas revenue $ 216,517 $ (195,017) 47% $ 411,534 $ 36,783 10% $ 374,751 Electric revene $ 214,831 $ (13,184) 6% $ 228,015 $ 4,943 2% $ 223,072 Gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $195.0 million, or 47%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations partially offset by higher purchased gas costs passed on to consumers. Gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $36.8 million, or 10%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to higher purchased gas costs passed on to customers and increased consumption partially offset by decreased revenue due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations. Included in gas revenue for 2001 and 2000 is approximately $218.8 million and $232.3 million, respectively, of revenue from our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations that ceased upon the sale of those operations on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Under tariff provisions, the cost of our gas purchases are primarily passed on to customers. Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $13.2 million, or 6%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale of our Kauai electric division partially offset by increased unit sales and the effect of a rate increase approved in Vermont on July 15, 2002. Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $4.9 million, or 2%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to customer growth and increased consumption due to warmer weather conditions. Included in electric revenue for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is approximately $76.2 million, $94.3 million and $95.1 million, respectively, of revenue for our Kauai electric operation that ceased upon its sale on November 1, 2002. Under tariff provisions, the cost of our electric energy and fuel oil purchases are primarily passed on to customers.

Network access expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $55.9 million, or 40%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and increased circuit expense associated with additional data product introductions partially offset by a reduction in long distance access expense related to rate changes in the ILEC sector and reduced network access expenses at ELI. Gas purchased for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $159.1 million, or 56%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations partially offset by an increase in the cost of gas due to higher commodity pricing. Gas purchased for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $52.5 million, or 23%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to higher purchased gas costs partially offset by decreased gas purchased due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations. Included in gas purchased for 2001 and 2000 is approximately $173.3 million and $151.4 million, respectively, of gas purchased by our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations that ceased upon the sale of those operations on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $4.7 million, or 4%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale on November 1, 2002 of Kauai electric partially offset by increased purchased power costs. Included in electric energy and fuel oil purchased for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is approximately $27.5 million, $37.9 million and $37.9 million, respectively, of electricity purchased by our Kauai electric operation that ceased upon its sale on November 1, 2002. 24 Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $9.3 million, or 8%, as compared with prior year period primarily due to higher purchased power prices, customer growth and increased consumption due to warmer weather conditions. Gas, electric energy and fuel oil purchased excludes amounts deferred for future recovery in rates. In Arizona, power costs charged by our supplier were in excess of the rates we charged our customers by approximately $123.6 million through December 31, 2002. We believe that we are allowed to recover these charges from ratepayers through the Purchase Power Fuel Adjustment clause that was approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission and has been in place for several years. However, in an attempt to limit "rate shock" to our customers, we requested in September 2001 that our unrecovered power costs, plus interest, be recovered over a seven year period. As a result, we deferred these costs on the balance sheet in anticipation of recovery through the regulatory process. This balance was effectively reduced by the public service impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2002 which reduced the net assets of these businesses to their estimated sale value (See Note 4 to Consolidated Financial Statements). In January 2003, the Commission agreed to consolidate this matter with the application for approval of the sale of our Arizona electric property. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Operating expenses $ 762,053 $ 22,931 3% $ 739,122 $ 101,919 16% $ 637,203 Taxes other than income taxes 131,258 15,448 13% 115,810 15,709 16% 100,101 Sales and marketing 109,044 12,266 13% 96,778 22,156 30% 74,622 $1,002,355 $ 50,645 5% $ 951,710 $ 139,784 17% $ 811,926 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $22.9 million, or 3%, as compared with prior year period primarily due to increased operating expenses related to the full year impact of Frontier of $149.9 million partially offset by increased operating efficiencies and a reduction of personnel in the ILEC and ELI sectors, and decreased operating expenses in the gas sector due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. The increase was also offset by the fact that there were no acquisition assimilation costs in 2002 compared to $21.4 million of such costs in 2001. We routinely review our operations, personnel and facilities to achieve greater efficiencies. These reviews may result in reductions in personnel and an increase in severance costs. Included in operating expenses is pension expense. In future periods, if the value of our pension assets decline and or projected benefit costs increase, we may have increased pension expenses. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our pension expense will increase from $4.3 million in 2002 to approximately $13.0 $15.0 million in 2003 and that a contribution to our pension plans will be required in 2003 in an amount currently estimated at $16.0 $18.0 million. In addition, as medical costs increase the costs of our retiree medical obligations also increase. Our retiree medical costs for 2002 were $15.1 million and our current estimate for 2003 is approximately $15 $16 million. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $101.9 million, or 16%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. The increase was partially offset by decreased operating expenses at ELI primarily due to a reduction in personnel, decreased operating expenses in the gas sector primarily due to the sale of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations and a decrease in compensation expense related to variable stock plans. In future periods, compensation expense related to variable stock plans may be materially affected by our stock price. A $1.00 change in our stock price impacts compensation expense by approximately $1.0 million. There was no material impact for the year ended December 31, 2002. Taxes other than income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $15.4 million, or 13%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $25.6 million partially offset by decreased payroll taxes in the ILEC sector related to workforce reductions and decreased taxes in the gas sector due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Taxes other than income for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $15.7 million, or 16%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. 25 Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $12.3 million, or 13%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $22.2 million, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing in the ELI sector of $10.0 million, primarily due to a reduction in personnel and related costs. Sales and marketing expenses for year ended December 31, 2001 increased $22.2 million, or 30%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and increased telemarketing costs in the telecommunications sector. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Depreciation expense $ 630,113 $ 141,156 29% $ 488,957 $ 118,838 32% $ 370,119 Amortization expense 125,409 (17,970) 13% 143,379 125,891 720% 17,488 $ 755,522 $ 123,186 19% $ 632,336 $ 244,729 63% $ 387,607 Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $141.2 million, or 29%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $82.6 million and increased depreciation of $35.6 million at ELI. The increase at ELI was primarily due to the purchase of $110.0 million of previously leased facilities in April 2002 and changes in our estimates of the depreciable lives as of June 2002 offset by a decrease related to the ELI impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2002. As a result of the ELI impairment, we expect 2003 depreciation and amortization expense to decline 10% 15%. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $118.8 million, or 32%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the impact of acquisitions of $119.1 million and $22.0 million of accelerated depreciation related to the change in useful lives of our accounting and human resource systems and our Plano, Texas office building, furniture and fixtures. Higher property, plant and equipment balances in the telecommunications and ELI sectors also contributed to the increase. The increases were partially offset by decreased depreciation expense related to our classifying our gas and electric sectors as "assets held for sale" which requires us to cease depreciating these assets. Such depreciation expense would have been an additional $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase is also offset by $17.4 million in the prior year period of accelerated depreciation related to the change in useful life of an operating system in the telecommunications sector. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $18.0 million, or 13%, as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the fact that we ceased amortization of goodwill and trade name related to our previous acquisitions as of January 1, 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." As a result of ELIs adoption of SFAS 142, we recognized a transitional impairment loss of $39.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in the first quarter of 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001 amortization expense included $91.2 million of goodwill and trade name amortization. This decrease was offset by the impact of additional amortization of customer base of Frontier of $47.6 million and $24.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $125.9 million as compared to prior year period primarily due to amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. RESERVE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS BANKRUPTCIES / RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Reserve for telecommunications bankruptcies $ 10,880 $ (10,320) 49% $ 21,200 $ 21,200 100% $ Restructuring and other expenses $ 37,186 $ 17,859 92% $ 19,327 $ 19,976 3078% $ (649) 26 During the second quarter 2002, we reserved approximately $21.6 million of trade receivables with WorldCom as a result of WorldComs filing for bankruptcy. These receivables were generated as a result of providing ordinary course telecommunications services. The $21.6 million charge was partially offset by reversals in our Global reserve as discussed below. Concurrent with the acquisition of Frontier, we entered into several operating agreements with Global. We have ongoing commercial relationships with Global affiliates. We reserved a total of $29.0 million of Global receivables to reflect our best estimate of the net realizable value of receivables incurred from these commercial relationships during 2001 and 2002 as a result of Globals filing for bankruptcy. We recorded a write down of such receivables in the amount of $7.8 million in the first quarter 2002 and $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. In 2002, as the result of a settlement agreement with Global, we reversed $17.9 million of our previous reserve of the net realizable value of these receivables. Prior to the date of Globals bankruptcy filing, we provided ordinary course telecommunications services as well as transitional services to Global. Global has provided us certain customer billing and collection functions as well as other transitional services. Although some of these arrangements have continued after the bankruptcy filing, we are in the process of changing some services and functions to provide them ourselves. The Bankruptcy Court has granted relief to us and other telecommunications companies that provide service to Global by, among other things, directing a shortened payment period with respect to post petition invoices, an expedited court process for post petition defaults in payments by Global, and a priority for post petition expense items over other unsecured debt. These procedures should minimize future economic loss to us although we cannot guarantee that additional losses will not occur. Restructuring and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily consist of $33.0 million related to reductions in personnel at our telecommunications operations, costs that were spent at both our Plano, Texas facility and at other locations as a result of transitioning functions and jobs, and $6.8 million related to our tender offer in June 2002 for all of the ELI common shares that we did not already own. These costs were partially offset by a $2.8 million reversal of a 2001 ELI accrual discussed below. Plano Restructuring Pursuant to a plan adopted in the third quarter of 2001, we closed our operations support center in Plano, Texas in August 2002. In connection with this plan, we recorded a pre tax charge of $14.6 million in the second half of 2001, $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2002 and we adjusted our accrual down by $0.1 million and $0.6 million in the second and third quarter of 2002, respectively. Our objective is to concentrate our resources in areas where we have the most customers, to better serve those customers. We sold our Plano office building in 2003. The restructuring resulted in the termination of 750 employees. We communicated with all affected employees during July 2001. Certain employees were relocated whereas others were offered severance, job training and or outplacement counseling. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $14.7 million had been paid and all affected employees had been terminated. The restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance benefits, retention payments earned through December 31, 2002, and other planning and communication costs. Sacramento Call Center Restructuring In April 2002, we closed our Sacramento Customer Care Center. In connection with this closing, we recorded a pre tax charge of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, and $0.1 million and $9,000 in the first and second quarters of 2002, respectively. We redirected the call traffic and other work activities to our Kingman, Arizona call center. This restructuring resulted in the elimination of 98 employees. We communicated with all affected employees during November 2001. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $0.8 million was paid, all affected employees were terminated and no accrual remained. ELI Restructuring In the first half of 2002, ELI redeployed the internet routers, frame relay switches and ATM switches from the Atlanta, Cleveland, Denver, Philadelphia and New York markets to other locations in ELIs network. ELI ceased leasing the collocation facilities and off net circuits for the backbone and local loops supporting the service delivery in these markets. It was anticipated that this would lead to $4.2 million of termination fees which were accrued for but not paid at December 31, 2001. During 2002, ELI adjusted its original accrual down by $2.8 million due to the favorable settlements of termination charges for off net circuit agreements. As of December 31, 2002, $1.4 million has been paid and no accrual remained. 27 LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT ($ in thousands) 2002 2001 2000 Amount Amount Amount Loss on impairment $1,074,058 $ $ In the third quarter 2002, we recognized non cash pre tax impairment losses of $656.7 million related to property, plant and equipment in the ELI sector and $417.4 million related to the gas and electric sector assets held for sale. Our assessment of impairment for ELI was a result of continued losses at ELI and continued actual revenue declines in excess of projected revenue declines. The gas and electric sector impairments are associated with the proposed sale of our Arizona and Hawaiian gas and electric properties at prices that are less than the previous carrying values and the write down of our remaining utility to our estimate of net realizable sales price. Previously, we believed that the net realizable value of these properties was equal to or above their carrying values. However, as a result of market conditions, and the desire to complete the divestiture process quickly in order to focus on our core telecommunications operations and raise money to further reduce debt, in the third quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to accept proceeds less than carrying values rather than continue to market these properties for higher prices (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above). We expect to incur additional impairment losses during 2003 with respect to our public utility properties. These properties are carried at our estimates of net realizable values. Under the terms of the definitive agreements relating to the sale of our Arizona and Hawaiian properties, most of the capital expenditures we will make during 2003 for these properties will not be recovered. As a result, the amount of these expenditures (currently estimated at $28 million through the expected closing dates) will be expensed as incurred and not capitalized. These expenditures are of a normal recurring nature and are necessary to provide safe, reliable utility service to customers. We generally do not enter into firm, committed contracts for such activities. If the closing dates for the sales of our Arizona and Hawaiian properties actually occur later than the currently expected dates, the actual amount of capital expenditures expensed will exceed this estimate.

(Adelphia), an increase of $16.3 million compared to the loss of $79.0 million recorded on our Adelphia investment in 2001. As of June 30, 2002, we had written this investment down to zero, and therefore we have no additional exposure related to the market value of Adelphia stock. We also recognized during 2002 a loss of $16.4 million resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in D & E Communications, Inc. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $67.1 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the recognition of a $79.0 million loss resulting from a decline in value of our Adelphia investment. The decrease was partially offset by increased income from higher money market balances resulting from the temporary investment of proceeds from debt issuances. 28 Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $18.9 million as compared to prior year period primarily due to $26.3 million of income from the settlement of certain retained liabilities at less than face value, which are associated with customer advances for construction from our disposed water properties. During 2002, we executed a series of purchases in the open market of our outstanding notes and debentures that generated a pre tax gain from the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.0 million, which also contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by the $12.8 million cost for a tender offer completed in December 2002 with respect to our 6.80% Debentures due 2026 (puttable at par in 2003) and ELIs 6.05% Guaranteed Notes due 2004. Other loss, net increased $1.7 million in 2001 primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous income and capitalized interest. Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 represents the gain recognized from the sale of our Kauai electric division on November 1, 2002 as well as an adjustment of the gain on the 2001 sale of our Louisiana gas operation. Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2001 represents the initial gain on the sale of the Louisiana gas operation to Atmos Energy Corporation on July 2, 2001. The gain recognized on our water sale is classified in discontinued operations. Minority interest represents the former minority shareholders share of ELIs net loss. Subsequent to ELIs public offering, we recorded minority interest on our income statement and reduced minority interest on our balance sheet by the amount of the former minority interests share of ELIs losses. As of June 30, 2000, the minority interest on the balance sheet had been reduced to zero, therefore, from that point going forward, we discontinued recording minority interest income on our statement of operations. Interest expense for 2002 increased compared to 2001 primarily because of the full year impact of $3.5 billion of notes, $460.0 million of equity units and $200.0 million of Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative notes issued during 2001 to refinance debt incurred in connection with our acquisitions, and higher amortization of debt issuance costs. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of bank debt and repurchases of debt described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Reduction." During the year ended December 31, 2002, we had average long term debt outstanding excluding our equity units of $5.2 billion compared to $4.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2001. Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001 was 53 basis points higher, increasing from 7.34% to 7.87% due to the impact of higher interest rates as a result of our refinancing our variable rate debt with fixed rate long term debt. Interest expense increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily because of the issuance of the securities described in the preceding paragraph, borrowings under bank facilities and higher amortization of debt issuance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we had average long term debt outstanding excluding our equity units of $4.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2000. Our composite average borrowing rate paid for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2000 was 49 basis points higher, increasing from 6.85% to 7.34%, due to the impact of higher interest rates on our new borrowings. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $400.1 million as compared with prior year period primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $1.3 million, or 8%, as compared with prior year period primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss) and the write off of regulatory assets related to our sale of our Louisiana gas operations. The estimated annual effective tax rate for 2002 is 33.7% as compared with an effective tax rate of 20.4% for 2001.

On January 15, 2002, we completed the sale of our water and wastewater operations to American Water Works, Inc. for $859.1 million in cash and $122.5 million of assumed debt and other liabilities. The gain on the disposal of the water segment, net of tax was $181.4 million.

Deregulation of most of our local exchange telephone properties required us to cease application of SFAS 71 in the third quarter, resulting in a non cash extraordinary charge of $43.6 million, net of tax, in our statement of operations. See discussion in Note 24 of Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity and commodity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business or to hedge long term interest rate risk. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity and commodity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio and interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. The long term debt and capital lease obligations include various instruments with various maturities and weighted average interest rates. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, a majority of our borrowings have fixed interest rates; variable rate debt is refinanced when advantageous. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2002, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In order to manage our interest rate risk exposure, we entered into five interest swap agreements in 2001 and 2002 with investment grade financial institutions. Each agreement covered a notional amount of $50.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements, we make semi annual, floating interest rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. There are two interest rate swap agreements that were executed in 2001 that receive a 6.375% fixed rate until the swaps termination date of August 15, 2004, and there are three swaps executed in 2002 that receive an 8.500% fixed rate until their termination date of May 15, 2006. The underlying variable rate on the swaps is set either in advance, in arrears or, as in the case of one agreement, based on each periods daily average six month LIBOR. In connection with these swaps, the Company entered into a series of supplemental rate agreements which had the effect of setting the floating rate portion of the swaps in advance of the contractually agreed upon rate determination date. The net effect of the two 2001 interest rate swaps and supplemental rate agreements was to reduce the effective interest rate on $100.0 million of fixed rate debt from 6.375% to 3.665% during 2002. The net effect of the three 2002 swaps and supplemental rate agreements was to reduce the effective interest rate on $150.0 million of fixed rate debt from 8.500% to 6.864% through November 15, 2002, the latest rate reset date. All swaps and associated supplemental rate agreements are accounted for under SFAS 133 as fair value hedges. 30 Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2002, the fair value of our long term debt and capital lease obligations excluding our equity units was estimated to be approximately $5.4 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 8.0% and our overall weighted maturity of 13 years. There has been no material change in the weighted average maturity since December 31, 2001. The overall weighted average interest rate has increased by approximately 37 basis points. A hypothetical increase of 80 basis points in our weighted average interest rate (10% of our overall weighted average borrowing rate) would result in an approximate $272.3 million decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in equity prices is minimal and relates primarily to the equity portion of our investment portfolio. The equity portion of our investment portfolio consists of equity securities (principally common stock) of D&E Communications, Inc. and Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp. As of December 31, 2002, we owned 3,059,000 shares of Adelphia common stock. As a result of Adelphias price declines and filing for bankruptcy, we recognized losses of $95.3 million and $79.0 million on our investment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as the declines were determined to be other than temporary. As of June 30, 2002, we had written this investment down to zero, and therefore we have no additional exposure related to the market value of Adelphia stock. As of December 31, 2002, we owned 1,333,500 shares of D & E Communications common stock. As the result of an other than temporary decline in D & Es stock price, we recognized a loss of $16.4 million on our investment for the year ended December 31, 2002. Sensitivity analysis of equity price exposure At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio was estimated to be $29.8 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted market prices would result in an approximate $3.0 million decrease in the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio. Commodity Price Exposure We purchase monthly gas future contracts, from time to time, to manage well defined commodity price fluctuations, caused by weather and other unpredictable factors, associated with our commitments to deliver natural gas to customers at fixed prices. Customers pay for gas service based upon prices that are defined by a tariff. A tariff is an agreement between the public utility commission and us, which determines the price that will be charged to the customer. Fluctuations in gas prices are routinely handled through a pricing mechanism called the purchase gas adjustor (PGA). The PGA allows for a process whereby any price change from the agreed upon tariff will be settled as a pass through to the customer. As a result, if gas prices increase, the PGA will increase and pass more costs on to the customer. If gas prices decrease, the PGA will decrease and refunds will be provided to the customer. This commodity activity relates to our gas businesses and is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In all instances we take physical delivery of the gas supply purchased or contracted for. These gas future contracts and gas supply contracts are considered derivative instruments as defined by SFAS 133. However, such contracts are excluded from the provisions of SFAS 133 since they are purchases made in the normal course of business and not for speculative purposes. Based upon our overall commodity price exposure at December 31, 2002, a material near term change in the quoted market price of gas would not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Disclosure of limitations of sensitivity analysis Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value. This analysis incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2002. It does not consider those exposures or positions, which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate exposure with respect to our market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and the fluctuation of interest rates and quoted market prices. 31
