Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, words such as "believes", "anticipates", "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, any of the following possibilities: * Changes in the number of our access lines; * The effects of competition from wireless, other wireline carriers (through Unbundled Network Elements (UNE), Unbundled Network Elements Platform (UNEP), voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise), high speed cable modems and cable telephony; * The effects of general and local economic and employment conditions on our revenues; * Our ability to effectively manage and otherwise monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers, and our ability to sell enhanced and data services; * The effects of changes in regulation in the telecommunications industry as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state legislation and regulation, including changes in access charges and subsidy payments; * Our ability to manage our operating expenses, capital expenditures and reduce our debt; * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * The effects of bankruptcies in the telecommunications industry which could result in higher network access costs and potential bad debts; * The effects of technological changes, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to adequately serve our customers or to match the capabilities and pricing of competing networks; * The effects of increased medical expenses and related funding requirements; * The effect of changes in the telecommunications market, including the likelihood of significantly increased price and service competition; * Our ability to successfully convert the billing system for approximately 775,000 of our access lines on a timely basis and within our expected amount for 2004 of $20.0 $25.0 million (a significant portion of which is expected to be capitalized and amortized) and, beginning in 2005, to achieve our expected cost savings from the conversion; * The effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; * Our ability to successfully renegotiate expiring union contracts covering approximately 1,100 employees that are scheduled to expire during 2004; 15 * Possible changes to our capital structure (including the amount of our debt), liquidity and strategy that could result from our ongoing review of strategic and financial alternatives; and * The effects of more general factors, including changes in economic conditions; changes in the capital markets; changes in industry conditions; changes in our credit ratings; and changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators. You should consider these important factors in evaluating any statement in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. Overview We are a telecommunications company providing wireline communications services to rural areas and small and medium sized towns and cities as an incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC. We offer our ILEC services under the "Frontier" name. In addition, we provide competitive local exchange carrier, or CLEC, services to business customers and to other communications carriers in certain metropolitan areas in the western United States through Electric Lightwave, LLC, or ELI, our wholly owned subsidiary. We also provide electric distribution services to primarily rural customers in Vermont. Competition in the telecommunications industry is increasing. Although we have not faced as much competition as larger, more urban telecommunications companies, we do experience competition from other wireline local carriers through Unbundled Network Elements (UNE), VOIP and potentially in the future through Unbundled Network Elements Platform (UNEP), from other long distance carriers (including Regional Bell Operating Companies), from cable companies and internet service providers with respect to internet access and cable telephony, and from wireless carriers. Most of the wireline competition we face is in our Rochester, New York market, with competition also present in a few other areas. Time Warner Cable is expected to begin selling VOIP service in our Rochester market during 2004. Competition from cable companies and other internet service providers with respect to internet access is intense. Competition from wireless companies and other long distance companies is increasing in all of our markets. The telecommunications industry is undergoing significant changes and difficulties. The market for internet access, long distance, long haul and related services in the United States is extremely competitive, with substantial overcapacity in the market. Demand and pricing for certain CLEC services (such as long haul services) have decreased substantially. There is also increasing price pressure on certain of our ILEC services such as long distance and internet access. These trends are likely to continue and result in a challenging revenue environment. These factors could also result in more bankruptcies in the sector and therefore affect our ability to collect money owed to us by carriers. Several long distance and Interexchange Carriers (IXCs) have filed for bankruptcy protection, which will allow them to substantially reduce their cost structure and debt. This could enable such companies to further reduce prices and increase competition. Our ILEC business has been experiencing declining access lines, switched minutes of use and revenues because of economic conditions, high unemployment levels, increasing competition (as described above), changing consumer behavior (such as wireless displacement of wireline use and email use) and regulatory constraints. During 2003, our access lines declined 1.9%, our switched minutes of use declined 1.8% and our ILEC revenues declined 0.7%, in each case as compared to 2002. These factors are likely to cause our local network service, switched network access, long distance and subsidy revenues to continue to decline during 2004. During 2003, our switched network access revenue declined 6.0%, our long distance revenue declined 4.7% and our subsidy revenue declined 4.5%, in each case as compared to 2002. One of the ways we are responding to competition is by bundling services and products and offering them for a single price, which results in lower pricing than purchasing the services separately. During 2003, we added approximately 76,200 customers who are buying one of our bundled packages and increased our revenue from enhanced services by 7.8%. In addition, we added approximately 49,800 DSL subscribers during 2003 and increased our data revenue by 19.8%. Our average revenue per month per average number of customers during 2003 was $70.51 compared to $69.83 during 2002. The above discussion excludes the sale of approximately 11,000 and 4,000 access lines in North Dakota on April 1, 2003 and October 31, 2002, respectively. Revenues from data services such as DSL continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from high margin services such as local line and access charges and subsidies are decreasing as a percentage of our revenues. These factors, along with increasing operating and employee costs may cause our profitability to decrease. In addition, costs we will incur during 2004 to convert the billing system for some of our access lines, to enable our systems to be capable of LNP and to retain certain employees will affect our profitability and capital expenditures during 2004. 16 (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2003, we used cash flows from continuing operations, the proceeds from the sale of utility properties, cash and cash equivalents to fund capital expenditures, interest payments and debt repayments. On August 8, 2003, we completed the sale of The Gas Company in Hawaii division for $119.3 million in cash and assumed liabilities, on August 11, 2003 we completed the sale of our Arizona gas and electric divisions for $224.1 million in cash, and on December 1, 2003 we completed the sale of our electric transmission facility in Vermont for $7.3 million in cash. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $583.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, our capital expenditures were $278.0 million, including $244.0 million for the ILEC segment, $9.5 million for the ELI segment, $23.9 million for the public utilities services segments ($22.1 million of which related to businesses that have been sold) and $0.6 million of general capital expenditures. Our capital spending has been trending lower as we continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. For example, in 2004 we will allocate significant capital to services such as DSL in areas that are growing or demonstrate meaningful demand for DSL, and for cost reduction opportunities such as our billing system conversion. In the past, large capital outlays were made in newly acquired properties to be able to offer all of our services across all of our areas and in order to improve network capability and service quality. After those investments were made, the total amount of capital spending has been further reduced because of declining revenues and lower costs from vendors. We will continue to focus on managing our costs while increasing our investment in certain new product areas such as DSL, VPN and VOIP. We have budgeted approximately $276.0 million for our 2004 capital projects including $265.0 million for the ILEC segment (approximately $12.0 million of which relates to our billing system conversion) and $11.0 million for the ELI segment. Included in these budgeted capital amounts are approximately $9.0 million of capital expenditures associated with LNP. If the number of requests for LNP exceeds our expectations, this amount could increase. Costs to implement LNP will, however, be mitigated by charges to end users for enabling our systems to be capable of LNP. Furthermore, the Company has received extensions of time to make our entire network CALEA compliant. However, failure to be granted further extensions could increase capital expenditures by up to $7.0 million in 2004. We have an available shelf registration of $825.6 million and we have available lines of credit with financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $805.0 million. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our credit ratings, and are 0.25% per annum as of December 31, 2003. The expiration date for the facilities is October 24, 2006. During the term of the facilities we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds. As of December 31, 2003, there were no outstanding advances under these facilities. We believe operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and current credit facilities will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, make required debt repayments through 2005 and support our short term and long term operating strategies. Our credit facilities expire, and we have approximately $1,335.0 million of debt that matures, in 2006 (assuming the $460 million of debt that is part of our Equity Units remains outstanding until then). We are likely to need to refinance a significant amount of this debt prior to maturity and to extend the term of our credit facilities prior to expiration. In addition, our ongoing review of financial and strategic alternatives could result in an increase in the amount of our debt and as a result our debt service requirements. Debt Reduction For the year ended December 31, 2003, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $726.6 million of debt. On February 1, 2003, we repaid at maturity $35.0 million of Frontier Communications of Minnesota 7.61% Senior Notes. In March 2003, we terminated a capital lease obligation at ELI, which resulted in a non cash pre tax gain of $40.7 million included in investment and other income (loss), net. In addition, in June 2003, ELI reduced its obligations under another capital lease by reducing the number of optical fibers leased, which resulted in a non cash pre tax gain of $25.0 million included in investment and other income (loss), net. 17 During June 2003, we redeemed five separate issues of the Companys Industrial Development Revenue Bonds aggregating $75.5 million, and seven issues of the Companys Special Purpose Revenue Bonds aggregating $88.8 million. All of these redemptions were funded with cash. During July and August 2003, we redeemed for cash two additional Industrial Development Revenue Bond series aggregating $13.5 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, we executed a series of purchases in the open market of our outstanding debt securities. The aggregate principal amount of debt securities purchased was $94.9 million at a premium of approximately $3.1 million. During the period between June 15, 2003 and July 15, 2003, holders of the Companys outstanding $15.1 million principal amount of 6.80% Debentures due August 15, 2026 had the option to put the Debentures to the Company for mandatory redemption at par on August 15, 2003. As a result, the entire outstanding principal amount of these debentures had been classified as debt due within one year on the Companys balance sheet since the third quarter of 2002. By July 15, 2003 holders of just $2.5 million of the debentures had exercised their right to put the debentures to us on August 15, 2003. We subsequently repurchased $1.0 million of these debentures in the open market. Accordingly, the $11.6 million of remaining have been reclassified as long term debt on the balance sheet, with a final maturity of August 15, 2026. In connection with the sale of our gas property in Hawaii during August 2003, the buyer assumed, and the State of Hawaii released us from, all of our obligations in connection with approximately $17.6 million of outstanding Hawaii special purpose revenue bonds. In connection with the sale of our Arizona utility businesses in August 2003, we called for redemption approximately $31.2 million of the Companys Arizona industrial development revenue bonds. These bonds were redeemed with cash during November 2003. In addition, we agreed to call at their first call dates in 2007 another three Arizona industrial development revenue bond series totaling approximately $33.4 million. On August 13, 2003, we called for redemption the entire $232.6 million outstanding of our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2004. These notes were redeemed with cash on September 17, 2003 at a premium of approximately $10.3 million. In connection with this redemption, we terminated two interest rate swaps involving an aggregate $100.0 million notional amount of indebtedness. The proceeds from the settlement of the swaps of approximately $3.0 million were applied against the cost to retire the debt, resulting in a net premium of $7.3 million. On October 1, 2003, ELI settled all of its outstanding liabilities under a capital lease with a cash payment of $44.5 million, representing a discount from the carrying value of the capital lease obligation of approximately $2.1 million. On November 15, 2003, we redeemed with cash at par approximately $8.9 million of the Companys Illinois environmental facilities revenue bonds. On December 1, 2003, ELI settled all of its outstanding liabilities under a capital lease with a cash payment of $19.0 million, representing a premium from the carrying value of the capital lease obligation of approximately $1.3 million. Interest Rate Management In order to manage our interest expense, we have entered into interest swap agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, we make semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. The underlying variable rate on these swaps is set either in advance, in arrears or based on each periods daily average six month LIBOR. The notional amounts of fixed rate indebtedness hedged as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 were $400.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively. Such contracts require us to pay variable rates of interest (average pay rate of approximately 5.46% as of December 31, 2003) and receive fixed rates of interest (average receive rate of 8.38% as of December 31, 2003). All swaps are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 as fair value hedges. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the interest savings resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $8.9 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationship with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. 18 Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003 is as follows: Contractual Obligations: Less than More than ($ in thousands) Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt obligations (See Note 12) (1) $4,733,570 $ 87,851 $1,342,224 $ 755,269 $2,548,226 Capital lease obligations (See Note 27) 10,061 151 329 419 9,162 Operating lease obligations (See Note 27) 107,128 23,601 28,809 19,905 34,813 Purchase obligations (See Note 27) 86,631 57,881 28,750 Other long term liabilities (See Note16) (2) 201,250 201,250 Total $5,138,640 $ 169,484 $1,400,112 $ 775,593 $2,793,451 (1) Includes the debt portion of the equity units ($460.0 million) and interest rate swaps ($10.6 million). (2) Consists of our Equity Providing Preferred Income Convertible Securities (EPPICS) reflected on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2003, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $19.5 million. Our Board of Directors has approved retention and "change of control" arrangements to incent certain executives and employees to continue their employment with Citizens while we explore and consider our financial and strategic alternatives. These arrangements include a mix of cash retention payments, equity awards and enhanced severance and are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events and tenure. If (i) the covered employees remain with the Company for specified time periods, (ii) a change of control (as defined) occurs and (iii) all employees covered by the arrangements are terminated, additional compensation currently estimated to be approximately $54.0 million in the aggregate is payable to the employees. If (i) the covered employees remain for the specified time periods and (ii) a "change of control" occurs but none of the employees are terminated, the amount payable to the employees would be reduced to approximately $45.0 million. If no "change of control" occurs, but the covered employees remain with the Company for the specified periods, we expect to recognize (assuming all the employees remain for the specified periods), approximately $9.8 million of additional compensation expense in 2004, $3.4 million in 2005 and $3.0 million in 2006, pursuant to the arrangements. In addition to the arrangements and amounts described in the preceding paragraph, restrictions on stock that has been previously awarded to employees as part of their regular compensation would lapse in the event of a change of control. We expense such grants over their vesting life (typically three to four years). We will expense approximately $8.5 million of such restricted stock awards in 2004, which is consistent with our prior years expense. The unamortized cost with respect to such restricted stock at the end of 2004 that would be accelerated and immediately expensed upon a change in control is currently estimated to be approximately $23.0 million. EPPICS In 1996, our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust (the Trust), issued, in an underwritten public offering, 4,025,000 shares of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 (Trust Convertible Preferred Securities or EPPICS), representing preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust, with a liquidation preference of $50 per security (for a total liquidation amount of $201.3 million). The proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase $207.5 million aggregate liquidation amount of 5% Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 from another wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Capital L.P. (the Partnership). The proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase from us $211.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2036. The sole assets of the Trust are the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and our Convertible Subordinated Debentures are substantially all the assets of the Partnership. Our obligations under the agreements related to the issuances of such securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trusts obligations relating to the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and the Partnerships obligations relating to the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities. 19 In accordance with the terms of the issuances, we paid the 5% interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Only cash was paid to the Partnership in payment of the interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The cash was then distributed by the Partnership to the Trust and then by the Trust to the holders of the EPPICS. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facility agreements are of a general nature, and do not currently impose significant financial performance criteria on us. These general covenants include the timely and punctual payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no material restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us, or by us to our shareholders, either by contract, rule or regulation. Our $805.0 million credit facilities and our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC) contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters of no greater than 4.50 to 1 through December 30, 2003, 4.25 to 1 from then until December 30, 2004, and 4.00 to 1 thereafter. We are in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Acquisitions On June 29, 2001, we purchased Frontier for approximately $3,373.0 million in cash. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture for our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. We have sold all of these properties except for one electric distribution and generation business in Vermont (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements). All of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities (typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale), including environmental liabilities, for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement. On January 15, 2002, we sold our water and wastewater services operations for $859.1 million in cash and $122.5 million in assumed debt and other liabilities. On October 31, 2002, we completed the sale of approximately 4,000 access lines in North Dakota for approximately $9.7 million in cash. On November 1, 2002, we completed the sale of our Kauai electric division for $215.0 million in cash. On April 1, 2003, we completed the sale of approximately 11,000 access lines in North Dakota for approximately $25.7 million in cash. On April 4, 2003, we completed the sale of our wireless partnership interest in Wisconsin for approximately $7.5 million in cash. On August 8, 2003, we completed the sale of The Gas Company in Hawaii division for $119.3 million in cash and assumed liabilities. On August 11, 2003, we completed the sale of our Arizona gas and electric divisions for $224.1 million in cash. On December 2, 2003, we completed the sale of our electric transmission facilities in Vermont for $7.3 million in cash. All of the remaining assets of our Vermont electric division and their related liabilities are classified as "assets held for sale" and "liabilities related to assets held for sale," respectively. These assets have been written down to our best estimate of the net realizable value upon sale. 20 Discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations and the gain on sale of the water/wastewater properties sold in January 2002 including allocated interest expense for the periods presented. Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations based on the outstanding debt specifically identified with this business. Discontinuation of SFAS No. 71 Prior to 2001, our incumbent local exchange telephone properties had been predominantly regulated following a cost of service/rate of return approach. Accordingly, we applied the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In the third quarter of 2001, we concluded that the provisions of SFAS No. 71 were no longer applicable to our local exchange telephone properties. Our conclusion was based on the fact that pricing for a majority of our revenues in our incumbent local exchange telephone properties is based upon price cap plans that limit prices to changes in general inflation and estimates of productivity for the industry at large or upon market pricing rather than on the specific costs of operating our business, a requirement for the application of SFAS No.71. We expect these trends in the deregulation of pricing and the introduction of competition to continue. We intend to operate all of our properties as competitive enterprises, to meet competitive entry and maximize revenue by providing a broad range of products and services, such as data services. Many of these future services will not be regulated, further increasing the percentage of our revenue provided by our networks that is not based upon historical cost/rate of return regulation. As discussed further in Note 24 to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2001 we recorded a non cash extraordinary charge of $43.6 million net of tax in our statement of operations, to write off regulatory assets and liabilities that were recorded on our balance sheet. Based upon our evaluation of the pace of technological change that is estimated to occur in certain components of our rural telephone networks, we concluded that minor modifications in our asset lives were required for the major network technology assets. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 101 and SFAS No. 121, we performed a test of the impairment of the property, plant and equipment accounts for our properties discontinuing SFAS No. 71 and based upon our expectations of future changes in sales volumes and prices and the anticipated rate of entry of additional competition into our markets, we concluded that an asset impairment was not warranted. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, employee benefit plans, income taxes and contingencies, among others. Telecommunications Bankruptcies Our estimate of anticipated losses related to telecommunications bankruptcies is a "critical accounting estimate." We have significant on going normal course business relationships with many telecom providers, some of which have filed for bankruptcy. We generally reserve approximately 95% of the net outstanding pre bankruptcy balances owed to us and believe that our estimate of the net realizable value of the amounts owed to us by bankrupt entities is appropriate. Asset Impairment We believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a "critical accounting estimate." With respect to ELI, the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions about future revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures over the life of the property, plant and equipment (generally 5 to 15 years) as well as the probability of occurrence of the various scenarios and appropriate discount rates. Managements assumptions about ELIs future revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as the probability of occurrence of these various scenarios require significant judgment because the CLEC industry is changing and because actual revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to do so in the future. 21 Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results. Our depreciation expense has decreased substantially from prior periods as a result of the impairment write down we recorded during 2002, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the increase in the average depreciable lives for certain of our equipment. With respect to our remaining electric property, our estimate of net realizable value is based upon the expected future sales price of this property and the associated discharge of obligations. Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, our reporting unit is the ILEC segment. In determining fair value of goodwill during 2003 we utilized two tests. One test utilized recent trading prices for completed ILEC acquisitions of similarly situated properties. A second test utilized current trading values for the Companys publicly traded common stock. We reviewed the results of both tests for consistency to ensure that our conclusions were appropriate. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our tests determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill. An independent third party appraiser analyzed trade name. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other post retirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are "critical accounting estimates." We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our employees and other post retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance benefits and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The accounting results for pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. The Company reviews these assumptions for changes annually with its outside actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. The discount rate is used to value, on a present basis, our pension and post retirement benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and post retirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the interest rates for long term high quality corporate bonds. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and post retirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year and 10 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 30% to 45% in fixed income securities and 55% to 70% in equity securities. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. We continue to evaluate our own actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually. Our pension plan assets are valued at actual market value as of the measurement date. Accounting standards require that we record an additional minimum pension liability when the plans "accumulated benefit obligation" exceeds the fair market value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement (balance sheet) date. In the fourth quarter of 2002, due to weak performance in the equity markets during 2002 as well as a decrease in the year end discount rate, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability in the amount of $181.0 million with a corresponding charge to shareholders equity of $112.0 million, net of taxes of $69.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2003, due to strong performance in the equity markets during 2003, partially offset by a decrease in the year end discount rate, the Company recorded a reduction to its minimum pension liability in the amount of $35.0 million with a corresponding credit to shareholders equity of $22.0 million, net of taxes of $13.0 million. These adjustments did not impact our earnings or cash flows. If discount rates and the equity markets performance decline, the Company could be required to increase its minimum pension liabilities and record additional charges to shareholders equity in the future. 22 Actual results that differ from our assumptions are added or subtracted to our balance of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. For example, if the year end discount rate used to value the plans projected benefit obligation decreases from the prior year end then the plans actuarial loss will increase. If the discount rate increases from the prior year end then the plans actuarial loss will decrease. Similarly, the difference generated from the plans actual asset performance as compared to expected performance would be included in the balance of unrecognized gains and losses. The impact of the balance of accumulated actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the computation of pension cost only to the extent this balance exceeds 10% of the greater of the plans projected benefit obligation or market value of plan assets. If this occurs, that portion of gain or loss that is in excess of 10% is amortized over the estimated future service period of plan participants as a component of pension cost. The level of amortization is affected each year by the change in actuarial gains and losses and could potentially be eliminated if the gain/loss activity reduces the net accumulated gain/loss balance to a level below the 10% threshold. We expect that our pension expense for 2004 will be $2 million $4 million (it was $12.4 million in 2003) and no contribution will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2004. No contribution was made, or required, in 2003. Income Taxes We expect to reach conclusion on various state and federal income tax audits in 2004. Our 2004 effective income tax rate may vary from that of prior periods as a result. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. New Accounting Pronouncements Goodwill and Other Intangibles In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment. We have no intangibles with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill and trade name. The amortization of goodwill and trade name ceased upon adoption of the statement on January 1, 2002. We were required to test for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives as of January 1, 2002 and at least annually thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss at January 1, 2002 was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, we recognized a transitional impairment loss related to ELI of $39.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in 2002. We annually examine the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangibles with estimated useful lives to determine whether there are any impairment losses and have determined for the year ended December 31, 2003 that there was no impairment. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over those lives and be reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." We reassess the useful life of our intangible assets with estimated useful lives annually. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 is discussed in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 applies to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, and addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the assets and requires that a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized when incurred, recorded at fair value and classified as a liability in the balance sheet. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity will capitalize the cost and increase the carrying value of the related long lived asset. The liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. At the settlement date, the entity will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss upon settlement. 23 Depreciation expense for the Companys wireline operations had historically included an additional provision for cost of removal. Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, on January 1, 2003, the Company ceased recognition of the cost of removal provision in depreciation expense and eliminated the cumulative cost of removal included in accumulated depreciation, as the Company has no legal obligation to remove certain long lived assets. The cumulative effect of retroactively applying these changes to periods prior to January 1, 2003, resulted in an after tax non cash gain of approximately $65.8 million recognized in 2003. Long Lived Assets In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for impairment of long lived assets held and used and for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2002. Debt Retirement In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." This statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. The statement requires gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" which provides guidance for distinguishing transactions that are part of an entitys recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. We adopted SFAS No. 145 in the second quarter of 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recognized $64.8 million and $29.3 million of gains from early debt retirement as other income, respectively. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a $12.8 million loss due to a tender offer related to certain debt securities. There were no similar types of retirements in 2001. Exit or Disposal Activities In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than on the date of commitment to an exit plan. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Guarantees In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that a guarantor be required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under the guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with the guarantee. The provisions of FIN 45 are effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted FIN 45 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Stock Based Compensation In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the expanded disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148. 24 Variable Interest Entities In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which was issued in January 2003. We are required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in variable interest entities or VIEs created after December 31, 2003. For variable interests in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, the Interpretation will be applied beginning on January 1, 2005. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE. We are currently evaluating our investments and other arrangements to determine whether any of our investee companies are VIEs. It is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this Statement on our financial statements at the date of this report. Derivative Instruments and Hedging In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging," which clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. This Statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. We adopted SFAS No. 149 on July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." The Statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Generally, the Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We adopted the provisions of the Statement on July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." This statement retains and revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original statement. It requires additional disclosures including information describing the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date(s), plan obligations, cash flows, and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized in interim periods. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. We adopted the expanded disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132 (revised). The FASB also recently indicated that it will require stock based employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings beginning in 2004. We will continue to monitor the progress on the issuance of this standard. (b) Results of Operations REVENUE ILEC revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance and data services. Such services are provided under either a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at a tariffed rate and is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. CLEC revenue is generated through local, long distance, data and long haul services. These services are primarily provided under a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at agreed upon rates and are not dependent upon significant judgments by management with the exception of the determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts and realizability of reciprocal compensation. CLEC usage based revenue includes amounts determined under reciprocal compensation agreements. While this revenue is governed by specific contracts with the counterparty, management defers recognition of portions of such revenue until realizability is assured. Revenue earned from long haul contracts is recognized over the term of the related agreement. 25 Revenue from the provision of public utility services are recognized based on usage without significant judgments made by management with the exception of a provision for uncollectible accounts. Consolidated revenue decreased $224.4 million, or 8% in 2003. The decrease in 2003 was primarily due to $192.7 million of decreased gas and electric revenue primarily due to the disposition of our Arizona gas and electric operations and The Gas Company in Hawaii division and $31.7 million of decreased telecommunications revenue. Consolidated revenue increased $212.3 million, or 9%, in 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to $420.5 million of increased telecommunications revenue, largely due to the impact of the Frontier acquisition on June 29, 2001, partially offset by $195.0 million of decreased gas revenue largely due to the disposition of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations and the disposition of the Kauai electric division. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions in the ILEC sector as well as the pass through to customers of the increased cost of gas offset by the disposition of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations. On October 31, 2002 and April 1, 2003, we sold approximately 4,000 and 11,000 telephone access lines, respectively, in North Dakota. The revenues related to these access lines totaled $1.9 million; $10.2 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Access services $ 667,042 $ (24,852) 4% $ 691,894 $ 111,126 19% $ 580,768 Local services 859,002 8,683 1% 850,319 191,036 29% 659,283 Long distance and data services 306,834 7,508 3% 299,326 102,229 52% 197,097 Directory services 106,934 2,551 2% 104,383 32,008 44% 72,375 Other 101,123 (15,860) 14% 116,983 32,453 38% 84,530 ILEC revenue 2,040,935 (21,970) 1% 2,062,905 468,852 29% 1,594,053 ELI 165,389 (9,690) 6% 175,079 (48,312) 22% 223,391 $2,206,324 $ (31,660) 1% $2,237,984 $420,540 23% $1,817,444 Change in the number of our access lines is the most fundamental driver of changes in our telecommunications revenue. Historically, rural local telephone companies experienced steady growth in access lines because of positive demographic trends, steady rural local economies and little competition. Many rural local telephone companies (including us) have recently experienced a loss of access lines primarily because of difficult economic conditions, increased competition from competitive wireline providers, from wireless providers and from cable companies (currently with respect to broadband but which may in the future expand to cable telephony), and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add DSL or cable modem service. Excluding the North Dakota sale, we lost approximately 47,100 access lines during 2003 but added approximately 49,800 DSL subscribers during this period. The loss of lines during 2003 was equally weighted between residential and non residential customers. The non residential line losses were principally in Rochester, while the residential losses were throughout our markets. We expect to continue to lose access lines during 2004. A continued decrease in access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed in this MD&A, may cause our revenues to decrease in 2004. Access Services Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $24.9 million or 4% as compared with the prior year period. Switched access revenue decreased $20.7 million primarily due to the $18.1 million effect of access rate reductions effective July 1, 2003, $2.6 million in increased disputes and $1.2 million related to the sale of our North Dakota exchanges. Special access revenue increased $4.6 million primarily due to growth in special circuits of $8.4 million partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million attributable to the sale of our North Dakota exchanges and $1.2 million in increased disputes. Access services revenue includes our subsidy revenue, which decreased $8.7 million primarily due to decreased National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) support of $11.8 million partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million in Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharge rates. 26 We expect our subsidy revenue to be approximately $9.0 million lower in 2004 than in 2003 primarily because of increases implemented during 2003 and 2004 in national average loop costs that are compared to our costs (which have been decreasing) to determine the amount of subsidy payments we receive. Our switched access revenues are impacted by the program, known as the Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Services, or CALLS plan, which establishes a price floor for interstate switched access services and phases out many of the subsidies in interstate access rates. We have been able to offset some of the reduction in interstate access rates through end user charges. There are no material increases in end user charges scheduled to take effect during 2004 or 2005. We believe the net effect of reductions in interstate access rates and increases in end user charges will reduce our revenues by approximately $10.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Annual reductions in interstate switched access rates will continue through 2005 until the price floor is reached. Our switched access revenues have also been adversely affected by declining switched access minutes of use, which we expect to continue. Our subsidy and switched access revenues are very profitable so any reductions in those revenues may reduce our profitability. Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $111.1 million, or 19%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $92.4 million. Increases in subsidies of $20.3 million and non switched access revenue of $12.5 million due to higher circuit sales were partially offset by a decrease in switched access revenue of $16.5 million primarily from the effect of tariff rate reductions effective as of July 1, 2002. Local Services Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $8.7 million, or 1% as compared with the prior year period. Local revenue decreased $1.1 million primarily due to a $7.6 million decrease from continued losses of access lines and the $4.0 million impact of the sale of our North Dakota exchanges in 2003, partially offset by an $10.4 million increase in subscriber line charges due to rate changes. Local services revenue includes our enhanced services revenue, which increased $9.8 million primarily due to the sale of additional feature packages. Continued difficult economic conditions or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our packages and bundles and cause us to lower our prices for those products and services, which would adversely affect our revenues. Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $191.0 million, or 29%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $184.8 million. Increases of $8.0 million in enhanced services for feature packages and $12.5 million from SLC were partially offset by an $8.6 million decrease resulting from rate changes and line losses. Long Distance and Data Services Long distance and data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $7.5 million or 3% as compared with the prior year period primarily due to growth of $17.6 million related to data services, partially offset by a decrease of $10.0 million in long distance revenue. Our long distance revenues decreased during 2003 due to lower average rates per minute related to the introduction of new products including unlimited long distance and lower long distance minutes of use because consumers are increasingly using their wireless phones or calling cards to make long distance calls. We expect these factors will continue to affect our long distance revenues during 2004. Long distance and data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $102.2 million, or 52%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $72.4 million, $13.7 million growth related to data and dedicated circuits and growth in long distance services of $11.0 million. Directory Services Directory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.6 million or 2%, as compared with the prior year periods primarily due to growth in yellow pages advertising. Directory services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $32.0 million, or 44%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $30.0 million and growth in yellow pages advertising revenue of $2.0 million. Other Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $15.9 million, or 14% compared with the prior year period primarily due to $7.8 million in increased dispute reserves, the termination in 2002 of $2.5 million in contract services provided to Global Crossing and a decrease of $2.0 million in Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) sales. In addition, revenue from collocation/rents declined $1.1 million and conferencing revenue decreased $1.0 million. 27 Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $32.5 million, or 38%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $32.8 million. ELI revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 decreased $9.7 million, or 6%, and $48.3 million, or 22%, respectively, primarily due to lower demand and prices for long haul services, a decline in Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) services due to less demand from internet service providers and lower reciprocal compensation revenues. GAS AND ELECTRIC REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Gas revenue $ 137,686 $ (78,831) 36% $ 216,517 $ (195,017) 47% $ 411,534 Electric revenue $ 100,928 $ (113,903) 53% $ 214,831 $ (13,184) 6% $ 228,015 Gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $78.8 million, or 36%, as compared with the prior year period due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Arizona gas division, which were sold on August 8, 2003 and August 11, 2003, respectively. We have sold all of our gas operations and as a result will have no operating results in future periods for these businesses. Gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $195.0 million, or 47%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations partially offset by higher purchased gas costs passed on to consumers. Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $113.9 million, or 53%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sales of our Arizona electric division and Kauai Electric. Included in electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 is approximately $183.5 million of revenue from our Arizona electric division and Kauai Electric, which were sold on August 11, 2003 and November 1, 2002, respectively. We have just one remaining electric utility property as of December 31, 2003. We expect to sell this property by mid 2004. Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $13.2 million, or 6%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale of our Kauai electric division partially offset by increased unit sales and the effect of a rate increase approved in Vermont on July 15, 2002. COST OF SERVICES ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Network access $ 223,547 $ (11,915) 5% $ 235,462 $ 41,368 21% $ 194,094 Gas purchased 82,311 (40,604) 33% 122,915 (159,146) 56% 282,061 Electric energy and fuel oil purchased 63,831 (54,712) 46% 118,543 (4,680) 4% 123,223 $ 369,689 $(107,231) 22% $ 476,920 $(122,458) 20% $ 599,378 Network access expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $11.9 million, or 5%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to decreased costs in long distance access expense related to rate changes partially offset by increased circuit expense associated with additional data product sales in the ILEC sector. ELI costs have declined due to a drop in demand coupled with improved network cost efficiencies. If we continue to increase our sales of data products such as DSL or expand the availability of our unlimited calling plans, our network access expense could increase. Network access expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $41.4 million, or 21%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $41.3 million and increased costs of $16.6 million in the ILEC sector, partially offset by decreased costs of $16.5 million in ELI as a result of decreases in demand and a reduction in the number of cities in which ELI operates. 28 Gas purchased for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $40.6 million, or 33%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Arizona gas division. We no longer have any gas operations. Gas purchased for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $159.1 million, or 56%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations partially offset by an increase in the cost of gas due to higher commodity pricing. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $54.7 million, or 46%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sales of our Arizona electric division and Kauai Electric. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $4.7 million, or 4%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the sale on November 1, 2002 of Kauai electric partially offset by increased purchased power costs. Included in electric energy and fuel oil purchased for 2002 and 2001 is approximately $27.5 million and $37.9 million, respectively, of electricity purchased by our Kauai electric operation that ceased upon its sale on November 1, 2002. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Operating expenses $ 692,249 $ (70,624) 9% $ 762,873 $ 23,751 3% $ 739,122 Taxes other than income taxes 97,119 (34,139) 26% 131,258 15,448 13% 115,810 Sales and marketing 112,383 4,159 4% 108,224 11,446 12% 96,778 $ 901,751 $(100,604) 10% $1,002,355 $ 50,645 5% $ 951,710 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $70.6 million, or 9%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to increased operating efficiencies and a reduction of personnel in the ILEC and ELI sectors (310 fewer employees than 2002) and decreased operating expenses in the gas and electric sectors due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii ($11.3 million), our Arizona gas and electric divisions ($16.4 million) and Kauai Electric ($21.5 million). Expenses were negatively impacted by increased compensation expense of $1.5 million related to variable stock plans and increased pension expenses as discussed below. We routinely review our operations, personnel and facilities to achieve greater efficiencies. These reviews may result in reductions in personnel and an increase in severance costs. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $23.8 million, or 3%, as compared with prior year period primarily due to increased operating expenses related to the full year impact of Frontier of $149.9 million partially offset by increased operating efficiencies and a reduction of personnel in the ILEC and ELI sectors, and decreased operating expenses in the gas sector due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. The increase was also offset by the fact that there were no acquisition assimilation costs in 2002 compared to $21.4 million of such costs in 2001. Included in operating expenses is pension expense. In future periods, if the value of our pension assets decline and or projected benefit costs increase, we may have increased pension expenses. Based on our assumptions for 2004 (return on plan assets of 8.25% per year and a discount rate of 6.25%) and plan asset values, we estimate that our pension expense, which increased from $4.3 million in 2002 to $12.4 million in 2003, will decrease to approximately $2 $4 million in 2004 and that no contribution will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2004. No contribution was made, or required, in 2003. In addition, as medical costs increase the costs of our post retirement benefit costs also increase. Our postretirement benefit costs for 2003 were $16.9 million and our current estimate for 2004 is approximately $19 $20 million. Increases in medical costs also increase expenses for providing health care benefits to our existing employees. We expect our total benefit costs for existing employees to increase in 2004. In future periods, compensation expense related to variable stock plans may be materially affected by our stock price. A $1.00 change in our stock price impacts compensation expense by approximately $1.0 million. Taxes other than income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $34.1 million, or 26%, as compared with the prior year periods primarily due to decreased property taxes at ELI due to lower asset values and the sales of the Gas Company in Hawaii, our Arizona gas and electric divisions and Kauai Electric. 29 Taxes other than income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $15.4 million, or 13%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $25.6 million partially offset by decreased payroll taxes in the ILEC sector related to workforce reductions and decreased taxes in the gas sector due to the sale of our Louisiana and Colorado gas operations on July 2, 2001 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $4.2 million, or 4%, as compared to the prior year period due to increased marketing costs in the ILEC sector primarily related to enhanced services and DSL. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $11.4 million, or 12%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $22.2 million, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing in the ELI sector of $10.0 million, primarily due to a reduction in personnel and related costs. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Depreciation expense $ 468,438 $ (161,675) 26% $ 630,113 $ 141,156 29% $ 488,957 Amortization expense 126,838 1,429 1% 125,409 (17,970) 13% 143,379 $ 595,276 $ (160,246) 21% $ 755,522 $ 123,186 19% $ 632,336 Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $161.7 million, or 26%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the ELI impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2002, which reduced ELIs asset base, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the increase in the average depreciable lives for certain of our equipment. Accelerated depreciation in 2002 of $23.4 million relating to the closing of our Plano, Texas facility also contributed to the decrease. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $141.2 million, or 29%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the full year impact of Frontier of $82.6 million and increased depreciation of $35.6 million at ELI. The increase at ELI was primarily due to the purchase of $110.0 million of previously leased facilities in April 2002 and changes in our estimates of the depreciable lives as of June 2002. The Company assessed the estimated life of those facilities as well as the useful lives of similar depreciable assets already held by ELI. The reassessment of the useful lives of ELIs long lived assets was performed to ensure that those lives reflected the expected life of the assets given the nature of ELIs industry and included a comparison to others in the CLEC industry. These increases were offset by a decrease related to the ELI impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2002. As a result of ELIs continued losses and continued revenue declines in excess of previously projected results, ELIs assets including those subject to the change in estimated lives in June 2002, were the subject of the impairment charge reflected as of September 30, 2002. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $1.4 million, or 1% as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the receipt of the final valuation report of our Frontier acquisition during the second quarter of 2002, which resulted in an increase in our customer base. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $18.0 million, or 13%, as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the fact that we ceased amortization of goodwill and trade name related to our previous acquisitions as of January 1, 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This decrease was offset by full year amortization of Frontier acquired customer base. As a result of ELIs adoption of SFAS No. 142, we recognized a transitional impairment loss of $39.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in the first quarter of 2002. RESERVE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS BANKRUPTCIES / RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Reserve for (recovery of) telecommunications bankruptcies $ (4,377) $ (15,257) 140% $ 10,880 $ (10,320) 49% $ 21,200 Restructuring and other expenses $ 9,687 $ (27,499) 74% $ 37,186 $ 17,859 92% $ 19,327 30 During the fourth quarter of 2003, an agreement with WorldCom/MCI settling all pre bankruptcy petition obligations and receivables was approved by the bankruptcy court. This settlement resulted in reduction to our reserve of approximately $6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. During the second quarter 2003, we reserved approximately $2.3 million of trade receivables with Touch America as a result of Touch Americas filing for bankruptcy. These receivables were generated as a result of providing ordinary course telecommunication services. If other telecommunications companies file for bankruptcy we may have additional significant reserves in future periods. Concurrent with the acquisition of Frontier, we entered into several operating agreements with Global Crossing. We have ongoing commercial relationships with Global Crossing affiliates. We reserved a total of $29.0 million of Global Crossing receivables during 2001 and 2002 as a result of Global Crossings filing for bankruptcy to reflect our best estimate of the net realizable value of receivables incurred from these commercial relationships. We recorded a write down of such receivables in the amount of $7.8 million in the first quarter 2002 and $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. In the second quarter 2002, as the result of a settlement agreement with Global Crossing, we reversed $11.6 million of our previous write down of the net realizable value of these receivables. Restructuring and other expenses for 2003 primarily consist of severance expenses related to reductions in personnel at our telecommunications operations and the write off of software no longer used. Restructuring and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily consist of $33.0 million of severance related to reductions in personnel at our telecommunications operations, costs that were spent at both our Plano, Texas facility and at other locations as a result of transitioning functions and jobs, and $6.8 million related to our tender offer in June 2002 for all of the ELI common shares that we did not already own. These costs were partially offset by a $2.8 million reversal of a 2001 ELI accrual discussed below. Plano Restructuring Pursuant to a plan adopted in the third quarter of 2001, we closed our operations support center in Plano, Texas in August 2002. In connection with this plan, we recorded a pre tax charge of $14.6 million in the second half of 2001, $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2002 and we adjusted our accrual down by $0.1 million and $0.6 million in the second and third quarter of 2002, respectively. Our objective is to concentrate our resources in areas where we have the most customers, to better serve those customers. We sold our Plano office building in 2003. The restructuring resulted in the termination of 750 employees. We communicated with all affected employees during July 2001. Certain employees were relocated whereas others were offered severance, job training and or outplacement counseling. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $14.7 million had been paid and all affected employees had been terminated. The restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance benefits, retention payments earned through December 31, 2002, and other planning and communication costs. Sacramento Call Center Restructuring In April 2002, we closed our Sacramento Customer Care Center. In connection with this closing, we recorded a pre tax charge of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, and $0.1 million and $9,000 in the first and second quarters of 2002, respectively. We redirected the call traffic and other work activities to our Kingman, Arizona call center. This restructuring resulted in the elimination of 98 employees. We communicated with all affected employees during November 2001. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $0.8 million was paid, all affected employees were terminated and no accrual remained. ELI Restructuring In the first half of 2002, ELI redeployed the internet routers, frame relay switches and ATM switches from the Atlanta, Cleveland, Denver, Philadelphia and New York markets to other locations in ELIs network. ELI ceased leasing the collocation facilities and off net circuits for the backbone and local loops supporting the service delivery in these markets. It was anticipated that this would lead to $4.2 million of termination fees, which were accrued for but not paid at December 31, 2001. During 2002, ELI adjusted its original accrual down by $2.8 million due to the favorable settlements of termination charges for off net circuit agreements. As of December 31, 2002, $1.4 million has been paid and no accrual remained. 31 LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Loss on impairment $ 15,300 $ (1,058,758) 99% $ 1,074,058 $ 1,074,058 100% $ During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, we recognized additional pre tax impairment losses of $4.0 million and $11.3 million related to our Vermont property to write down assets to be sold to our best estimate of their net realizable value upon sale. In the third quarter 2002, we recognized non cash pre tax impairment losses of $656.7 million related to property, plant and equipment in the ELI sector and $417.4 million related to the gas and electric sector assets held for sale. Our assessment of impairment for ELI was a result of continued losses at ELI and continued actual revenue declines in excess of projected revenue declines. The gas and electric sector impairments were associated with the sale of our Arizona and Hawaiian gas and electric properties at prices that were less than the previous carrying values and the write down of our remaining utility to our best estimate of net realizable sales price. Previously, we believed that the net realizable value of these properties was equal to or above their carrying values. However, as a result of market conditions, and the desire to complete the divestiture process quickly in order to focus on our core telecommunications operations and raise money to further reduce debt, in the third quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to accept proceeds less than carrying values rather than continue to market these properties for higher prices (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above). INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME (LOSS), NET / GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS / INTEREST EXPENSE / INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Investment income (loss), net $ 10,432 $ 108,791 111% $ (98,359) $ (35,951) 58% $ (62,408) Other income (loss), net $ 64,481 $ 51,742 406% $ 12,739 $ 17,557 364% $ (4,818) Gain (loss) on sale of assets $ (20,492) $ (30,290) 309% $ 9,798 $ (129,506) 93% $ 139,304 Interest expense $ 416,524 $ (51,705) 11% $ 468,229 $ 90,588 24% $ 377,641 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 67,216 $ 482,090 116% $(414,874) $ (400,069) 2702% $ (14,805) Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $108.8 million as compared to prior year period primarily due to the recognition in 2002 of non cash pre tax losses of $95.3 million resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in Adelphia and $16.4 million resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in D & E Communications, Inc. (see Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by lower income in 2003 from money market balances and short term investments. Investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $36.0 million, or 58%, as compared to prior year period primarily due to the recognition of a $95.3 million loss, resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in Adelphia Communications Corp. (Adelphia), an increase of $16.3 million compared to the loss of $79.0 million recorded on our Adelphia investment in 2001. We also recognized during 2002 a loss of $16.4 million resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in D & E Communications, Inc. (D & E). Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $51.7 million as compared to prior year period primarily due to $69.4 million in non cash pre tax gains in 2003 related to capital lease restructurings at ELI, $6.2 million of income in 2003 from the settlement of certain retained liabilities at less than face value, which are associated with customer advances for construction from our disposed water properties, a decrease of $20.1 million compared to income of $26.3 million in 2002. During 2003, we executed a series of purchases in the open market of our outstanding notes and debentures that generated a pre tax loss from the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.1 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $17.6 million as compared to prior year period primarily due to $26.3 million of income from the settlement of certain retained liabilities. During 2002, we executed a series of purchases in the open market of our outstanding notes and debentures that generated a pre tax gain from the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.0 million, which also contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by a $12.8 million loss related to a tender offer completed in December 2002 with respect to our 6.80% Debentures due 2026 (puttable at par in 2003) and ELIs 6.05% Guaranteed Notes due 2004. 32 Loss on sale of assets of $20.5 million, net for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $30.3 million as compared with the prior years gain of $9.8 million primarily due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Arizona gas and electric divisions during the third quarter of 2003, the sale of access lines in North Dakota and our wireless partnership interest in Wisconsin during the second quarter of 2003, and the sale of our Plano office building in March 2003. Gain on sale of assets of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $129.5 million as compared with prior years gain of $139.3 million due to the sale of our Kauai electric division on November 1, 2002 as well as an adjustment of the gain on the 2001 sale of our Louisiana gas operation. Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2001 represents the initial gain on the sale of the Louisiana gas operation on July 2, 2001. The gain recognized on our water sale is classified in discontinued operations. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $51.7 million, or 11%, as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the retirement of debt partially offset by higher average interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we had average long term debt (excluding equity units and convertible preferred stock) outstanding of $4.6 billion compared to $5.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002. Our weighted average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with the prior year period was 20 basis points higher, increasing from 7.87% to 8.07%, due to the repayment of debt with interest rates below our average rate. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $90.6 million or 24% as compared with the prior year primarily because of the full year impact of $3.5 billion of notes, $460.0 million of equity units and $200.0 million of Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative notes issued during 2001 to refinance debt incurred in connection with our acquisitions, and higher amortization of debt issuance costs. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of bank debt and repurchases of debt described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt Reduction." During the year ended December 31, 2002, we had average long term debt outstanding excluding our equity units of $5.2 billion compared to $4.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2001. Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001 was 53 basis points higher, increasing from 7.34% to 7.87% due to the impact of higher interest rates as a result of our refinancing our variable rate debt with fixed rate long term debt. Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $482.3 million as compared with the prior year period primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $400.1 million as compared with prior year period primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss). The effective tax rate for 2003 is 34.4% as compared with an effective tax rate of 33.7% for 2002. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 Amount Amount Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 65,769 $ (39,812) During the first quarter of 2003, as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," we recognized an after tax non cash gain of approximately $65.8 million. During the first quarter of 2002, as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," we recognized a transitional impairment loss of $39.8 million for goodwill related to ELI (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). 33 EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2001 Amount Extraordinary expense discontinuation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, net of tax $ 43,631 Extraordinary expense discontinuation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, net of tax, of $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, relates to the write off of regulatory assets and liabilities previously recognized under SFAS No. 71. Deregulation of most of our local exchange telephone properties required us to cease application of SFAS No. 71 in the third quarter, resulting in a non cash extraordinary charge of $43.6 million, net of tax, in our statement of operations. See discussion in Note 24 of Consolidated Financial Statements. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ($ in thousands) 2002 2001 Amount Amount Revenue $ 4,650 $ 116,868 Operating income (loss) $ (415) $ 37,211 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,478) $ 17,875 Gain on disposal of water segment, net of tax $ 181,369 $ Revenue, operating income (loss) and income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased as compared with the prior year period due to the sale of our water and wastewater businesses in January 2002. On January 15, 2002, we completed the sale of our water and wastewater operations for $859.1 million in cash and $122.5 million of assumed debt and other liabilities. The gain on the disposal of the water segment, net of tax, was $181.4 million. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity and commodity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business or to hedge long term interest rate risk. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity and commodity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio and interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. The long term debt and capital lease obligations include various instruments with various maturities and weighted average interest rates. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, a majority of our borrowings have fixed interest rates. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2003, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 In order to manage our interest rate risk exposure, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, we make semi annual, floating interest rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2003, the fair value of our long term debt and capital lease obligations excluding our equity units was estimated to be approximately $4.6 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 8.09% and our overall weighted maturity of 13 years. There has been no material change in the weighted average maturity since December 31, 2002. The overall weighted average interest rate increased in 2003 by approximately 4 basis points. A hypothetical increase of 81 basis points in our weighted average interest rate (10% of our overall weighted average borrowing rate) would result in an approximate $220.3 million decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in equity prices is minimal and relates primarily to the equity portion of our investment portfolio. The equity portion of our investment portfolio consists of equity securities (principally common stock) of D & E and Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp. (HTTC). As of December 31, 2003, we owned 3,059,000 shares of Adelphia common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we owned 2,305,908 common shares which represent an ownership of 19% of the equity in Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp., a company of which our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors. In addition, we hold 30,000 shares of non voting convertible preferred stock, each share having a liquidation value of $70 per share and are convertible at our option into 10 shares of common stock. The stock price of HTCC was $9.86 and $7.87 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we owned 1,333,500 shares of D & E common stock. The stock price of D & E was $14.51 and $8.36 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of equity price exposure At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio was estimated to be $44.3 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted market prices would result in an approximate $4.4 million decrease in the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio. Disclosure of limitations of sensitivity analysis Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value. This analysis incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2003. It does not consider those exposures or positions, which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate exposure with respect to our market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and the fluctuation of interest rates and quoted market prices.
