Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, words such as "believes", "anticipates", "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, any of the following possibilities: * Changes in the number of our revenue generating units, which consists of access lines plus high speed internet subscribers; * The effects of competition from wireless, other wireline carriers (through Unbundled Network Elements (UNE), Unbundled Network Elements Platform (UNEP), VOIP or otherwise), high speed cable modems and cable telephony; * The effects of general and local economic and employment conditions on our revenues; * Our ability to effectively manage and otherwise monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers, and our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset declines in highly profitable revenue from local services, access services and subsidies; * Our ability to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management to assess its internal control systems and disclose whether the internal control systems are effective, and the identification of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; * The effects of changes in regulation in the telecommunications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, including potential changes in access charges and subsidy payments, regulatory network upgrade and reliability requirements, and portability requirements; * Our ability to successfully renegotiate certain ILEC state regulatory plans as they expire or come up for renewal from time to time; * Our ability to manage our operating expenses, capital expenditures, pay dividends and reduce or refinance our debt; * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * The effects of bankruptcies in the telecommunications industry which could result in more price competition and potential bad debts; * The effects of technological changes on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; * The effects of increased medical expenses and related funding requirements; * The effect of changes in the telecommunications market, including the likelihood of significantly increased price and service competition; 15 * The effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; * Our ability to successfully renegotiate expiring union contracts covering approximately 78 employees that are scheduled to expire during 2005; * Our ability to pay a $1.00 per common share dividend annually may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and our liquidity; * The effects of any future liabilities or compliance costs in connection with environmental and worker health and safety matters; * The effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental, or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; and * The effects of more general factors, including changes in economic conditions; changes in the capital markets; changes in industry conditions; changes in our credit ratings; and changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators. You should consider these important factors in evaluating any statement in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. Overview We are a communications company providing services to rural areas and small and medium sized towns and cities as an incumbent local exchange carrier, or ILEC. We offer our ILEC services under the "Frontier" name. In addition, we provide competitive local exchange carrier, or CLEC, services to business customers and to other communications carriers in certain metropolitan areas in the western United States through Electric Lightwave, LLC, or ELI, our wholly owned subsidiary. Competition in the telecommunications industry is increasing. We experience competition from other wireline local carriers, VOIP providers such as Vonage, from other long distance carriers (including Regional Bell Operating Companies), from cable companies and internet service providers with respect to internet access and cable telephony, and from wireless carriers. Most of the wireline competition we face is in our Rochester, New York market, with competition also present in a few other markets. Competition from cable companies and other high speed internet service providers with respect to internet access is intense and increasing in many of our markets. The cable company in Rochester and other parts of our New York markets began offering a telephony product during 2004. We expect cable telephony competition to increase in Rochester and elsewhere during 2005. Competition from wireless companies and other long distance companies is increasing in all of our markets. The telecommunications industry is undergoing significant changes and difficulties. The market is extremely competitive, resulting in lower prices. Demand and pricing for certain CLEC services have decreased substantially, particularly for long haul services. These trends are likely to continue and result in a challenging revenue environment. These factors could also result in more bankruptcies in the sector and therefore affect our ability to collect money owed to us by carriers. Several long distance and IXCs have filed for bankruptcy protection, which will allow them to substantially reduce their cost structure and debt. This could enable such companies to further reduce prices and increase competition. Revenues from data services such as high speed internet continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from high margin services such as local line and access charges and subsidies are decreasing as a percentage of our revenues. These factors, along with increasing operating and employee costs will cause our cash generated by operations to decrease. 16 (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2004, we used cash flows from continuing operations, the proceeds from the sale of utility properties and investments, cash and cash equivalents to fund capital expenditures, dividends, interest payments, a $20.0 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan and debt repayments. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $167.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our capital expenditures were $276.3 million, including $264.3 million for the ILEC segment, $11.6 million for the ELI segment and $0.4 million of general capital expenditures. We continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. For example, in 2005 we will allocate significant capital to services such as high speed internet in areas that are growing or demonstrate meaningful demand. In the past, large capital outlays were made in newly acquired properties to be able to offer all of our services across all of our areas and in order to improve network capability and service quality. After those investments were made, the total amount of capital spending has been further reduced because of declining revenues and lower costs from vendors. We will continue to focus on managing our costs while increasing our investment in certain product areas such as high speed internet. Increasing competition, offering new services or a decision to improve the capabilities and reduce the maintenance costs of our plant may cause our capital expenditures to increase in the future. We have budgeted approximately $270.0 million for our 2005 capital projects including $255.0 million for the ILEC segment and $15.0 million for the ELI segment. Included in these budgeted capital amounts are approximately $6.9 million of capital expenditures associated with CALEA. We have received extensions of time to make our entire network CALEA compliant, however, failure to be granted further extensions could increase our budgeted capital expenditures by up to $6.2 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2004, we have available lines of credit with financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $250.0 million. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our debt leverage ratio, and are 0.375% per annum as of December 31, 2004. The expiration date for the facility is October 29, 2009. During the term of the facility we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments. There are no outstanding advances under the facility. In July 2004, our Board of Directors concluded a review of financial and strategic alternatives. After analysis of alternatives by the Board of Directors and its financial and legal advisors, the Board determined to pay a special, non recurring dividend of $2 per common share and institute a regular annual dividend of $1 per share of Common Stock which will be paid quarterly. The special, non recurring dividend and first quarterly dividend were paid on September 2, 2004 utilizing the Companys cash on hand. The next quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share of Common Stock was paid on December 31, 2004. The $832.8 million of dividends paid during 2004 significantly reduced our cash balances and liquidity. In addition, our ongoing annual dividends of approximately $340.0 million will reduce our operating and financial flexibility and our ability to significantly increase capital expenditures. While we believe that the amount of our dividends will allow for adequate amounts of cash flow for other purposes, any reduction in cash generated by operations and any increases in capital expenditures, interest expense or cash taxes would reduce the amount of cash generated in excess of dividends. Losses of access lines, increases in competition, lower subsidy and access revenues and the other factors described above is expected to reduce our cash generated by operations and may require us to increase capital expenditures. The downgrades in our credit ratings in July 2004 to below investment grade may make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt. We have in recent years paid relatively low amounts of cash taxes. We expect that over time our cash taxes will increase. As a result of the adoption of our dividend policy, Standard and Poors lowered its ratings on Citizens debt from "BBB" to "BB plus", Moodys Investors Service lowered its ratings from "Baa3" to "Ba3" and Fitch Ratings lowered its ratings from "BBB" to "BB". We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and credit facilities will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt payments through 2007, pay dividends to our shareholders in accordance with our dividend policy, and support our short term and long term operating strategies. We have approximately $6.4 million, $227.8 million and $37.9 million of debt maturing in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. 17 Issuance of Common Stock On August 17, 2004 we issued 32,073,633 shares of common stock, including 3,591,000 treasury shares, to our equity unit holders in settlement of the equity purchase contract component of the equity units. With respect to the $460.0 million senior note component of the equity units, we repurchased $300.0 million principal amount of these notes in July 2004. The remaining $160.0 million of the senior notes were repriced and a portion was remarketed on August 12, 2004 as the 6.75% notes due August 17, 2006. During August and September, 2004, we repurchased an additional $108.2 million of the 6.75% notes which, in addition to the $300.0 million purchased in July, resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately $20.1 million during the third quarter of 2004, but will result in an annual reduction in interest expense of about $27.6 million per year. See discussion below concerning EPPICS conversions for further information regarding the issuance of common stock. Issuance of Debt Securities On November 8, 2004, we issued an aggregate $700.0 million principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due January 15, 2013 through a registered underwritten public offering. Proceeds from the sale were used to redeem our outstanding $700.0 million of 8.50% Notes due 2006, which is discussed below. Debt Reduction For the year ended December 31, 2004, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $1,362.0 million of debt, including $148.0 million of EPPICS that were converted to our common stock. On January 15, 2004, we repaid at maturity the remaining outstanding $81.0 million of our 7.45% Debentures. On January 15, 2004, we redeemed at 101% the remaining outstanding $12.3 million of our Hawaii Special Purpose Revenue Bonds, Series 1993A and Series 1993B. On May 17, 2004, we repaid at maturity the remaining outstanding $6.0 million of Electric Lightwave, LLCs 6.05% Notes. These Notes had been guaranteed by Citizens. On July 15, 2004, we renegotiated and prepaid with $5.0 million of cash the entire remaining $5.5 million ELI capital lease obligation to a third party. On July 30, 2004, we purchased $300.0 million of the 6.75% notes that were a component of our equity units at 105.075% of par, plus accrued interest, at a premium of approximately $15.2 million. During August and September 2004, we repurchased through a series of transactions an additional $108.2 million of the 6.75% notes due 2006 at a weighted average price of 104.486% of par, plus accrued interest, at a premium of approximately $4.9 million. On November 12, 2004, we called for redemption on December 13, 2004 the entire $700.0 million of our 8.50% notes due 2006 at a price of 107.182% of the principal amount called, plus accrued interest, at a premium of approximately $50.3 million. We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market, through tender offers or privately negotiated transactions. Interest Rate Management In order to manage our interest expense, we have entered into interest swap agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, we make semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. The underlying variable rate on these swaps is set either in advance, in arrears or based on each periods daily average six month LIBOR. The notional amounts of fixed rate indebtedness hedged as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were $300.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively. Such contracts require us to pay variable rates of interest (average pay rate of approximately 6.12% as of December 31, 2004) and receive fixed rates of interest (average receive rate of 8.44% as of December 31, 2004). All swaps are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 as fair value hedges. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the interest savings resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $9.4 million. 18 As the result of our call of all of our 8.50% Notes due 2006 in November 2004, we terminated five interest rate swaps used to hedge our interest rate exposure on that issue, each swap having a notional amount of $50.0 million. Proceeds from the swap terminations of approximately $3.0 million and U.S. Treasury rate lock agreements of approximately $1.0 million were used to offset the call premium associated with the notes retired. Sale of Non Strategic Investments On August 13, 2004, we sold our entire 1,333,500 shares of D & E Communications, Inc. (D & E) for approximately $13.3 million in cash. On September 3, 2004, we sold our entire holdings of 2,605,908 common share equivalents in Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp. (HTCC) for approximately $13.2 million in cash. During the third quarter of 2004, we sold our corporate aircraft for approximately $15.3 million in cash. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationship with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 is as follows: Payment due by period Contractual Obligations: Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years ($ in thousands) Long term debt obligations, excluding interest (see Note 11) (1) $ 4,219,054 $ 6,302 $ 265,464 $ 751,938 $ 3,195,350 Capital lease obligations (see Note 26) 4,421 81 204 271 3,865 Operating lease obligations (see Note 26) 104,992 21,198 26,765 21,535 35,494 Purchase obligations (see Note 26) 70,880 35,831 33,159 900 990 Other long term liabilities (2) 63,765 63,765 Total $ 4,463,112 $ 63,412 $ 325,592 $ 774,644 $ 3,299,464 (1) Includes interest rate swaps ($4.5 million). (2) Consists of our Equity Providing Preferred Income Convertible Securities (EPPICS) reflected on our balance sheet. At December 31, 2004, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $22.4 million. Management Succession and Strategic Alternatives Expenses On July 11, 2004, our Board of Directors announced that it completed its review of the Companys financial and strategic alternatives. In 2004, we expensed approximately $90.6 million of costs related to management succession and our exploration of financial and strategic alternatives. Included are $36.6 million of non cash expenses for the acceleration of stock benefits, cash expenses of $19.2 million for advisory fees, $19.3 million for severance and retention arrangements and $15.5 million primarily for tax reimbursements. 19 EPPICS In 1996, our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust (the Trust), issued, in an underwritten public offering, 4,025,000 shares of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 (Trust Convertible Preferred Securities or EPPICS), representing preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust, with a liquidation preference of $50 per security (for a total liquidation amount of $201.3 million). These securities have an adjusted conversion price of $11.46 per Citizens common share. The conversion price was reduced from $13.30 to $11.46 during the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the $2.00 per share special, non recurring dividend. The proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase $207.5 million aggregate liquidation amount of 5% Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 from another wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Capital L.P. (the Partnership). The proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase from us $211.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2036. The sole assets of the Trust are the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities, and our Convertible Subordinated Debentures are substantially all the assets of the Partnership. Our obligations under the agreements related to the issuances of such securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trusts obligations relating to the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and the Partnerships obligations relating to the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities. In accordance with the terms of the issuances, we paid the annual 5% interest in quarterly installments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Only cash was paid (net of investment returns) to the Partnership in payment of the interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The cash was then distributed by the Partnership to the Trust and then by the Trust to the holders of the EPPICS. As of December 31, 2004, EPPICS representing a total principal amount of $148.0 million had been converted into 11,622,749 shares of Citizens common stock, and a total of $53.3 million EPPICS remains outstanding. We have adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," effective January 1, 2004. We have not restated prior periods. We have included the following description to provide readers a comparative analysis of the accounting impact of this standard. Both the Trust and the Partnership have been consolidated from the date of their creation through December 31, 2003. As a result of the new consolidation standards established by FIN 46R, the Company, effective January 1, 2004, deconsolidated the activities of the Trust and the Partnership. We have highlighted the comparative effect of this change in the following table: Balance Sheet As of ($ in thousands) December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 Change Assets: Cash $ 2,103 $ $ (2,103) (1) Investments 12,645 12,645 (2) Liabilities: Long term debt 63,765 (3) (137,485) (3) EPPICS 201,250 (3) Statement of Operations As reported for the year ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 Change Investment income $ $ 632 $ 632 (4) Interest expense 8,082 8,082 (5) Dividends on EPPICS (before tax) 10,063 (10,063) (6) Net $ 10,063 $ 7,450 $ (2,613) (1) Represents a cash balance on the books of the Partnership that is removed as a result of the deconsolidation. (2) Represents Citizens investments in the Partnership and the Trust. At December 31, 2003, these investments were eliminated in consolidation against the equity of the Partnership and the Trust. 20 (3) As a result of the deconsolidation, the Trust and the Partnership balance sheets were removed, leaving debt issued by Citizens to the Partnership in the amount of $211.8 million. The nominal effect of an increase in debt of $10.5 million is debt that is "intercompany." As of December 31, 2004, Citizens has $53.3 million ($63.8 million less $10.5 million of intercompany debt) of debt outstanding to third parties and will continue to pay interest on that amount at 5%. (4) Represents interest income to be paid by the Partnership and the Trust to Citizens for its investments noted in (2) above. The Partnership and the Trust have no source of cash except as provided by Citizens. Interest is payable at the rate of 5% per annum. (5) Represents interest expense on the convertible debentures issued by Citizens to the partnership. Interest is payable at the rate of 5% per annum. (6) As a result of the deconsolidation of the Trust, previously reported dividends on the convertible preferred securities issued to the public by the Trust are removed and replaced by the interest accruing on the debt issued by Citizens to the Partnership. Citizens remains the guarantor of the EPPICS debt and continues to be the sole source of cash for the Trust to pay dividends. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facilities agreements include the timely and punctual payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract, rule or regulation. Our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC) contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.25 to 1 through December 30, 2004, and 4.00 to 1 thereafter. Our new $250 million credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.50 to 1. Although the new credit facility is unsecured, it will be equally and ratably secured by certain liens and equally and ratably guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries if we issue debt that is secured or guaranteed. We are in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture for our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. As of April 1, 2004, we sold all of these properties. All of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities (typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale), including environmental liabilities, for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement. On January 15, 2002, we sold our water and wastewater services operations for $859.1 million in cash and $122.5 million in assumed debt and other liabilities. On October 31, 2002, we completed the sale of approximately 4,000 access lines in North Dakota for approximately $9.7 million in cash. On November 1, 2002, we completed the sale of our Kauai electric division for $215.0 million in cash. On April 1, 2003, we completed the sale of approximately 11,000 access lines in North Dakota for approximately $25.7 million in cash. On April 4, 2003, we completed the sale of our wireless partnership interest in Wisconsin for approximately $7.5 million in cash. On August 8, 2003, we completed the sale of The Gas Company in Hawaii division for $119.3 million in cash and assumed liabilities. On August 11, 2003, we completed the sale of our Arizona gas and electric divisions for $224.1 million in cash. 21 On December 2, 2003, we completed the sale of our electric transmission facilities in Vermont for $7.3 million in cash. On April 1, 2004, we completed the sale of our electric distribution facilities in Vermont for $14.0 million in cash, net of selling expenses. In February 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Conference Call USA, LLC, (CCUSA) our conferencing services business for $41.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments under the terms of the agreement. This transaction is expected to close by March 31, 2005. CCUSA had revenues of $24.6 million and operating income of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, CCUSAs net assets totaled $24.4 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, employee benefit plans, income taxes, contingencies, and pension and postretirement benefits expenses among others. Telecommunications Bankruptcies Our estimate of anticipated losses related to telecommunications bankruptcies is a "critical accounting estimate." We have significant on going normal course business relationships with many telecom providers, some of which have filed for bankruptcy. We generally reserve approximately 95% of the net outstanding pre bankruptcy balances owed to us and believe that our estimate of the net realizable value of the amounts owed to us by bankrupt entities is appropriate. Asset Impairment Our asset impairment charges in 2002 were critical estimates. In 2003 and 2004, we had no "critical estimates" related to asset impairments. Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results. Our depreciation expense has decreased substantially from prior periods as a result of the impairment write down we recorded during 2002, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the increase in the average depreciable lives for certain of our equipment. Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, our reporting unit is the ILEC segment. In determining fair value of goodwill during 2004 we compared the net book value of the ILEC assets to trading values of the Companys publicly traded common stock. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill. An independent third party appraiser analyzed trade name. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other post retirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are "critical accounting estimates." We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our employees and other post retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance benefits and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The accounting results for pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. The Company reviews these assumptions for changes annually with its outside actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. 22 The discount rate is used to value, on a present basis, our pension and post retirement benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and post retirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the interest rates for long term high quality corporate bonds. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. Our discount rate declined from 6.25% at year end 2003 to 6.0% at year end 2004. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and post retirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year and 10 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 30% to 45% in fixed income securities and 55% to 70% in equity securities. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. In 2004, we did not change our expected long term rate of return from the 8.25% used in 2003. Our pension plan assets are valued at actual market value as of the measurement date. Accounting standards require that we record an additional minimum pension liability when the plans "accumulated benefit obligation" exceeds the fair market value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement (balance sheet) date. In the fourth quarter of 2003, due to strong performance in the equity markets during 2003, partially offset by a decrease in the year end discount rate, the Company recorded a reduction to its minimum pension liability in the amount of $35.0 million with a corresponding increase to shareholders equity of $22.0 million, net of taxes of $13.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2004, mainly due to a decrease in the year end discount rate, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability in the amount of $17.4 million with a corresponding charge to shareholders equity of $10.7 million, net of taxes of $6.7 million. These adjustments did not impact our earnings or cash flows. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are added or subtracted to our balance of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses. For example, if the year end discount rate used to value the plans projected benefit obligation decreases from the prior year end then the plans actuarial loss will increase. If the discount rate increases from the prior year end then the plans actuarial loss will decrease. Similarly, the difference generated from the plans actual asset performance as compared to expected performance would be included in the balance of unrecognized gains and losses. The impact of the balance of accumulated actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the computation of pension cost only to the extent this balance exceeds 10% of the greater of the plans projected benefit obligation or market value of plan assets. If this occurs, that portion of gain or loss that is in excess of 10% is amortized over the estimated future service period of plan participants as a component of pension cost. The level of amortization is affected each year by the change in actuarial gains and losses and could potentially be eliminated if the gain/loss activity reduces the net accumulated gain/loss balance to a level below the 10% threshold. We expect that our pension expense for 2005 will be $5.0 million to $7.0 million (it was $3.6 million in 2004) and no contribution will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2005. In October 2004, we made a voluntary contribution of $20.0 million to the pension plan. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate has declined as a result of the completion of audits with federal and state taxing authorities during 2004 and changes in the structure of certain of our subsidiaries. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. 23 New Accounting Pronouncements Goodwill and Other Intangibles In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment. We have no intangibles with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill and trade name. The amortization of goodwill and trade name ceased upon adoption of the statement on January 1, 2002. We were required to test for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives as of January 1, 2002 and at least annually thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss at January 1, 2002 was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, we recognized a transitional impairment loss related to ELI of $39.8 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in 2002. We annually examine the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangibles with estimated useful lives to determine whether there are any impairment losses and have determined for the year ended December 31, 2004 that there was no impairment. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over those lives and be reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." We reassess the useful life of our intangible assets with estimated useful lives annually. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 is discussed in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 applies to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, and addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the assets and requires that a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized when incurred, recorded at fair value and classified as a liability in the balance sheet. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity will capitalize the cost and increase the carrying value of the related long lived asset. The liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. At the settlement date, the entity will settle the obligation for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss upon settlement. Depreciation expense for our wireline operations had historically included an additional provision for cost of removal. Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, on January 1, 2003, the Company ceased recognition of the cost of removal provision in depreciation expense and eliminated the cumulative cost of removal included in accumulated depreciation, as the Company has no legal obligation to remove certain long lived assets. The cumulative effect of retroactively applying these changes to periods prior to January 1, 2003, resulted in an after tax non cash gain of approximately $65.8 million recognized in 2003. Long Lived Assets In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, for impairment of long lived assets held and used and for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2002. Debt Retirement In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." This statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. The statement requires gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" which provides guidance for distinguishing transactions that are part of an entitys recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. We adopted SFAS No. 145 in the second quarter of 2002. 24 During the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized $66.5 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of losses from the early retirement of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized $5.6 million of gains from early debt retirement. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a $12.8 million loss due to a tender offer related to certain debt securities. These gains/losses were recorded in other income (loss), net. Exit or Disposal Activities In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which nullified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than on the date of commitment to an exit plan. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Guarantees In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that a guarantor be required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under the guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with the guarantee. The provisions of FIN 45 are effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted FIN 45 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Stock Based Compensation In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. This statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the expanded disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment," ("SFAS No. 123R"). SFAS No. 123R requires that stock based employee compensation be recorded as a charge to earnings for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we will adopt SFAS No. 123R commencing July 1, 2005 (third quarter) and expect to recognize approximately $3.0 million of expense for the last six months of 2005. Derivative Instruments and Hedging In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging," which clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. This Statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. We adopted SFAS No. 149 on July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Generally, SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 25 Variable Interest Entities In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which was issued in January 2003. We are required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in variable interest entities or VIEs created after December 31, 2003. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE. We reviewed all of our investments and determined that the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities (EPPICS), issued by our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust and the related Citizens Utilities Capital L.P., were our only VIEs. The adoption of FIN 46R on January 1, 2004 did not have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." SFAS No. 132 retains and revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original statement. It requires additional disclosures including information describing the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date(s), plan obligations, cash flows, and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized in interim periods. SFAS No. 132 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. We adopted the expanded disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132 (revised). Investments In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03 1, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" (EITF 03 1) which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF 03 1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed not to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03 1; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our year ended December 31, 2004. Although we have no material investments at the present time, we will evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF 03 1 when final guidance is released. (b) Results of Operations REVENUE ILEC revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance and data services. Such services are provided under either a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at a tariffed rate and are not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. CLEC revenue is generated through local, long distance, data and long haul services. These services are primarily provided under a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at agreed upon rates and are not dependent upon significant judgments by management with the exception of the determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts and realizability of reciprocal compensation. CLEC usage based revenue includes amounts determined under reciprocal compensation agreements. While this revenue is governed by specific contracts with the counterparty, management defers recognition of disputed portions of such revenue until realizability is assured. Revenue earned from long haul contracts is recognized over the term of the related agreement. Consolidated revenue decreased $252.0 million, or 10% in 2004. The decrease in 2004 was primarily due to $228.9 million of decreased gas and electric revenue primarily due to the disposition of our Arizona gas and electric operations, The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Vermont electric division and $23.1 million of decreased telecommunications revenue. Consolidated revenue decreased $224.4 million, or 8% in 2003. The decrease in 2003 was primarily due to $192.7 million of decreased gas and electric revenue primarily due to the disposition of our Arizona gas and electric operations and The Gas Company in Hawaii division and $31.7 million of decreased telecommunications revenue. 26 Consolidated revenue increased $212.3 million, or 9%, in 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to $420.5 million of increased telecommunications revenue, largely due to the impact of the Frontier acquisition on June 29, 2001, partially offset by $195.0 million of decreased gas revenue largely due to the disposition of the Louisiana and Colorado gas operations and the disposition of the Kauai electric division. On October 31, 2002 and April 1, 2003, we sold approximately 4,000 and 11,000 telephone access lines, respectively, in North Dakota. The revenues related to these access lines totaled $1.9 million; $10.2 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Change in the number of our access lines is the most fundamental driver of changes in our telecommunications revenue. We have been losing access lines primarily because of difficult economic conditions, increased competition from competitive wireline providers, from wireless providers and from cable companies (with respect to broadband and cable telephony), and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add high speed internet or cable modem service. We lost approximately 65,700 access lines during 2004 but added approximately 91,800 high speed internet subscribers during this period. The loss of lines during 2004 was primarily among residential customers. The non residential line losses were principally in Rochester, New York, while the residential losses were throughout our markets. We expect to continue to lose access lines but to increase high speed internet subscribers during 2005. A continued loss of access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed in MD&A, will cause our revenues to decrease in 2005. In addition, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell our conferencing services business, which had revenue of $24.6 million during 2004. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Access services $ 634,196 $ (32,846) 5% $ 667,042 $ (24,852) 4% $ 691,894 Local services 851,177 (7,825) 1% 859,002 8,683 1% 850,319 Long distance and data services 321,854 15,020 5% 306,834 7,508 3% 299,326 Directory services 110,623 3,689 3% 106,934 2,551 2% 104,383 Other 109,365 8,242 8% 101,123 (15,860) 14% 116,983 ILEC revenue 2,027,215 (13,720) 1% 2,040,935 (21,970) 1% 2,062,905 ELI 156,030 (9,359) 6% 165,389 (9,690) 6% 175,079 $2,183,245 $ (23,079) 1% $2,206,324 $ (31,660) 1% $2,237,984 Access Services Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $32.8 million or 5%, as compared with the prior year. Switched access revenue decreased $19.6 million primarily due to $8.3 million attributable to a decline in minutes of use, the $7.4 million effect of federally mandated access rate reductions and $2.7 million associated with state intrastate access rate reductions. Access service revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies. Subsidies revenue decreased $12.8 million primarily due to an $8.3 million decline in federal Universal Service Fund (USF) support because of increases in the national average cost per loop, including a $3.5 million accrual recorded during the third quarter of 2004 for mistakes made during 2002 and 2003 by the agency that calculates subsidy payments and true ups related to 2002. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in USF surcharge revenue of $2.1 million resulting from a rate increase. Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $24.9 million or 4% as compared with the prior year. Switched access revenue decreased $20.7 million primarily due to the $18.1 million effect of federally mandated access rate reductions, $2.6 million in increased disputes and $1.2 million related to the sale of our North Dakota exchanges. Special access revenue increased $4.6 million primarily due to growth in special (point to point) circuits of $8.4 million partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million attributable to the sale of our North Dakota exchanges and $1.2 million in increased disputes. Subsidy revenue decreased $8.7 million primarily due to decreased USF support of $11.8 million partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million in USF surcharge rates. We currently expect that our subsidy revenue in 2005 will be at least $20.0 million lower than 2004 because of the improvement in prior years in the profitability of our operations and lower expenses and capital expenditures in prior years than previously anticipated, and because of increases in the national average cost per loop (NACPL). Increases in the number of competitive communications companies (including wireless companies) receiving federal subsidies may lead to further increases in the NACPL, thereby resulting in further decreases in our subsidy revenue in the future. The FCC and state regulators are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the 27 amounts of such subsidies. The FCC is also reviewing the mechanism by which subsidies are funded. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided nor the effect on our subsidy revenues. Our subsidy and access revenues are very profitable so any reductions in those revenues will reduce our profitability. Local Services Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $7.8 million or 1% as compared with the prior year. Local revenue decreased $17.9 million primarily due to $4.7 million related to continued losses of access lines, $2.2 million as a result of refunds to customers because of state earnings limitations, the termination of an operator services contract of $3.4 million, $3.5 million in decreased local measured service revenue and a decline of $2.0 million in certain business services revenue. Enhanced services revenue increased $10.1 million, primarily due to sales of additional feature packages. Economic conditions or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our packages and bundles and cause us to lower our prices for those products and services, which would adversely affect our revenues. Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $8.7 million, or 1% as compared with the prior year. Local revenue decreased $1.1 million primarily due to a $7.6 million decrease from continued losses of access lines and the $4.0 million impact of the sale of our North Dakota exchanges in 2003, partially offset by an $10.4 million increase in subscriber line charges due to rate changes. Enhanced services revenue increased $9.8 million primarily due to the sale of additional feature packages. Long Distance and Data Services Long distance and data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $15.0 million or 5%, as compared with the prior year. Data services (data includes high speed internet) increased primarily due to growth of $30.7 million, partially offset by decreased long distance revenue of $15.8 million primarily attributable to a 21% decline in the average rate per minute. Our long distance minutes of use increased approximately 6.0% during 2004. Our long distance revenues could decrease in the future due to lower long distance minutes of use because consumers are increasingly using their wireless phones or calling cards to make long distance calls and lower average rates per minute because of unlimited and packages of minutes for long distance plans. We expect these factors will continue to adversely affect our long distance revenues during 2005. Long distance and data services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $7.5 million or 3% as compared with the prior year primarily due to growth of $17.6 million related to data services, partially offset by a decrease of $10.0 million in long distance revenue. Our long distance revenues decreased during 2003 due to lower average rates per minute related to the introduction of new products including unlimited long distance and lower long distance minutes of use because consumers are increasingly using their wireless phones or calling cards to make long distance calls. Directory Services Directory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $3.7 million or 3%, as compared with the prior year due to growth in yellow pages advertising. Directory revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.6 million or 2%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to growth in yellow pages advertising. Other Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $8.2 million or 8%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to a $4.1 million carrier dispute settlement, $3.6 million in increased conferencing revenue, a decline in bad debt expense of $3.2 million and an increase in service activation revenue of $2.5 million, partially offset by decreases of $3.6 million in sales of customer premise equipment (CPE) and $1.5 million in call center services revenue. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $15.9 million, or 14% compared with the prior year primarily due to $7.8 million in increased dispute reserves, the termination in 2002 of $2.5 million in contract services provided to Global Crossing and a decrease of $2.0 million in CPE sales. In addition, revenue from collocation/rents declined $1.1 million and conferencing revenue decreased $1.0 million. 28 ELI ELI revenue for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 decreased $9.4 million, or 6%, and $9.7 million, or 6%, respectively, primarily due to lower demand and prices for long haul services and lower reciprocal compensation revenues.

Gas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $78.8 million, or 36%, as compared with the prior year due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Arizona gas division, which were sold on August 8, 2003 and August 11, 2003, respectively. Electric revenue Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $91.2 million, or 90%, as compared with the prior year. We completed the sale of our remaining electric utility property on April 1, 2004. We have sold all of our electric operations and as a result will have no operating results in future periods for these businesses. Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $113.9 million, or 53%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the sales of our Arizona electric division and Kauai Electric. Included in electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 is approximately $183.5 million of revenue from our Arizona electric division and Kauai Electric, which were sold on August 11, 2003 and November 1, 2002, respectively. We had just one remaining electric utility property as of December 31, 2003.

ELI costs have declined due to a drop in demand coupled with improved network cost efficiencies. If we continue to increase our sales of data products such as high speed internet or expand the availability of our unlimited calling plans, our network access expense could increase. Network access expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $11.9 million, or 5%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to decreased costs in long distance access expense related to rate changes partially offset by increased circuit expense associated with additional data product sales in the ILEC sector. ELI costs have declined due to a drop in demand coupled with improved network cost efficiencies. Gas purchased We did not have any gas operations in the year ended December 31, 2004. Gas purchased for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $40.6 million, or 33%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Arizona gas division. 29 Electric energy and fuel oil purchased Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $58.3 million, or 91%, as compared with the prior year. We completed the sale of our remaining electric utility property on April 1, 2004. We have sold all of our electric operations and as a result will have no operating results in future periods for these businesses. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $54.7 million, or 46%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the sales of our Arizona electric division and Kauai Electric. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Operating expenses $630,669 $ (61,580) 9% $ 692,249 $ (70,624) 9% $ 762,873 Taxes other than income taxes 94,481 (2,638) 3% 97,119 (34,139) 26% 131,258 Sales and marketing 115,036 2,653 2% 112,383 4,159 4% 108,224 $ 840,186 $ (61,565) 7% $ 901,751 $ (100,604) 10% $1,002,355 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $61.6 million, or 9%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to decreased operating expenses in the public services sector due to the sales of our utilities and increased operating efficiencies and a reduction of personnel in our communications business. We routinely review our operations, personnel and facilities to achieve greater efficiencies. These reviews may result in reductions in personnel and an increase in severance costs. Included in operating expenses are expenses attributable to our efforts to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. As of December 31, 2004, we have incurred approximately $4.2 million in connection with this initiative. Included in operating expenses is stock compensation expense. Compensation arrangements entered into in connection with management succession and strategic alternatives will result in stock compensation expense of approximately $5.2 million in 2005, $5.1 million in 2006 and $1.0 million in 2007. In addition, during the third quarter of 2005, we will begin expensing the cost of the unvested portion of outstanding stock options pursuant to SFAS No. 123R. We expect to recognize approximately $3.0 million of expense for the last six months of 2005. Included in operating expenses is pension expense. In future periods, if the value of our pension assets decline and or projected benefit costs increase, we may have increased pension expenses. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our pension expense will increase from $3.6 million in 2004 to approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million in 2005 and that no contribution to our pension plans will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2005. In addition, as medical costs increase the costs of our postretirement benefit costs also increase. Our retiree medical costs for 2004 were $16.6 million and our current estimate for 2005 is approximately $17.0 million. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $70.6 million, or 9%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to increased operating efficiencies and a reduction of personnel in the ILEC and ELI sectors (310 fewer employees than 2002) and decreased operating expenses in the gas and electric sectors due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii ($11.3 million), our Arizona gas and electric divisions ($16.4 million) and Kauai Electric ($21.5 million). Expenses were negatively impacted by increased compensation expense of $1.5 million related to variable stock plans and increased pension expenses. Taxes Other than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $2.6 million, or 3%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to decreased property taxes in the public services sector due to the sales of our utilities and lower gross receipts taxes of $3.7 million in the ILEC sector that were partially offset by higher payroll, property and franchise taxes of $13.0 million. Taxes other than income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $34.1 million, or 26%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to decreased property taxes at ELI as a result of lower asset values and the sales of our utilities. 30 Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $2.7 million, or 2%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to increased costs in the ILEC sector. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $4.2 million, or 4%, as compared to the prior year due to increased marketing costs in the ILEC sector primarily related to enhanced services and high speed internet. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Depreciation expense $ 446,190 $ (22,248) 5% $ 468,438 $ (161,675) 26% $ 630,113 Amortization expense 126,520 (318) 0% 126,838 1,429 1% 125,409 $ 572,710 $ (22,566) 4% $ 595,276 $ (160,246) 21% $ 755,522 Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $22.2 million, or 5% as compared to the prior year because the net asset base is declining. Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $161.7 million, or 26%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the ELI impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2002, which reduced ELIs asset base, the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the increase in the average depreciable lives for certain of our equipment. Accelerated depreciation in 2002 of $23.4 million relating to the closing of our Plano, Texas facility also contributed to the decrease. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $1.4 million, or 1% as compared with the prior year primarily due to the receipt of the final valuation report of our Frontier acquisition during the second quarter of 2002, which resulted in an increase in our customer base. RESERVE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS BANKRUPTCIES / RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES / MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Reserve for (recovery of) telecommunications bankruptcies $ $ 4,377 100% $ (4,377) $ (15,257) 140% $ 10,880 Restructuring and other expenses $ $ (9,687) 100% $ 9,687 $ (27,499) 74% $ 37,186 Management succession and strategic alternatives expenses $ 90,632 $ 90,632 100% $ $ 0% $ Management succession and strategic alternatives expenses in 2004 include a mix of cash retention payments, equity awards and severance agreements (see Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion). During the fourth quarter of 2003, an agreement with WorldCom/MCI settling all pre bankruptcy petition obligations and receivables was approved by the bankruptcy court. This settlement resulted in reduction to our reserve of approximately $6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. During the second quarter of 2003, we reserved approximately $2.3 million of trade receivables with Touch America as a result of Touch Americas filing for bankruptcy. These receivables were generated as a result of providing ordinary course telecommunication services. If other telecommunications companies file for bankruptcy, we may have additional significant reserves in future periods. Concurrent with the acquisition of Frontier, we entered into several operating agreements with Global Crossing. We have ongoing commercial relationships with Global Crossing affiliates. We reserved a total of $29.0 million of Global Crossing receivables during 2001 and 2002 as a result of Global Crossings filing for bankruptcy to reflect our best estimate of the net realizable value of receivables resulting from these commercial relationships. We recorded a write down of such receivables in the amount of $7.8 million in 2002 and $21.2 million in 2001. In 2002, as the result of a settlement agreement with Global Crossing, we reversed $17.9 million of our previous write down reserve of the net realizable value of these receivables. 31 Restructuring and other expenses for 2003 primarily consist of severance expenses related to reductions in personnel at our telecommunications operations and the write off of software no longer used. LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 Amount Amount Loss on impairment $ 15,300 $ 1,074,058 During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, we recognized additional pre tax impairment losses of $4.0 million and $11.3 million related to our Vermont property to write down assets to be sold to our best estimate of their net realizable value upon sale. In the third quarter of 2002, we recognized non cash pre tax impairment losses of $656.7 million related to property, plant and equipment in the ELI sector and $417.4 million related to the gas and electric sector assets held for sale. Our assessment of impairment for ELI was a result of continued losses at ELI and continued actual revenue declines in excess of projected revenue declines. The gas and electric sector impairments were associated with the sale of our Arizona and Hawaii gas and electric properties at prices that were less than the previous carrying values and the write down of our remaining utility to our best estimate of net realizable sales price. Previously, we believed that the net realizable value of these properties was equal to or above their carrying values. However, as a result of market conditions, and the desire to complete the divestiture process quickly in order to focus on our core telecommunications operations and raise money to further reduce debt, in the third quarter of 2002 we made a strategic decision to accept proceeds less than carrying values rather than continue to market these properties for higher prices (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above).

Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $108.8 million as compared to prior year primarily due to the recognition in 2002 of non cash pre tax losses of $95.3 million resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in Adelphia and $16.4 million resulting from an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in D & E (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by lower income in 2003 from money market balances and short term investments. Other Income (Loss) Other loss, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $97.3 million as compared to prior year primarily due to a pre tax loss from the early extinguishment of debt of $66.5 million in 2004, and the recognition in 2003 of $69.5 million in non cash pre tax gains related to a capital lease termination and a capital lease restructuring at ELI, partially offset in 2004 by $25.3 million in income from the expiration of certain retained liabilities at less than face value, which are associated with customer advances for construction from our disposed water properties and a net loss on sales of assets in 2004 of $1.9 million, which is primarily attributable to the loss on the sale of our corporate aircraft, compared to a net loss on sales of assets in 2003 of $20.5 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $21.5 million, or 95%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to $69.5 million in non cash pre tax gains in 2003 related to capital lease restructurings at ELI, $6.2 million of income in 2003 from the settlement of certain retained liabilities at less than face value, which are associated with customer advances for construction from our disposed water properties, a decrease of $20.1 million compared to income of $26.3 million in 2002, partially offset by a net loss on sales of assets in 2003 of $20.5 million, compared with the prior years gain of $9.8 million, primarily due to the sales of The Gas Company in Hawaii and our Arizona gas and electric divisions, the sale of access lines in North Dakota and 32 our wireless partnership interest in Wisconsin, and the sale of our Plano, Texas office building. During 2003, we executed a series of purchases in the open market of our outstanding notes and debentures that generated a pre tax loss from the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.1 million. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $37.5 million, or 9%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the retirement of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we had average long term debt (excluding equity units and convertible preferred stock) outstanding of $4.2 billion compared to $4.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003. Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with the prior year period was 11 basis points lower, decreasing from 8.07% to 7.96%. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $51.7 million, or 11%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the retirement of debt partially offset by higher average interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we had average long term debt (excluding equity units and convertible preferred stock) outstanding of $4.6 billion compared to $5.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002. Our weighted average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with the prior year period was 20 basis points higher, increasing from 7.87% to 8.07%, due to the repayment of debt with interest rates below our average rate. Income Taxes Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $53.8 million, or 80%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss). Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $482.1 million as compared with the prior year primarily due to changes in taxable income (loss). The effective tax rate for 2004 is 15.6% as compared with an effective tax rate of 34.4% for 2003. Our effective tax rate has declined as a result of the completion of audits with federal and state taxing authorities during 2004 and changes in the structure of certain of our subsidiaries. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE ($ in thousands) 2003 2002 Amount Amount Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ 65,769 $ (39,812) During the first quarter of 2003, as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," we recognized an after tax non cash gain of approximately $65.8 million. During the first quarter of 2002, as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," we recognized a transitional impairment loss of $39.8 million for goodwill related to ELI (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ($ in thousands) 2002 Amount Revenue $ 4,650 Operating income (loss) $ (415) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,478) Gain on disposal of water segment net of tax $ 181,369 On January 15, 2002, we completed the sale of our water and wastewater operations for $859.1 million in cash and $122.5 million of assumed debt and other liabilities. The gain on the disposal of the water segment, net of tax, was $181.4 million. 33 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity and commodity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business or to hedge long term interest rate risk. Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio and interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. The long term debt and capital lease obligations include various instruments with various maturities and weighted average interest rates. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, a majority of our borrowings have fixed interest rates. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2004, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In order to manage our interest rate risk exposure, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, we make semi annual, floating interest rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the interest savings resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $9.4 million. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2004, the fair value of our long term debt and capital lease obligations was estimated to be approximately $4.6 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 7.83% and our overall weighted maturity of 13 years. There has been no material change in the weighted average maturity since December 31, 2003. The overall weighted average interest rate decreased in 2004 by approximately 26 basis points. A hypothetical increase of 78 basis points in our weighted average interest rate (10% of our overall weighted average borrowing rate) would result in an approximate $218.4 million decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in equity prices as of December 31, 2004 is limited to our investment in Adelphia, and our pension assets of $761.2 million. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we owned 3,059,000 shares of Adelphia common stock. The stock price of Adelphia was $0.39 and $0.55 at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. On August 13, 2004, we sold our entire 1,333,500 shares of D & E for approximately $13.3 million in cash. On September 3, 2004, we sold our entire holdings of 2,605,908 common share equivalents in HTCC for approximately $13.2 million in cash. Sensitivity analysis of equity price exposure At December 31, 2004, the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio was estimated to be $1.2 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in quoted market prices would result in an approximate $120,000 decrease in the fair value of the equity portion of our investment portfolio. 34 Disclosure of limitations of sensitivity analysis Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value. This analysis incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2004. It does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate exposure with respect to our market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and the fluctuation of interest rates and quoted market prices.
