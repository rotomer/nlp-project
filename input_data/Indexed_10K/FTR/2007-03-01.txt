Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "believes," "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, and our future results may be materially affected by, any of the following possibilities: * Our ability to complete the acquisition of Commonwealth, to successfully integrate their operations and to realize the synergies from the acquisition; * Our ability to refinance the bridge loan that will be used to finance any remaining cash portion of the merger consideration with long term debt; * Changes in the number of our revenue generating units, which consists of access lines plus high speed internet subscribers; * The effects of competition from wireless, other wireline carriers (through VOIP or otherwise), high speed cable modems and cable telephony; * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * The effects of general and local economic and employment conditions on our revenues; * Our ability to effectively manage service quality; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers; * Our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and subsidies; * Changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; * The effects of changes in regulation in the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, including potential changes in access charges and subsidy payments, and regulatory network upgrade and reliability requirements; * Our ability to comply with federal and state regulation (including state rate of return limitations on our earnings) and our ability to successfully renegotiate state regulatory plans as they expire or come up for renewal from time to time; * Our ability to manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to reduce or refinance our debt; * Adverse changes in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability and or increase the cost of financing; * The effects of bankruptcies in the telecommunications industry, which could result in potential bad debts; 20 * The effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; * The effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; * Changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and or federal or state tax assessments; * The effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; * Our ability to successfully renegotiate expiring union contracts covering approximately 1,526 employees that are scheduled to expire during 2007; * Our ability to pay a $1.00 per common share dividend annually may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes (which will increase in 2007) and our liquidity; * The effects of any future liabilities or compliance costs in connection with worker health and safety matters; * The effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; and * The effects of more general factors, including changes in economic, business and industry conditions. Any of the foregoing events, or other events, could cause financial information to vary from managements forward looking statements included in this report. You should consider these important factors, as well as the risks set forth under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" above, in evaluating any statement in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. Overview We are a full service communications provider and one of the largest exchange telephone carriers in the country. We offer our incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) services under the "Frontier" name. On July 31, 2006 we sold our competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI). We are accounting for ELI as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations. In September 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Commonwealth. This acquisition, if successfully completed, will expand our presence in Pennsylvania and strengthen our position as a market leading full service communications provider to rural markets. The acquisition is subject to approval by the Pennsylvania PUC. All other regulatory approvals have been received. Competition in the telecommunications industry is intense and increasing. We experience competition from many telecommunications service providers including cable operators, wireless carriers, voice over internet protocol (VOIP) providers, long distance providers, competitive local exchange carriers, internet providers and other wireline carriers. We believe that competition will continue to intensify in 2007 across all of our products and in all of our markets. Our Frontier business experienced erosion in access lines and switched access minutes in 2006 as a result of competition. Competition in our markets may result in reduced revenues in 2007. The communications industry is undergoing significant changes. The market is extremely competitive, resulting in lower prices. These trends are likely to continue and result in a challenging revenue environment. These factors could also result in more bankruptcies in the sector and therefore affect our ability to collect money owed to us by carriers. Revenues from data and internet services such as high speed internet continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from services such as local line and access charges and subsidies are decreasing as a percentage of our revenues. These factors, along with the potential for increasing operating costs, could cause our profitability and our cash generated by operations to decrease. 21 (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow from Operating Activities As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $1.04 billion. Our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations. Our cash balance increased significantly in December 2006 when we borrowed $550.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we used cash flow from continuing operations, proceeds from the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB), proceeds from the sale of ELI and cash and cash equivalents to fund capital expenditures, dividends, interest payments, debt repayments and stock repurchases. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and credit facilities will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt payments through 2007, pay taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy and support our short term and long term operating strategies. We have approximately $39.3 million and $497.7 million of debt maturing in 2007 and 2008, respectively. A number of factors, including but not limited to, losses of access lines, increases in competition and lower subsidy and access revenues are expected to reduce our cash generated by operations and may require us to increase capital expenditures. Our below investment grade credit ratings may make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt. We have in recent years paid relatively low amounts of cash taxes. We expect that in 2007 our cash taxes will increase substantially. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Commonwealth Acquisition On September 17, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Commonwealth for $41.72 per share, in a cash and stock taxable transaction, for a total consideration of $1.16 billion, based on the closing price of Citizens common stock on September 15, 2006. Each Commonwealth share will receive $31.31 in cash and 0.768 shares of Citizens common stock. The acquisition has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both Citizens and Commonwealth and by Commonwealths shareholders. The transaction has received the requisite Hart Scott Rodino and FCC approvals, but is still subject to Pennsylvania PUC regulatory approval. We expect the transaction to be consummated in the first half of 2007. We intend to finance the cash portion of the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and debt. We obtained a commitment letter for a $990.0 million senior unsecured term loan, the proceeds of which may be used to pay the cash portion of the acquisition consideration (including cash payable upon the assumed conversion of $300.0 million of the Commonwealth convertible notes in connection with the acquisition), to cash out restricted shares, options and other equity awards of Commonwealth, to repay all of Commonwealths outstanding indebtedness (which was $35.0 million as of December 31, 2006) and to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition. We expect to refinance this term loan, which matures within one year, with long tem debt prior to the maturity thereof. On December 22, 2006 this commitment was reduced by $400.0 million as the result of our issuance of 7.875% senior notes due 2027 in the amount of $400.0 million (see "Cash Flow from Financing Activities Issuance of Debt Securities" below). In December 2006, we also borrowed $150.0 million from CoBank under a 6 year unsecured term loan. These proceeds can be used to repurchase existing indebtedness or to essentially reduce the amount of additional borrowings needed in connection with the Commonwealth transaction. We expect the need to borrow $200.0 million $300.0 million under the remaining commitment to close the Commonwealth transaction, pay all closing transaction costs and implementation costs. Rural Telephone Bank Proceeds In August 2005, the Board of Directors of the RTB voted to dissolve the bank. In November 2005, the liquidation and dissolution of the RTB was initiated with the signing of the 2006 Agricultural Appropriation bill by President Bush. We received approximately $64.6 million in cash from the dissolution of the RTB in April 2006, which resulted in the recognition of a pre tax gain of approximately $61.4 million during the second quarter of 2006. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the cash distribution is expected to be approximately $2.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the federal and state level. 22 Sale of Non Core Operations and Investments During 2006, we sold ELI, our CLEC business (including its associated real estate), for $255.3 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. During 2005, we executed a strategy of divesting non core assets, which resulted in the following transactions: On February 1, 2005, we sold 20,672 shares of Prudential Financial, Inc. for approximately $1.1 million in cash. On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of Conference Call USA, LLC for $43.6 million. In June 2005, we sold for cash our interests in certain key man life insurance policies on the lives of Leonard Tow, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and his wife, a former director. The cash surrender value of the policies purchased by Dr. Tow totaled approximately $24.2 million, and we recognized a gain of approximately $457,000 that is included in investment and other income. During 2005, we sold 79,828 shares of Global Crossing Limited for $1.1 million in cash. Capital Expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2006, our capital expenditures were $268.8 million. We continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $270.0 million $280.0 million for 2007. Increasing competition and improving the capabilities or reducing the maintenance costs of our plant may cause our capital expenditures to increase in the future. Our capital expenditures planned for new services such as wireless and VOIP in 2007 are not material. However, based on the success of our planned roll out of these products that began in late 2006, our capital expenditures for these products may increase in the future. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Debt Reduction and Debt Exchanges For the year ended December 31, 2006, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $251.0 million of debt, including $15.9 million of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities (EPPICS) that were converted into our common stock. During the first quarter of 2006, we entered into two debt for debt exchanges of our debt securities. As a result, $47.5 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 were exchanged for approximately $47.4 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into four debt for debt exchanges and exchanged $157.3 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 for $149.9 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. The 9.00% notes are callable on the same general terms and conditions as the 7.625% notes exchanged. No cash was exchanged in these transactions. However, with respect to the first quarter debt exchanges, a non cash pre tax loss of approximately $2.4 million was recognized in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," which is included in other income (loss), net. On June 1, 2006, we retired at par our entire $175.0 million principal amount of 7.60% Debentures due June 1, 2006. On June 14, 2006, we repurchased $22.7 million of our 6.75% Senior Notes due August 17, 2006 at a price of 100.181% of par. On August 17, 2006, we retired at par the $29.1 million remaining balance of the 6.75% Senior Notes. In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our outstanding debt over the following twelve month period. Through December 31, 2006, we had not made any purchases pursuant to this authorization. 23 For the year ended December 31, 2005, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $36.4 million of debt, including $30.0 million of EPPICS that were converted into our common stock. During the second quarter of 2005, we entered into two debt for debt exchanges of our debt securities. As a result, $50.0 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 were exchanged for approximately $52.2 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. The 9.00% notes are callable on the same general terms and conditions as the 7.625% notes exchanged. No cash was exchanged in these transactions, however a non cash pre tax loss of approximately $3.2 million was recognized in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," which is included in other income (loss), net. During August and September 2004, we repurchased an additional $108.2 million of our 6.75% notes which, in addition to the $300.0 million we purchased in July, resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately $20.1 million during the third quarter of 2004, but resulted in an annual reduction in interest expense of about $27.6 million per year. See the discussion below concerning EPPICS conversions for further information regarding the issuance of common stock. We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market, through tender offers, exchanges of debt securities, by exercising rights to call or privately negotiated transactions. We may also exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations. Issuance of Debt Securities On December 22, 2006, we issued in a private placement, $400.0 million principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2027. Proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to partially finance our acquisition of Commonwealth or if the acquisition is not completed, to purchase, redeem or otherwise retire a portion of our outstanding debt. We have agreed to file with the SEC a registration statement for the purpose of exchanging these notes for registered notes. In December 2006, we borrowed $150.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan agreement. The loan matures in 2012 and bears interest based on an average prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR, at our election plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio. We intend to use the proceeds to repurchase a portion of our outstanding debt or to partially finance our acquisition of Commonwealth. EPPICS In 1996, our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust (the Trust), issued, in an underwritten public offering, 4,025,000 shares of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 (Trust Convertible Preferred Securities or EPPICS), representing preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust, with a liquidation preference of $50 per security (for a total liquidation amount of $201.3 million). These securities have an adjusted conversion price of $11.46 per share of our common stock. The conversion price was reduced from $13.30 to $11.46 during the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the $2.00 per share of common stock special, non recurring dividend. The proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase $207.5 million aggregate liquidation amount of 5% Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 from another wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Capital L.P. (the Partnership). The proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase from us $211.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2036. The sole assets of the Trust are the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities, and our Convertible Subordinated Debentures are substantially all the assets of the Partnership. Our obligations under the agreements relating to the issuances of such securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trusts obligations relating to the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and the Partnerships obligations relating to the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities. In accordance with the terms of the issuances, we paid the annual 5% interest in quarterly installments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Cash was paid (net of investment returns) to the Partnership in payment of the interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The cash was then distributed by the Partnership to the Trust and then by the Trust to the holders of the EPPICS. As of December 31, 2006, EPPICS representing a total principal amount of $193.9 million have been converted into 15.6 million shares of our common stock, and a total of $7.4 million remains outstanding to third parties. Our long term debt footnote indicates $17.9 million of EPPICS outstanding at December 31, 2006, of which $10.5 million is debt of related parties for which we have an offsetting receivable. 24 Interest Rate Management In order to manage our interest expense, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, we make semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. The underlying variable rate on these swaps is set either in advance or in arrears. The notional amounts of fixed rate indebtedness hedged as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 were $550.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. Such contracts require us to pay variable rates of interest (estimated average pay rates of approximately 9.02% as of December 31, 2006 and approximately 8.60% as of December 31, 2005) and receive fixed rates of interest (average receive rate of 8.26% as of December 31, 2006 and 8.46% as of December 31, 2005). All swaps are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 (as amended) as fair value hedges. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the interest expense resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $4.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004 our interest expense was reduced by $2.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively, as a result of our swaps. Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2006, we had an available line of credit with financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $249.6 million. Outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the facility were $0.4 million. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our debt leverage ratio, and are 0.375% per annum as of December 31, 2006. The expiration date for the facility is October 29, 2009. During the term of the facility we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facilities agreements include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with GAAP, restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract, rule or regulation. Our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC) contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.00 to 1. Our $250.0 million credit facility and our $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.50 to 1. Although both facilities are unsecured, they will be equally and ratably secured by certain liens and equally and ratably guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries if we issue debt that is secured or guaranteed. Certain indentures for our senior unsecured debt obligations limit our ability to create liens or merge or consolidate with other companies and our subsidiaries ability to borrow funds, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. We are in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities We receive proceeds from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock based compensation plans. For the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we received approximately $27.2 million and $47.6 million, respectively, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. On August 17, 2004, we issued 32,074,000 shares of common stock, including 3,591,000 treasury shares, to our equity unit holders in settlement of the equity purchase contract component of the equity units. With respect to the $460.0 million senior note component of the equity units, we repurchased $300.0 million principal amount of these notes in July 2004. The remaining $160.0 million of the senior notes were repriced and a portion was remarketed on August 12, 2004 as our 6.75% notes due August 17, 2006. 25 Share Repurchase Programs In February 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. This share repurchase program commenced on March 6, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased 10,199,900 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $135.2 million. No more shares can be repurchased under this authorization. On May 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock. This share repurchase program commenced on June 13, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we completed the repurchase program and had repurchased a total of 18,775,156 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $250.0 million. Dividends Our ongoing annual dividends of $1.00 per share of common stock under our current policy utilize a significant portion of our cash generated by operations and therefore could limit our operating and financial flexibility. While we believe that the amount of our dividends will allow for adequate amounts of cash flow for other purposes, any reduction in cash generated by operations and any increases in capital expenditures, interest expense or cash taxes would reduce the amount of cash generated in excess of dividends. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationship with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006 is as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payment due by period Less than More than ($ in thousands) Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt obligations, excluding interest (see Note 11) (1) $4,532,904 $39,271 $500,195 $1,258,403 $2,735,035 Operating lease obligations (see Note 25) 69,393 15,794 19,510 15,904 18,185 Purchase obligations (see Note 25) 70,165 26,449 35,509 7,547 660 Total $4,672,462 $81,514 $555,214 $1,281,854 $2,753,880 (1) Includes interest rate swaps (($10.3) million). At December 31, 2006, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $22.8 million. Management Succession and Strategic Alternatives Expenses On July 11, 2004, our Board of Directors announced that it completed its review of our financial and strategic alternatives. In 2004, we expensed $90.6 million of costs related to management succession and our exploration of financial and strategic alternatives. Included are $36.6 million of non cash expenses for the acceleration of stock benefits, cash expenses of $19.2 million for advisory fees, $19.3 million for severance and retention arrangements and $15.5 million primarily for tax reimbursements. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture for our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. We have sold all of these properties. All of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities (typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale), including environmental liabilities, for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement. 26 Discontinued Operations On July 31, 2006, we sold our CLEC business Electric Lightwave LLC (ELI) for $255.3 million (including a later sale of associated real estate) in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. We recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of ELI of approximately $116.7 million. Our after tax gain on the sale was $71.6 million. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the sale is expected to be approximately $5.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the federal and state level. On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of Conference Call USA, LLC (CCUSA) for $43.6 million in cash. The pre tax gain on the sale of CCUSA was $14.1 million. Our after tax gain was $1.2 million. The book income taxes recorded upon sale are primarily attributable to a low tax basis in the assets sold. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, employee benefit plans, income taxes, contingencies, and pension and postretirement benefits expenses among others. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. Telecommunications Bankruptcies Our estimate of anticipated losses related to telecommunications bankruptcies is a "critical accounting estimate." We have significant on going normal course business relationships with many telecom providers, some of which have filed for bankruptcy. We generally reserve approximately 95% of the net outstanding pre bankruptcy balances owed to us and believe that our estimate of the net realizable value of the amounts owed to us by bankrupt entities is appropriate. In 2006 and 2005, we had no "critical estimates" related to telecommunications bankruptcies. Asset Impairment In 2006 and 2005, we had no "critical estimates" related to asset impairments. Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. An independent study of the estimated useful lives of our plant assets was completed in 2005 and updated in 2006. We adopted the lives proposed in the study effective October 1, 2005 and as revised on October 1, 2006. Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, we aggregate our reporting units into one ILEC segment. In determining fair value of goodwill during 2006 we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ILEC properties as well as trading values of our publicly traded common stock. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill. An independent third party appraiser analyzed trade name. 27 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other post retirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are "critical accounting estimates." We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of current and former employees and other post retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance benefits and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The pension plan for the majority of our current employees is frozen. The accounting results for pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. The discount rate is used to value, on a present basis, our pension and post retirement benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and post retirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term, high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and Bloomberg Finance and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. Our discount rate increased from 5.625% at year end 2005 to 6.00% at year end 2006. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and post retirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year and 10 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 35% to 55% in fixed income securities, 35% to 55% in equity securities and 5% to 15% in alternative investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. In 2006, we did not change our expected long term rate of return from the 8.25% used in 2005. Our pension plan assets are valued at actual market value as of the measurement date. Accounting standards in effect prior to December 31, 2006 required that we record an additional minimum pension liability when the plans "accumulated benefit obligation" exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement (balance sheet) date. In the fourth quarter of 2004, mainly due to a decrease in the year end discount rate, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability in the amount of $17.4 million with a corresponding charge to shareholders equity of $10.7 million, net of taxes of $6.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily due to another decrease in the year end discount rate, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability in the amount of $36.4 million with a corresponding charge to shareholders equity of $22.5 million, net of taxes of $13.9 million. These adjustments did not impact our net income or cash flows. We expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for 2007 will be $11.0 million to $14.0 million (they were $11.3 million in 2006) and that no contribution will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2007. No contribution was made to our pension plan during 2006. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates in 2005 and 2004 were below statutory rate levels (2006 was close to statutory) as a result of the completion of audits with federal and state taxing authorities and changes in the structure of certain of our subsidiaries. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In October 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," which completes the first phase of a FASB project that will comprehensively reconsider accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans and amends the following FASB Statements: * SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions;" 28 * SFAS No. 88, "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits;" * SFAS No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions;" and * SFAS No. 132(R), "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." SFAS No. 158 requires (1) recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet, (2) recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost, (3) measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date, and (4) disclosure of additional information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period. In addition, SFAS No. 158 amends SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 to include guidance regarding selection of assumed discount rates for use in measuring the benefit obligation. For public companies, the requirements to recognize the funded status of a plan and to comply with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective as of the end of the fiscal year that ends after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position at December 31, 2006. See Note 24. Consideration of Prior Years Errors in Quantifying Current Year Misstatements In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, "Consideration of Prior Years Errors in Quantifying Current Year Misstatements." SAB No. 108 provides guidance concerning the process to be applied in considering the impact of prior years errors in quantifying misstatements in the current year. SAB No. 108 is effective for periods ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB No. 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006. See Note 5. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes." Among other things, FIN No. 48 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of FIN No. 48 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement In June 2006, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 06 3, "How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement" (EITF No. 06 3), which requires disclosure of the accounting policy for any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction, that is Gross versus Net presentation. EITF No. 06 3 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt the disclosure requirements of EITF No. 06 3 commencing January 1, 2007. Exchanges of Productive Assets In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets," an amendment of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of certain non monetary assets (except for certain exchanges of products or property held for sale in the ordinary course of business). The Statement requires that non monetary exchanges be accounted for at the fair value of the assets exchanged, with gains or losses being recognized, if the fair value is determinable within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We have not had any "exchanges of nonmonetary" assets. Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," an interpretation of FASB No. 143. FIN No. 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB No. 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. Although a liability exists for the removal of asbestos, sufficient information is not available currently to estimate the amount of our liability, as the range of time over which we may settle theses obligations is unknown or cannot be reasonably estimated. The adoption of FIN No. 47 during the fourth quarter of 2005 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. 29 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions, unless it is impracticable to do so. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 during the first quarter of 2006 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. Partnerships In June 2005, the FASB issued EITF No. 04 5, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights," which provides new guidance on how general partners in a limited partnership should determine whether they control a limited partnership. EITF No. 04 5 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We are the managing partner and have a 33% ownership position in a wireless voice business, Mohave Cellular Limited Partnership (Mohave). The Company has applied the provisions of EITF No. 04 5 retrospectively and consolidated Mohave for all periods presented. Stock Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R requires that stock based employee compensation be recorded as a charge to earnings. In April 2005, the SEC required adoption of SFAS No. 123R for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we have adopted SFAS No. 123R commencing January 1, 2006 using a modified prospective application, as permitted by SFAS No. 123R. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Under this application, we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we applied APB No. 25 and related interpretations to account for our stock plans resulting in the use of the intrinsic value to value the stock. Under APB No. 25, we were not required to recognize compensation expense for the cost of stock options. In accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recorded stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted shares and stock units issued under our stock plans (together, Stock Based Awards). Stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $10.3 million ($6.7 million after tax or $0.02 per basic and diluted share of common stock). Accounting for Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements In September 2006, the FASB reached consensus on the guidance provided by EITF No. 06 4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. The guidance is applicable to endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements, whereby the employer owns and controls the insurance policy, that are associated with a postretirement benefit. EITF No. 06 4 requires that for a split dollar life insurance arrangement within the scope of the issue, an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with FAS No. 106 (if, in substance, a postretirement benefit plan exists) or Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 12 (if the arrangement is, in substance, an individual deferred compensation contract) based on the substantive agreement with the employee. EITF No. 06 4 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Companys results of operations or financial condition. Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance In September 2006, the FASB reached consensus on the guidance provided by EITF No. 06 5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance. EITF No. 06 5 states that a policyholder should consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the insurance policy other than the cash surrender value in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract. EITF No. 06 5 also states that a policyholder should determine the amount that could be realized under the life insurance contract assuming the surrender of an individual life by individual life policy (or certificate by certificate in a 30 group policy). EITF No. 06 5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Companys results of operations or financial condition. 31 (b) Results of Operations REVENUE Revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance and data services. Such services are provided under either a monthly recurring fee or based on usage at a tariffed rate and is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. Consolidated revenue increased $8.3 million, from $2.017 billion in 2005 to $2.025 billion in 2006. Consolidated revenue decreased $5.3 million in 2005. The decrease in 2005 is primarily due to the sale in 2004 of our electric utility property, partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in telecommunications revenue. Our electric utility contributed $9.7 million of revenue in 2004. In July 2006, we sold our CLEC segment (ELI) to Integra. As a result, we have reclassified ELIs results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and restated prior periods. In June 2005, the FASB issued EITF No. 04 5, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights," which provides new guidance on how general partners in a limited partnership should determine whether they control a limited partnership. The Company has applied the provisions of EITF No. 04 5 retrospectively and consolidated Mohave for all periods presented. On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of our conferencing service business, CCUSA. As a result of the sale, we have classified CCUSAs results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations and restated prior periods. Change in the number of our access lines is important to our revenue and profitability. We have lost access lines primarily because of competition, changing consumer behavior, economic conditions, changing technology, and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add high speed internet or cable modem service. We lost approximately 111,000 access lines during 2006, but added approximately 75,100 high speed internet subscribers during this same period. We lost 98,800 residential customer lines and 12,200 non residential customer lines in 2006. The non residential line losses were principally in Rochester, New York, while the residential losses were throughout our markets. We expect to continue to lose access lines but to increase high speed internet subscribers during 2007. A continued loss of access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed in MD&A, may cause our revenues, profitability and cash flows to decrease in 2007. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REVENUE ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Local services $ 809,584 $ (20,101) 2% $ 829,685 $ (21,392) 3% $ 851,077 Access services 427,959 (3,380) 1% 431,339 (25,589) 6% 456,928 Long distance services 153,272 (16,224) 10% 169,496 (14,127) 8% 183,623 Data and internet services 424,209 58,596 16% 365,613 51,835 17% 313,778 Directory services 114,138 1,046 1% 113,092 2,469 2% 110,623 Other 96,205 (11,611) 11% 107,816 11,202 12% 96,614 ILEC revenue $2,025,367 $ 8,326 0% $2,017,041 $ 4,398 0% $2,012,643 Local Services Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $20.1 million or 2%, as compared with the prior year. Local revenue decreased $25.9 million primarily due to continued losses of access lines partially offset by a local rate increase on some of our Rochester residential access lines effective August 2006. 2005 reflected a reserve of $4.0 million associated with a state rate of return limitation on earnings. Enhanced services revenue increased $5.8 million, primarily due to sales of additional feature packages. Economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our packages and bundles and cause us to lower our prices for those products and services, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability and cash flow. 32 Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $21.4 million or 3%, as compared with the prior year. This decline is comprised of $18.8 million related to the continued loss of access lines and $4.0 million related to a reserve associated with state rate of return limitations on earnings. Enhanced services revenue increased $5.9 million, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to sales of additional product packages. Access Services Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $3.4 million or 1%, as compared with the prior year. Access services includes both switched revenue and subsidy payments. Switched access revenue decreased $13.9 million to $263.4 million. Approximately $24.0 million of the switched access decline was attributable to a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses. This decline was offset by approximately $9.3 million of disputed carrier activity resolved in the Companys favor during the fourth quarter of 2006. Subsidies revenue increased $10.5 million to $164.6 million primarily due to increased receipts from the federal high cost fund due to higher costs in the base year, as well as increased receipts from state high cost funds. Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $25.6 million or 6%, as compared with the prior year. Switched access revenue decreased $9.7 million, as compared with the prior year period, primarily due to a decline in minutes of use. Access service revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies. Subsidy revenue decreased $15.9 million primarily due to decreased Universal Service Fund (USF) support of $19.2 million because of increases in the national average cost per loop (NACPL) and a decrease of $2.0 million related to changes in measured factors, partially offset by an increase of $6.4 million in USF surcharge rates. Increases in the number of Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Companies (including wireless companies) receiving federal subsidies, among other factors, may lead to further increases in the NACPL, thereby resulting in decreases in our subsidy revenue in the future. The FCC and state regulators are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies. The FCC is also reviewing the mechanism by which subsidies are funded. Additionally, the FCC has an open proceeding to address reform to access charges and other intercarrier compensation. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided nor the effect on our subsidy or access revenues. Future reductions in our subsidy and access revenues are not expected to be accompanied by proportional decreases in our costs, so any further reductions in those revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows. We currently expect that as a result of an increase in the national average cost per loop, a decrease in our cost structure and the elimination of high speed internet from the calculation of the FCCs USF surcharge (which has a corresponding decrease in operating expenses) there is likely to be a decrease in the total subsidy revenue earned in 2007 and such decrease may be significant in relation to the total amount of our subsidy revenue. Long Distance Services Long distance services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 decreased $16.2 million or 10% in 2006 and $14.1 million or 8% in 2005, primarily due to a decline in the average rate per minute. Our long distance minutes of use increased during 2006. We have actively marketed bundles or unlimited use of long distance minutes particularly with our packages of multiple services. The sale of bundled and unlimited minutes has resulted in an increase in minutes used by our long distance customers and has had the effect of lowering our overall average rate per minute billed. Our long distance revenues may continue to decrease in the future due to lower rates and or minutes of use. Competing services such as wireless, VOIP and cable telephony are resulting in a loss of customers, minutes of use and further declines in the rates we charge our customers. We expect these factors will continue to adversely affect our long distance revenues during 2007. Data and Internet Services Data and internet services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 increased $58.6 million, or 16%, and $51.8 million, or 17%, respectively, as compared with the prior year primarily due to growth in data and high speed internet services. The number of the Companys high speed internet subscribers has increased by more than 75,000 or 24% since December 31, 2005. Data & Internet services also includes revenue from data transmission services to other carriers and high volume commercial customers with dedicated high capacity circuits like DS 1s and DS 3s. Revenue from these dedicated high capacity circuits increased $9.1 million in 2006 and $15.0 million in 2005, primarily due to growth in those circuits. 33 Directory Services Directory revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 increased $1.0 million, or 1%, and $2.5 million, or 2%, respectively, as compared with the prior year due to growth in yellow pages advertising. Other Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $11.6 million or 11%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $7.5 million and decreases of $2.3 million for promotional credits, $1.8 million in sales of customer premise equipment (CPE) and $1.6 million in "bill and collect" fee revenue. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.5 million for cellular roaming revenue of the Mohave Cellular Limited Partnership. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $11.2 million, or 12%, compared with the prior year primarily due to a $4.8 million decrease in bad debt expense, a $4.1 million increase in cellular revenue and a $1.8 million increase related to sales of television service. ELECTRIC REVENUE We sold our Vermont electric division on April 1, 2004. Electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $9.7 million. We have sold all of our electric operations and as a result will have no operating results in future periods for these businesses. COST OF SERVICES ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Network access $ 171,247 $ 14,425 9% $ 156,822 $ 1,431 1% $ 155,391 Electric energy and fuel oil purchased (5,523) 100% 5,523 $ 171,247 $ 14,425 9% $ 156,822 $ (4,092) 3% $ 160,914 Network access Network access expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 increased $14.4 million and $1.4 million, or 9%, and 1%, respectively, as compared with the prior year period. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we expensed $9.7 million of promotional costs associated with a fourth quarter high speed internet promotion that subsidized the cost of a new personal computer for the customer in return for a multi year contract. The remaining increases in network costs for 2006 and 2005 are primarily due to increasing rates and usage. As we continue to increase our sales of data products such as high speed internet and expand the availability of our unlimited long distance calling plans, our network access expense is likely to increase. Access line losses have offset some of the increase. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased We sold our Vermont electric division on April 1, 2004. Electric energy and fuel oil purchased for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $5.5 million. We have sold all of our electric operations and as a result will have no operating results in future periods for these businesses. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Operating expenses $551,620 $ (21,505) 4% $ 573,125 $ (11,586) 2% $ 584,711 Taxes other than income taxes 86,568 (5,219) 6% 91,787 181 0% 91,606 Sales and marketing 94,955 8,820 10% 86,135 1,302 2% 84,833 $733,143 $ (17,904) 2% $ 751,047 $ (10,103) 1% $ 761,150 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $21.5 million, or 4%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to headcount reductions and associated decreases in salaries and benefits and improved expense control in benefit costs. 34 Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $11.6 million, or 2%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to lower billing expenses as a result of the conversion of one of our billing systems in 2004 partially offset by rate increases for federal USF mandated contributions and annual fees to regulatory agencies. We routinely review our operations, personnel and facilities to achieve greater efficiencies. We are in the process of consolidating our call center operations. As we work through the consolidation, including the opening of a new call center in Deland, FL in August 2006, and the closing of call centers in 2007, we expect that our operating expenses will temporarily increase. As noted elsewhere, the introduction of new service offerings may also negatively impact our cost structure. Included in operating expenses is stock compensation expense. Stock compensation expense was $10.3 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we began expensing the cost of the unvested portion of outstanding stock options pursuant to SFAS No. 123R. Included in operating expenses is pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses which was $11.3 million in 2006 will be approximately $11.0 million to $14.0 million in 2007 and that no contribution will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2007. No contribution was made to our pension plan during 2006. In future periods, if the value of our pension assets decline and or projected benefit costs increase, we may have increased pension expenses. Taxes Other than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $5.2 million, or 6%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to refunds received and changes in revenue subject to gross receipts taxes. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $8.8 million, or 10%, as compared with the prior year and increased $1.3 million, or 2% for the year ended 2005 as compared to 2004. Sales and marketing expenses are increasing due to a competitive environment and the launch of new products. As our markets become more competitive and we launch new products, we expect that our marketing costs may increase. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Depreciation expense $ 350,107 $ (43,719) 11% $ 393,826 $ (29,035) 7% $ 422,861 Amortization expense 126,380 2 0% 126,378 (142) 0% 126,520 $ 476,487 $ (43,717) 8% $ 520,204 $ (29,177) 5% $ 549,381 Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 decreased $43.7 million, or 11%, and $29.0 million, or 7%, respectively, as compared with the prior years due to a declining net asset base and changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. Effective with the completion of an independent study of the estimated useful lives of our plant assets we adopted new lives beginning October 1, 2005. The study concluded that remaining life estimates should be increased for copper facilities and decreased for switching assets (among other less minor changes). This study was updated as of September 30, 2006. Based on the study and our planned capital expenditures, we expect that our depreciation expense will continue to decline in 2007 by approximately 5% as compared to 2006. MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES EXPENSES On July 11, 2004, our Board of Directors announced that it completed its review of our financial and strategic alternatives. In 2004, we expensed $90.6 million of costs related to management succession and our exploration of financial and strategic alternatives. Included are $36.6 million of non cash expenses for the acceleration of stock benefits, cash expenses of $19.2 million for advisory fees, $19.3 million for severance and retention arrangements and $15.5 million primarily for tax reimbursements. 35 INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME (LOSS), NET / INTEREST EXPENSE / INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Amount $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Investment income $ 83,570 $ 69,230 483% $ 14,340 $ (18,426) 56% $ 32,766 Other income (loss), net $ (1,127) $ 234 17% $ (1,361) $ 52,104 97% $(53,465) Interest expense $336,446 $ (2,289) 1% $338,735 $ (39,556) 10% $378,291 Income tax expense $136,479 $ 61,209 81% $ 75,270 $ 71,023 1672% $ 4,247 Investment Income Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $69.2 million as compared with the prior year primarily due to higher cash balances during the year arising from the $65.0 million of cash received from the liquidation and dissolution of the RTB (and gain recognized of $61.4 million), the $255.3 million in cash received from the sale of ELI and the postponement of our stock repurchase and debt repurchase programs during the second half of 2006 in connection with our acquisition of Commonwealth. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $18.4 million, or 56%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the sale in 2004 of our investments in D & E Communications, Inc. (D & E) and Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corp. (HTCC), partially offset by higher income in 2005 from short term investments. Other Income (Loss), net Other income (loss), net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $0.2 million as compared to the prior year. Other income (loss) in 2006 consists primarily of the $4.2 million minority share of income in the Mohave Limited Partnership, insurance proceeds of $4.2 million, a loss of $2.4 million on the exchange of debt and gains recognized on the extinguishment of approximately $3.5 million of retained liabilities of our disposed water properties. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $52.1 million, or 97%, as compared to prior year. The increase is primarily due to a pre tax loss from the early extinguishment of debt of $66.5 million in 2004 and a net loss on sales of assets of $1.9 million, which is primarily attributable to the loss on the sale of our corporate aircraft, partially offset by $25.3 million in income from the expiration of certain retained liabilities at less than face value, which are associated with customer advances for construction from our disposed water properties. In addition, during 2005 $7.0 million was reserved in the fourth quarter in connection with a lawsuit, and during the second quarter we incurred a $3.2 million loss on the exchange of debt, partially offset by gains on our forward rate agreements. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $2.3 million, or 1%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to lower average debt levels partially offset by higher short term interest rates that we pay on our swap agreements ($550.0 million in principal amount is swapped to floating rate at December 31, 2006). Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared with the prior year was 18 basis points higher, increasing from 7.94% to 8.12%. With the expected acquisition of Commonwealth and the related incurrence of indebtness we expect our interest expense to increase in 2007. In December we borrowed $400.0 million in advance of the acquisition and another $150.0 million to be used for debt retirements. We expect the need to borrow another $200.0 $300.0 million to close the Commonwealth transaction, pay all closing transaction costs and implementation costs. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $39.6 million, or 10%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to the retirement and refinancing of debt. Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with the prior year was 2 basis points lower, decreasing from 7.96% to 7.94%. Income Taxes Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $61.2 million, or 81%, as compared with the prior year primarily due to changes in taxable income. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 35% as compared with an effective tax rate of 29% for 2005. We expect to utilize a substantial amount of tax net operating losses as a result of the sale of ELI and receipt of the RTB proceeds. We expect that in 2007 our cash paid for income taxes will increase significantly. 36 Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $71.0 million, as compared with the prior year primarily due to changes in taxable income and the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2005 was 28.6% as compared with 6.9% for 2004. Our effective tax rate was below statutory rates in both years as a result of the completion of audits with federal and state taxing authorities and changes in the structure of certain of our subsidiaries. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Amount Amount Amount Revenue $ 100,612 $ 163,768 $180,588 Operating income $ 27,882 $ 22,969 $ 24,809 Income taxes $ 11,583 $ 9,519 $ 9,132 Net income $ 18,912 $ 13,266 $ 15,086 Gain on disposal of ELI and CCUSA, net of tax $ 71,635 $ 1,167 $ On July 31, 2006, we sold our CLEC business, Electric Lightwave LLC (ELI) for $255.3 million (including the sale of associated real estate) in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. We recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of ELI of approximately $116.7 million. Our after tax gain on the sale was $71.6 million. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the sale is expected to be approximately $5.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the federal and state level. On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of CCUSA for $43.6 million in cash. The pre tax gain on the sale of CCUSA was $14.1 million. Our after tax gain was $1.2 million. The book income taxes recorded upon sale are primarily attributable to a low tax basis in the assets sold. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity and commodity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business or to hedge long term interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio and interest on our long term debt. The long term debt includes various instruments with various maturities and weighted average interest rates. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, all but $150.0 million of our borrowings have fixed interest rates. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2006, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In order to manage our interest expense, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, which qualify for hedge accounting, we make semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and receive a fixed rate on the notional amount. The underlying variable rate for these interest rate swaps is set in arrears. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net cash interest payment or (savings) resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $4.2 million and $(2.5) million, respectively. 37 Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately $4.6 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 8.19% and our overall weighted maturity of 13 years. There has been no material change in the weighted average maturity since December 31, 2005. The overall weighted average interest rate on our long term debt increased in 2006 by approximately 11 basis points. A hypothetical increase of 82 basis points in our weighted average interest rate (10% of our overall weighted average borrowing rate) would result in an approximate $238.0 million decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations or an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately $5.75 million. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in equity prices as of December 31, 2006 is limited to our pension assets of $770.2 million. We have no other equity investments of any material amount.
