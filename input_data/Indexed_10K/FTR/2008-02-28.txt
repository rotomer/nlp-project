Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, and our future results may be materially affected by, any of the following possibilities: * Reductions in the number of our access lines and high speed internet subscribers; * The effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise); * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * The effects of general and local economic, business, industry and employment conditions on our revenues; * Our ability to effectively manage service quality; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers; * Our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and subsidies; * Changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; * The effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, including potential changes in state rate of return limitations on our earnings, access charges and subsidy payments, and regulatory network upgrade and reliability requirements; * Our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to reduce or refinance our debt; * Adverse changes in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability and or increase the cost of financing; * The effects of bankruptcies in the telecommunications industry, which could result in potential bad debts; * The effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; * The effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; * Changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and or federal or state tax assessments; * The effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; 19 * Our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2008 and thereafter; * Our ability to pay a $1.00 per common share dividend annually, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes (which will increase in the future) and our liquidity; * The effects of fully utilizing our federal net operating loss carryforwards and AMT tax credit carryforwards that were generated in prior years, which have significantly increased our cash taxes in 2007 and will continue to do so in 2008 and 2009; * The effects of any future liabilities or compliance costs in connection with worker health and safety matters; and * The effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes. Any of the foregoing events, or other events, could cause financial information to vary from managements forward looking statements included in this report. You should consider these important factors, as well as the risks set forth under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" above, in evaluating any statement in this Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. Overview We are a full service communications provider and one of the largest exchange telephone carriers in the country. We offer our incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) services under the "Frontier" name. On July 31, 2006, we sold our competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI). We accounted for ELI as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations. On March 8, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, Inc., which includes a small CLEC component. This acquisition expands our presence in Pennsylvania and strengthens our position as a leading full service communications provider to rural markets. On October 31, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Global Valley Networks, Inc. and GVN Services which expands our presence in California and also strengthens our rural position. As of December 31, 2007, we operated in 24 states with approximately 5,900 employees. Competition in the telecommunications industry is intense and increasing. We experience competition from many telecommunications service providers, including cable operators, wireless carriers, voice over internet protocol (VOIP) providers, long distance providers, competitive local exchange carriers, internet providers and other wireline carriers. We believe that as of December 31, 2007, approximately 58% of the households in our territories are able to be served by alternate phone providers. We also believe that competition will continue to intensify in 2008 across all of our products and in all of our markets. Our Frontier business experienced erosion in access lines and switched access minutes in 2006 and 2007, primarily as a result of competition. Competition in our markets may result in reduced revenues in 2008. The communications industry is undergoing significant changes. The market is extremely competitive, resulting in lower prices. These trends are likely to continue and result in a challenging revenue environment. These factors could also result in more bankruptcies in the sector and, therefore, affect our ability to collect money owed to us by carriers. Revenues from data and internet services such as high speed internet continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from services such as local line and access charges (including Federal and state subsidies) are decreasing as a percentage of our revenues. These factors, along with the potential for increasing operating costs, could cause our profitability and our cash generated by operations to decrease. On October 24, 2007, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released an order granting us relief from certain tariff and pricing regulations on our existing packet switched and optical transmission services. While this is a positive regulatory step by the FCC, these services are a small, but growing, portion of our current total revenues. The impact of this ruling will not have an immediate material impact on our revenues. 20 (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow from Operating Activities As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $226.5 million. Our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we used cash flow from continuing operations, incremental borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents to fund a significant portion of the acquisition of Commonwealth, the entire acquisition of GVN, capital expenditures, dividends, interest payments, debt repayments and stock repurchases. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt payments through 2008, pay taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy and support our short term and long term operating strategies. However, a number of factors, including but not limited to, increased cash taxes, losses of access lines, increases in competition and lower subsidy and access revenues are expected to reduce our cash generated by operations. Our below investment grade credit ratings may make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt, although we do not have any significant maturities until 2011. We have approximately $2.4 million and $2.5 million of debt maturing in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We have in recent years paid relatively low amounts of cash taxes. We expect that in 2008 and beyond our cash taxes will increase substantially, as our federal net operating loss carryforwards and AMT tax credit carryforwards are estimated to be fully utilized during 2007 and 2008. We paid $54.4 million in cash taxes during 2007, and expect to pay approximately $130.0 million to $140.0 million in 2008. Our 2008 cash tax estimate does not reflect the impact of the "Economic Stimulus Act of 2008," which we are currently evaluating. Cash Flow used by Investing Activities Acquisitions On March 8, 2007, we acquired Commonwealth in a cash and stock taxable transaction, for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. We paid $804.1 million in cash ($663.7 million net, after cash acquired) and issued common stock with a value of approximately $247.4 million. In connection with the acquisition of Commonwealth, we assumed $35.0 million of debt under a revolving credit facility and $191.8 million face amount of Commonwealth convertible notes (fair value of $209.6 million). During March 2007, we paid down the $35.0 million credit facility. We have retired all but $8.5 million of the $191.8 million face amount of Commonwealth notes as of December 31, 2007. The notes were retired by the payment of $165.4 million in cash and the issuance of our common stock valued at approximately $36.7 million. The premium paid of $18.9 million was recorded as $17.8 million to goodwill and $1.1 million to other income (loss), net. On October 31, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Global Valley Networks, Inc. and GVN Services for a total cash consideration of $62.0 million. Rural Telephone Bank We received approximately $64.6 million in cash from the dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) in April 2006, which resulted in the recognition of a pre tax gain of approximately $61.4 million during the second quarter of 2006, as reflected in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our tax net operating losses were used to absorb the cash liability for taxes. Sale of Non Core Operations and Investments During 2006, we sold ELI, our CLEC business (including its associated real estate), for $255.3 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. During 2005, we executed a strategy of divesting non core assets, which resulted in the following transactions: On February 1, 2005, we sold 20,672 shares of Prudential Financial, Inc. for approximately $1.1 million. 21 On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of Conference Call USA, LLC for $43.6 million. In June 2005, we sold for cash our interests in certain key man life insurance policies on the lives of Leonard Tow, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and his wife, a former director. The cash surrender value of the policies purchased by Dr. Tow totaled approximately $24.2 million, and we recognized a gain of approximately $457,000 that is included in other income (loss), net. During 2005, we sold 79,828 shares of Global Crossing Limited for $1.1 million. Capital Expenditures For the year ended December 31, 2007, our capital expenditures were $315.8 million, including $34.3 million related to the Commonwealth and GVN properties since date of acquisition. We continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $300.0 million to $310.0 million for 2008. Cash Flow used by Financing Activities Debt Reduction and Debt Exchanges For the year ended December 31, 2007, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $967.2 million of debt, including $3.3 million of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities (EPPICS), and $17.8 million of 3.25% Commonwealth convertible notes that were converted into our common stock. On April 26, 2007, we redeemed $495.2 million principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2008 at a price of 103.041% plus accrued and unpaid interest. During the first quarter of 2007, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $200.0 million utilized to temporarily fund the acquisition of Commonwealth, and we paid down the $35.0 million Commonwealth credit facility. Through December 31, 2007, we retired $183.3 million face amount of Commonwealth convertible notes for which we paid $165.4 million in cash and $36.7 million in common stock (premium paid of $18.9 million was recorded as $17.8 million to goodwill and $1.1 million to other income (loss), net), resulting in a remaining outstanding balance of $8.5 million as of December 31, 2007. We also paid down $44.6 million of industrial development revenue bonds and $4.3 million of rural utilities service loan contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $251.0 million of debt, including $15.9 million of EPPICS that were converted into our common stock. During the first quarter of 2006, we entered into two debt for debt exchanges of our debt securities. As a result, $47.5 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 were exchanged for approximately $47.4 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into four debt for debt exchanges and exchanged $157.3 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 for $149.9 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. The 9.00% notes are callable on the same general terms and conditions as the 7.625% notes exchanged. No cash was exchanged in these transactions. However, with respect to the first quarter debt exchanges, a non cash pre tax loss of approximately $2.4 million was recognized in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," which is included in other income (loss), net. On June 1, 2006, we retired at par our entire $175.0 million principal amount of 7.60% Debentures due June 1, 2006. On June 14, 2006, we repurchased $22.7 million of our 6.75% Senior Notes due August 17, 2006 at a price of 100.181% of par. On August 17, 2006, we retired at par the $29.1 million remaining balance of the 6.75% Senior Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $36.4 million of debt, including $30.0 million of EPPICS that were converted into our common stock. During the second quarter of 2005, we entered into two debt for debt exchanges of our debt securities. As a result, $50.0 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 were exchanged for approximately $52.2 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. The 9.00% notes are callable on the same general terms and conditions as the 7.625% notes exchanged. No cash was exchanged in these transactions, however a non cash pre tax loss of approximately $3.2 million was recognized in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," which is included in other income (loss), net. We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market, through tender offers, exchanges of debt securities, by exercising rights to call or in privately negotiated transactions. We may also exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations. 22 Issuance of Debt Securities On March 23, 2007, we issued in a private placement an aggregate $300.0 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and $450.0 million principal amount of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2019. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down $200.0 million principal amount of indebtedness incurred on March 8, 2007 under a bridge loan facility in connection with the acquisition of Commonwealth and redeem, on April 26, 2007, $495.2 million principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2008. In the second quarter of 2007, we completed an exchange offer (to publicly register the debt) on the $750.0 million in total of private placement notes described above, in addition to the $400.0 million principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes issued in a private placement on December 22, 2006, for registered notes. On December 22, 2006, we issued in a private placement, $400.0 million principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2027. Proceeds from the sale were used to partially finance our acquisition of Commonwealth. In December 2006, we borrowed $150.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan agreement. The loan matures in 2012 and bears interest based on an average prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, at our election plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio. We used the proceeds to partially finance our acquisition of Commonwealth. EPPICS As of December 31, 2007, we have only $4.0 million of EPPICS related debt outstanding to third parties. The following disclosure provides the history regarding this issuance. In 1996, our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust (the Trust), issued, in an underwritten public offering, 4,025,000 shares of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 (Trust Convertible Preferred Securities or EPPICS), representing preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust, with a liquidation preference of $50 per security (for a total liquidation amount of $201.3 million). These securities have an adjusted conversion price of $11.46 per share of our common stock. The conversion price was reduced from $13.30 to $11.46 during the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the $2.00 per share of common stock special, non recurring dividend. The proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase $207.5 million aggregate liquidation amount of 5% Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 from another wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Capital L.P. (the Partnership). The proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase from us $211.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2036. The sole assets of the Trust are the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities, and our Convertible Subordinated Debentures are substantially all the assets of the Partnership. Our obligations under the agreements relating to the issuances of such securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trusts obligations relating to the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and the Partnerships obligations relating to the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities. In accordance with the terms of the issuances, we paid the annual 5% interest in quarterly installments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Cash was paid (net of investment returns) to the Partnership in payment of the interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The cash was then distributed by the Partnership to the Trust and then by the Trust to the holders of the EPPICS. As of December 31, 2007, EPPICS representing a total principal amount of $197.3 million had been converted into 15,918,182 shares of our common stock, and a total of $4.0 million remains outstanding to third parties. Our long term debt footnote indicates $14.5 million of EPPICS outstanding at December 31, 2007, of which $10.5 million is debt of related parties for which we have an offsetting receivable. Interest Rate Management In order to manage our interest expense, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, we made semi annual, floating rate interest payments based on six month LIBOR and received a fixed rate on the notional amount. The underlying variable rate on these swaps was set either in advance or in arrears. The notional amounts of fixed rate indebtedness hedged as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $400.0 million and $550.0 million, respectively. Such contracts required us to pay variable rates of interest (estimated average pay rates of approximately 8.54% as of December 31, 2007, and approximately 9.02% as of December 31, 2006) and receive fixed rates of interest (average receive rate of 8.50% as of December 31, 2007, and 8.26% as of December 31, 2006). All swaps are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 (as amended) as fair value hedges. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the interest expense resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $2.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our interest expense was reduced by $2.5 million, as a result of our swaps. 23 On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our Senior Notes due in 2011 and 2013. Cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million were received in January 2008. The related gain will be deferred on the balance sheet, and amortized into income over the term of the associated debt. Credit Facility As of December 31, 2007, we had available lines of credit with financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $250.0 million and there were no outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the facility. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our debt leverage ratio, and were 0.225% per annum as of December 31, 2007. The expiration date for this $250.0 million five year revolving credit agreement is May 18, 2012. During the term of the credit facility we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facility agreements include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract, rule or regulation, other than those imposed by the Delaware General Corporate laws. Our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC) contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.00 to 1. Our $250.0 million credit facility and our $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.50 to 1. Although both facilities are unsecured, they will be equally and ratably secured by certain liens and equally and ratably guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries if we issue debt that is secured or guaranteed. Certain indentures for our senior unsecured debt obligations limit our ability to create liens or merge or consolidate with other companies and our subsidiaries ability to borrow funds, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. We are in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities We receive proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of options pursuant to our stock based compensation plans. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we received approximately $13.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. Share Repurchase Programs In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. In February 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. This share repurchase program commenced on March 19, 2007, and was completed on October 15, 2007. During 2007, we repurchased 17,279,600 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $250.0 million. In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. This share repurchase program commenced on March 6, 2006. During 2006, we repurchased 10,199,900 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $135.2 million. No further purchases were made prior to expiration of this authorization. 24 On May 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock. This share repurchase program commenced on June 13, 2005. During 2005, we completed the repurchase program and had repurchased a total of 18,775,200 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $250.0 million. Dividends We expect to pay regular quarterly dividends. Our ability to fund a regular quarterly dividend will be impacted by our ability to generate cash from operations. The declarations and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007 is as follows: Contractual Obligations: Payment due by period ($ in thousands) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long term debt obligations, excluding interest (see Note 11) (1) $4,760,639 $ 2,448 $ 8,393 $1,431,534 $3,318,264 Interest on long term debt 4,887,086 370,721 740,879 579,081 3,196,405 Operating lease obligations (see Note 24) 79,052 24,094 23,399 16,025 15,534 Purchase obligations (see Note 24) 55,904 27,813 27,236 360 495 FIN No. 48 liability (see Note 2) 65,959 15,500 26,170 18,175 6,114 Total $9,848,640 $440,576 $826,077 $2,045,175 $6,536,812 (1) Includes interest rate swaps for $7.9 million. At December 31, 2007, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $22.9 million. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture for our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. We have sold all of these properties. All of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities (typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale), including environmental liabilities, for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement (see Note 24). Discontinued Operations On July 31, 2006, we sold our CLEC business Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI) for $255.3 million (including a later sale of associated real estate) in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. We recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of ELI of approximately $116.7 million. Our after tax gain on the sale was $71.6 million. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the sale was approximately $5.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the Federal and state level. 25 On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of Conference Call USA, LLC (CCUSA) for $43.6 million in cash. The pre tax gain on the sale of CCUSA was $14.1 million. Our after tax gain was $1.2 million. The book income taxes recorded upon sale are primarily attributable to a low tax basis in the assets sold. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, contingencies and purchase price allocations among others. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them. Telecommunications Bankruptcies Our estimate of anticipated losses related to telecommunications bankruptcies is a "critical accounting estimate." We have significant ongoing normal course business relationships with many telecom providers, some of which (in prior years) have filed for bankruptcy. We generally reserve approximately 95% of the net outstanding pre bankruptcy balances owed to us and believe that our estimate of the net realizable value of the amounts owed to us by bankrupt entities is appropriate. In 2007 and 2006, we had no "critical estimates" related to telecommunications bankruptcies. Asset Impairment In 2007 and 2006, we had no "critical estimates" related to asset impairments. Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets is performed annually. We adopted the lives proposed in the study effective October 1, 2007. Our "composite depreciation rate" increased from 5.25% to 5.45% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $350.0 million to $370.0 million for 2008. Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, we aggregate our reporting units into one ILEC segment. In determining fair value of goodwill during 2007 we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ILEC properties as well as trading values of our publicly traded common stock. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other post retirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are "critical accounting estimates." We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering a significant number of current and former employees and other post retirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The pension plans for the majority of our current employees are frozen. The accounting results for pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. 26 The discount rate is used to value, on a present basis, our pension and post retirement benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and post retirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term, high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and Bloomberg Finance and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. Our discount rate increased from 6.00% at year end 2006 to 6.50% at year end 2007. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and post retirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year and 10 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 35% to 55% in fixed income securities, 35% to 55% in equity securities and 5% to 15% in alternative investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. In 2007, we did not change our expected long term rate of return from the 8.25% used in 2006. Our pension plan assets are valued at actual market value as of the measurement date. Accounting standards in effect prior to December 31, 2006 required that we record an additional minimum pension liability when the plans "accumulated benefit obligation" exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at the pension plan measurement (balance sheet) date. In the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily due to a decrease in the year end discount rate, we recorded an additional minimum pension liability in the amount of $36.4 million with a corresponding charge to shareholders equity of $22.5 million, net of taxes of $13.9 million. These adjustments did not impact our net income or cash flows. We expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for 2008 will be $5.0 million to $10.0 million (they were $8.8 million in 2007, excluding a pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million) and that no contribution will be made by us to our pension plan in 2008. No contribution was made to our pension plans (which were merged into one plan at year end) during 2007. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates in 2006 and 2007 were approximately at the statutory rates, while in 2005 our effective tax rate was below the statutory rate level as a result of the completion of audits with federal and state taxing authorities and changes in the structure of certain of our subsidiaries. Contingencies At December 31, 2006, we had a reserve of $8.0 million in connection with a potential environmental claim in Bangor, Maine. This claim was settled with a payment of $7.625 million plus additional expenses during the third quarter of 2007. We currently do not have any contingencies in excess of $5.0 million recorded on our books. Purchase Price Allocation Commonwealth The allocation of the approximate $1.1 billion paid to the "fair market value" of the assets and liabilities of Commonwealth is a critical estimate. We have adjusted our preliminary estimate for the fair values assigned to plant, customer list, and goodwill to the final values. Additionally, the estimated expected life of a customer (used to amortize the customer list) is a critical estimate. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes." Among other things, FIN No. 48 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions either taken or expected to be taken in the Companys income tax returns. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of 2007. The total amount of our gross FIN No. 48 tax liability for tax positions that may not be sustained under a "more likely than not" threshold as of the date of adoption was $44.7 million (including $10.4 million acquired from CTE) and amounts to $66.0 million as of December 31, 2007. This amount includes an accrual for interest from the date the tax positions were taken in the amount of $6.2 million as of December 31, 2007. These balances include amounts of $9.0 million and $1.4 million for total FIN No. 48 tax liabilities and accrued interest, respectively, resulting from positions taken by Commonwealth which we 27 acquired in March 2007. An increase of $14.8 million in the balance since the date of adoption is attributable to a change made to the estimated useful life of an intangible asset for income tax purposes. This tax position is temporary in nature and, therefore, will not impact the Companys results of operations when ultimately settled in the future. The amount of our total FIN No. 48 tax liabilities reflected above that would positively impact the calculation of our effective income tax rate, if our tax positions are sustained, is $21.1 million as of December 31, 2007. The Companys policy regarding the classification of interest and penalties is to include these amounts as a component of income tax expense. This treatment of interest and penalties is consistent with prior periods. We have recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, additional interest in the amount of $1.2 million. We are subject to income tax examinations generally for the years 2003 forward for both our Federal and state filing jurisdictions. We maintain uncertain tax positions in various state jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that amounts related to previous asset dispositions and tax credits will change within the next 12 months, due to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations. This could favorably impact our results of operations by up to $7.0 million and reduce acquired goodwill balances by up to $3.0 million. Amounts related to all other positions that may change within the next twelve months are not material. The following new accounting standards were adopted by the Company without any financial statement impact. All of these standards are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. * How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement (EITF No. 06 3) * Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance (EITF No. 06 5) The following new accounting standards that will be adopted by the Company in 2008 and 2009 are currently being evaluated by the Company, but we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. * Accounting for Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF No. 06 4) * Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), as amended * Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159) * Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF No. 06 10) * Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R) 28 (b) Results of Operations In the paragraphs below, the Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude the effects of the acquisitions of CTE and GVN because of the aggregate magnitude of the acquisitions and their impact on the Companys financial results in 2007. The Companys variance explanations below are based upon an analysis of 2007 for Citizens (excluding CTE and GVN), except that the first sentence in each section of revenue or expense shows the revenue, expenses and or variances based upon an analysis of Citizens including the acquired properties. REVENUE Revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance and data and internet services. Such services are provided through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $262.6 million, or 13%, to $2,288.0 million as compared with the prior year. Excluding the additional revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions, revenue decreased $4.0 million during 2007, as compared with the prior year. During the first quarter of 2007, we had a significant favorable settlement of a dispute with a carrier that resulted in a favorable one time impact to our revenues of $38.7 million. Excluding the impact of our acquisitions and the one time favorable settlement, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been $1,982.7 million, a decrease of $42.7 million, or 2%, as compared to the prior year, primarily from a reduction of $39.9 million in subsidies received from federal and state funds. Consolidated revenue increased $8.3 million to $2.025 billion in 2006 from $2.017 billion in 2005. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to a 24% increase in high speed internet subscribers partially offset by a loss of access lines, a decline in the average rate per minute for long distance customers and an increase in bad debt expense. Change in the number of our access lines is important to our revenue and profitability. We have lost access lines primarily because of competition, changing consumer behavior, economic conditions, changing technology and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add high speed internet or cable modem service. Excluding the impact of our acquisitions, we lost approximately 130,300 access lines during 2007, but added approximately 66,700 high speed internet subscribers during this same period. Our GVN acquisition represented approximately 15,300 access lines and 4,200 high speed internet subscribers as of December 31, 2007. The loss of access lines during 2007 was primarily among residential customers. The non residential line losses were principally in our central and eastern regions and Rochester, New York, while the residential losses were throughout our markets. We expect to continue to lose access lines but to increase high speed internet subscribers during 2008. A continued loss of access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenues, profitability and cash flows to decrease in 2008. Our historical results include the results of operations of Commonwealth from the date of its acquisition on March 8, 2007 and of GVN from the date of its acquisition on October 31, 2007. The financial tables below include a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for 2007, 2006 and 2005. We have also presented an analysis of each category for 2007 for the results of Citizens (excluding CTE and GVN) and the results of our acquisitions: CTE for the last 23 days of March and the nine months ended December 31, 2007, and the results of GVN for the last two months of 2007, as included in the consolidated results of operations.

Excluding the additional local services revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $95.2 million, local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $29.0 million, or 4%, to $780.6 million as compared with the prior year. The loss of access lines accounted for $28.7 million of the decline in local revenue, partially offset by rate increases in Rochester, New York on residential lines that became effective August of 2006 and 2007. Local services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $20.1 million, or 2%, as compared with the prior year. Local revenue decreased $25.9 million, primarily due to continued losses of access lines partially offset by a local rate increase on some of our Rochester residential access lines effective August 2006. 2005 reflected a reserve of $4.0 million associated with a state rate of return limitation on earnings. Enhanced services revenue increased $5.8 million, primarily due to sales of additional feature packages. Economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our packages and bundles and cause us to lower our prices for those products and services, which would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow. Data and Internet Services Data and internet services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $119.6 million, or 28%, to $543.8 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional data and internet services revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $58.9 million, data and internet services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 increased $60.6 million, or 14%, and $58.6 million, or 16%, respectively, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to growth in data and high speed internet services. As of December 31, 2007, the number of the Companys high speed internet subscribers increased by 66,700, or 17%, since December 31, 2006. Data and internet services also includes revenue from data transmission services to other carriers and high volume commercial customers with dedicated high capacity circuits like DS 1s and DS 3s. Revenue from these dedicated high capacity circuits increased $19.8 million in 2007 and $9.1 million in 2006, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. Access Services Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $51.5 million, or 12%, to $479.5 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional access services revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $70.2 million, access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $18.7 million, or 5%, as compared with the prior year. Switched access revenue of $284.6 million increased $21.2 million, or 8%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to the settlement in the first quarter of a dispute with a carrier resulting in a favorable impact on our revenue of $38.7 million (a one time event), partially offset by the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses. Access service revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies. Subsidy revenue of $124.7 million decreased $39.9 million, primarily due to lower receipts under the Federal High Cost Fund program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the programs National Average Cost Per Local Loop (NACPL), along with reductions in Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharges due to the elimination of high speed internet units from the USF calculation. Access services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $3.4 million, or 1%, as compared with the prior year. Switched access revenue decreased $13.9 million to $263.4 million. Approximately $24.0 million of the switched access decline was attributable to a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses. This decline was offset by approximately $9.3 million of disputed carrier activity resolved in the Companys favor during the fourth quarter of 2006. Subsidy revenue increased $10.5 million to $164.6 million in 2006, primarily due to increased receipts from the Federal High Cost Fund due to higher costs in the base year, as well as increased receipts from state high cost funds. Increases in the number of Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Companies (including wireless companies) receiving federal subsidies, among other factors, may lead to further increases in the NACPL, thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future. The FCC and state regulators are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies. The FCC is also reviewing the mechanism by which subsidies are funded. Additionally, the FCC has an open proceeding to address reform to access charges and other intercarrier compensation. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided nor the effect on our subsidy or access revenues. Future reductions in our subsidy and access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have associated variable expenses. 30 Long Distance Services Long distance services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $27.3 million, or 18%, to $180.5 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional long distance services revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $27.1 million, long distance services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was relatively unchanged as compared with the prior year, despite an increase of 13% in our long distance minutes of use. Long distance services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $16.2 million, or 10% from 2005, primarily due to a decline in the average rate per minute. Our long distance minutes of use increased during 2006. During 2007, we actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings. The sale of our digital phone and state unlimited products, and its associated unlimited minutes, has resulted in an increase in long distance customers, and the minutes used by those customers. This has lowered our overall average rate per minute billed. Our long distance minutes of use increased during 2007 and 2006, as compared to the prior years and, as noted below in network access expenses, has increased our cost of services provided. Our long distance services revenues have remained relatively unchanged, but may decrease in the future due to lower rates and or minutes of use. Competing services such as wireless, VOIP and cable telephony are resulting in a loss of customers, minutes of use and further declines in the rates we charge our customers. Directory Services Directory services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $0.4 million to $114.6 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional directory services revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $1.3 million, directory services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $0.8 million, or 1%, as compared with the prior year with slightly lower revenues from yellow pages advertising, mainly in Rochester, New York. Directory services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.0 million, or 1%, as compared with the prior year due to growth in yellow pages advertising. Other Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $2.3 million, or 2%, to $93.9 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional other revenue due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $13.9 million, other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $16.2 million, or 17%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in bad debt expense, the impact of a $3.4 million reduction in revenue for our free video promotions with a multi year customer commitment in some of our markets, a decrease in service activation billing of $2.5 million and a decrease of $1.8 million in wireless revenue from the Mohave Cellular Limited Partnership. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $11.6 million, or 11%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $7.5 million and decreases of $2.3 million for promotional credits, $1.8 million in sales of customer premise equipment (CPE) and $1.6 million in "bill and collect" fee revenue. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.5 million in cellular roaming revenue from the Mohave Cellular Limited Partnership.

The amount is $79.94 without the $38.7 million favorable impact from the settlement. 31 NETWORK ACCESS EXPENSES 2007 2006 2005 Citizens ($ in thousands) As (excluding Reported Acquisitions CTE and GVN) $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Network access $ 228,242 $ 35,781 $ 192,461 $ 21,214 12% $ 171,247 $ 14,425 9% $ 156,822 Network access Consolidated network access expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $57.0 million, or 33%, to $228.2 million as compared to the prior year ($35.8 million of which was attributable to our 2007 acquisitions). Excluding the additional network access expenses due to the 2007 acquisitions of CTE and GVN, network access expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 increased $21.2 million and $14.4 million, or 12% and 9%, respectively, as compared with the prior year. The increases in network costs for 2007 and 2006, are primarily due to increasing rates and usage related to our long distance product and our data backbone. Additionally, in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006, we expensed $11.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively, of promotional costs associated with fourth quarter high speed internet promotions that subsidized the cost of a new personal computer or a new digital camera in 2007, and a new personal computer in 2006, provided to customers that entered into a multi year commitment for certain bundled services. As we continue to increase our sales of data products such as high speed internet and expand the availability of our unlimited long distance calling plans, our network access expense is likely to continue to increase. A decline in expenses associated with access line losses, has offset some of the increase. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES 2007 2006 2005 Citizens ($ in thousands) As (excluding Reported Acquisitions CTE and GVN) $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Wage and benefit expenses $381,326 $ 28,907 $ 352,419 $ (6,408) 2% $ 358,827 $ (23,841) 6% $ 382,668 Severance and early retirement costs 13,874 13,874 6,681 93% 7,193 212 3% 6,981 Stock based compensation 9,022 9,022 (1,318) 13% 10,340 1,913 23% 8,427 All other operating expenses 404,279 72,086 * 332,193 (24,590) 7% 356,783 3,812 1% 352,971 $808,501 $100,993 $ 707,508 $ (25,635) 3% $ 733,143 $ (17,904) 2% $ 751,047 * Includes $33.0 million of common corporate costs allocated to the CTE operations during 2007. Consolidated other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $75.4 million, or 10%, to $808.5 million as compared to the prior year, primarily the result of our 2007 acquisitions of CTE and GVN. Other operating expenses were impacted as follows: Wage and benefit expenses Wage and benefit expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $22.5 million, or 6%, to $381.3 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional wage and benefit expenses due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $28.9 million, wage and benefit expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $6.4 million, or 2%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to headcount reductions and associated decreases in compensation and benefit costs. Wage and benefit expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $23.8 million, or 6%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to headcount reductions, and associated decreases in compensation and benefits, and improved expense control in benefit costs. Included in our "As Reported" wage and benefit expenses is pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. The amounts for 2007 include the costs for our recently acquired Commonwealth plans and reflect the positive impact of a pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million, resulting from the freeze placed on certain pension benefits of the former Commonwealth non union employees. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses (which were $8.8 million in 2007, including the costs associated with the Commonwealth plans, except for the pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million), will be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million in 2008, and that no contribution will be required to be made by us to the pension plan in 2008. No contribution was made to our pension plans during 2007. In future periods, if the value of our pension assets decline and or projected benefit costs increase, we may have increased pension and or postretirement expenses. Also, effective December 31, 2007, the CTE Employees Pension Plan was merged into the Citizens Pension Plan. 32 Severance and early retirement costs Severance and early retirement costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $6.7 million, or 93%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to a third quarter charge of approximately $12.1 million related to ongoing initiatives to enhance customer service, streamline operations and reduce costs. Approximately 120 positions have been eliminated as part of that initiative, most of which have been filled by new employees at our remaining call centers. In addition, approximately 50 field operations employees agreed to participate in an early retirement program and another 30 employees from a variety of functions have left the Company. Severance and early retirement costs for the year ending December 31, 2006 increased slightly from the prior year. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $1.3 million, or 13%, as compared with the prior year due to reduced costs associated with stock options, since we have fewer stock option grants that remain unvested compared to 2006. Stock based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $1.9 million, or 23%, as compared with the prior year due to expensing the cost, which began in 2006, of the unvested portion of outstanding stock options pursuant to SFAS No. 123R. All other operating expenses All other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $47.5 million, or 13%, to $404.3 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the additional expenses due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $72.1 million, all other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $24.6 million, or 7%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to the allocation of common corporate costs over a larger base of operations, which now includes Commonwealth. Our purchase of Commonwealth has enabled us to realize cost savings by leveraging our centralized back office, customer service and administrative support functions over a larger customer base. Additionally, our USF contribution rate and PUC fees decreased from the prior year period, resulting in a reduction in costs of $13.1 million in 2007. An increase in consulting and other outside services of $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 offset some of the decrease in expenses noted above. All other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $3.8 million, or 1%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to sales and marketing expenses that increased due to a competitive environment and the launch of new products.

Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $69.4 million, or 15%, to $545.9 million as compared to the prior year as a result of our 2007 acquisitions of CTE and GVN. Excluding the impact of our 2007 acquisitions, depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 decreased $21.0 million, or 6%, and $43.7 million, or 11%, respectively, as compared with the prior years due to a declining net asset base partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets is performed annually. We adopted the lives proposed in the study effective October 1, 2007. Our "composite depreciation rate" increased from 5.25% to 5.45% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $350.0 million to $370.0 million for 2008. 33 INVESTMENT INCOME/OTHER INCOME (LOSS), NET / INTEREST EXPENSE / INCOME TAX EXPENSE 2007 2006 2005 Citizens ($ in thousands) As (excluding Reported Acquisitions CTE and GVN) $ Change % Change Amount $ Change % Change Amount Investment income $ 35,781 $ 402 $ 35,379 $ (44,057) 55% $ 79,436 $ 67,213 550% $ 12,223 Other income (loss), net $ (17,833) $ 4,978 $ (22,811) $ (25,818) 859% $ 3,007 $ 2,251 298% $ 756 Interest expense $ 380,696 $ (260) $ 380,956 $ 44,510 13% $ 336,446 $ (2,289) 1% $ 338,735 Income tax expense $ 128,014 $ 27,013 $ 101,001 $ (35,478) 26% $ 136,479 $ 61,209 81% $ 75,270 Investment Income Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $43.7 million, or 55%, to $35.8 million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the investment income due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $0.4 million, investment income for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $44.1 million, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to the $64.6 million in proceeds received in 2006 from the RTB liquidation and dissolution, partially offset by an increase of $10.8 million in income from short term investments of cash and lower minority interest in joint ventures of $2.3 million. We borrowed $550.0 million in December 2006 in anticipation of the Commonwealth acquisition in 2007. Our average cash balance was $594.2 million and $429.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $67.2 million, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $6.4 million in income from higher cash balances during the year arising from the $64.6 million of cash received from the liquidation and dissolution of the RTB (and gain recognized of $61.4 million), the $255.3 million in cash received from the sale of ELI and the postponement of our stock repurchase and debt repurchase programs during the second half of 2006 in connection with our acquisition of Commonwealth. Other Income (Loss), net Other income (loss), net for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $20.8 million to ($17.8) million as compared to the prior year. Excluding the other income due to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $5.0 million, other income (loss), net for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $25.8 million to ($22.8) million as compared to prior year, primarily due to the premium paid of $18.2 million on the early retirement of debt during 2007 and a bridge loan fee of $4.1 million. Other income (loss), net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $2.3 million, as compared to the prior year. Other income (loss), net for 2006 consists primarily of insurance proceeds of $4.2 million, a loss of $2.4 million on the exchange of debt, an expense of $1.0 million for legal matters and gains recognized on the extinguishment of approximately $3.5 million of retained liabilities of our disposed water properties. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $44.5 million, or 13%, to $381.0 million as compared with the prior year, primarily due to $637.6 million of higher average debt resulting from financing the Commonwealth acquisition. Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the prior year was 18 basis points lower, decreasing from 8.12% to 7.94%. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $2.3 million, or 1%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to slightly lower average debt levels, partially offset by higher short term interest rates that we paid on our swap agreements ($550.0 million in principal amount was swapped to floating rate at December 31, 2006). Our composite average borrowing rate for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with the prior year was 18 basis points higher, increasing from 7.94% to 8.12%. Our average debt outstanding was $4,834.5 million, $4,196.9 million and $4,260.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased $35.5 million, or 26%, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to changes in taxable income. The overall effective tax rate for 2007 was 37.4% as compared with an effective tax rate of 34.9% for 2006. The Companys overall effective tax rate increased in 2007 mainly due to changes in permanent difference items and tax contingencies. 34 We paid $54.4 million in cash taxes during 2007, an increase of $49.0 million over 2006, reflecting the utilization of our tax loss carryforwards in prior years. We expect to pay approximately $130.0 million to $140.0 million in 2008. Our 2008 cash tax estimate does not reflect the impact of the "Economic Stimulus Act of 2008," which we are currently evaluating. Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $61.2 million, as compared with the prior year, primarily due to changes in taxable income. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 34.9%, as compared with an effective tax rate of 28.6% for 2005. We utilized a substantial amount of tax loss carryforwards as a result of the sale of ELI and receipt of RTB proceeds in 2006.

We recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of ELI of approximately $116.7 million. Our after tax gain on the sale was $71.6 million. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the sale was approximately $5.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the Federal and state level. On March 15, 2005, we completed the sale of CCUSA for $43.6 million in cash. The pre tax gain on the sale of CCUSA was $14.1 million. Our after tax gain was $1.2 million. The book income taxes recorded upon sale are primarily attributable to a low tax basis in assets sold. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business or to hedge long term interest rate risk. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio and interest on our long term debt. The long term debt includes various instruments with various maturities and weighted average interest rates. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, all but $148.5 million of our borrowings have fixed interest rates. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2007, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In order to manage our interest expense, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of the agreements, which qualify for hedge accounting, we made semi annual, floating interest rate payments based on six month LIBOR and received a fixed rate on the notional amount. The underlying variable rate for these interest rate swaps is set in arrears. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net cash interest payment resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $2.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. 35 On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our Senior Notes due in 2011 and 2013. We received cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million in January 2008. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 7.94% and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately 13 years. There has been no material change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since December 31, 2006. Our long term debt as of December 31, 2007 was approximately 97% fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes after the termination of our remaining interest rate swap agreements on January 15, 2008. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of December 31, 2007 is limited to our pension assets of $822.2 million. We have no other security investments of any material amount.
