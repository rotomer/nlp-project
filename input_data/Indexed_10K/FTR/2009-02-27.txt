Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, and our future results may be materially affected by, any of the following possibilities: * Reductions in the number of our access lines and High Speed Internet subscribers; * The effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise); * Reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition and or technology substitutions; * The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; * The effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets we serve, which can impact demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenue and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; * Our ability to effectively manage service quality; * Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers; * Our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and subsidies; * Changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; * The effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, including potential changes in state rate of return limitations on our earnings, access charges and subsidy payments, and regulatory network upgrade and reliability requirements; * Our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to reduce or refinance our debt; * Adverse changes in the credit markets and or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability of, and or increase the cost of financing; * The effects of bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in increased bad debts; * The effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; * The effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; 20 * Changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and or federal or state tax assessments; * Further declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which could require us to make contributions to the pension plan beginning in 2010; * The effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; * Our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2009 and thereafter; * Our ability to pay a $1.00 per common share dividend annually, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes (which will increase in 2009) and our liquidity; * The effects of significantly increased cash taxes in 2009 and thereafter; * The effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; * The possible impact of adverse changes in political or other external factors over which we have no control; and * The effects of hurricanes, ice storms and other severe weather. Any of the foregoing events, or other events, could cause financial information to vary from managements forward looking statements included in this report. You should consider these important factors, as well as the risks set forth under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" above, in evaluating any statement in this report on Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. Overview We are a full service communications provider and one of the largest exchange telephone carriers in the country. On July 31, 2006, we sold our competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI). We accounted for ELI as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations. On March 8, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, Inc. (Commonwealth or CTE), which included a small CLEC component. This acquisition expanded our presence in Pennsylvania and strengthened our position as a leading full service communications provider to rural markets. On October 31, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Global Valley Networks, Inc. and GVN Services (together GVN), which expanded our presence in California and also strengthened our rural position. As of December 31, 2008, we operated in 24 states with approximately 5,700 employees. Competition in the telecommunications industry is intense and increasing. We experience competition from many telecommunications service providers, including cable operators offering VOIP products, wireless carriers, long distance providers, competitive local exchange carriers, internet providers and other wireline carriers. We believe that as of December 31, 2008, approximately 65% of the households in our territories had VOIP as an available service option from cable operators. We also believe that competition will continue to intensify in 2009 and may result in reduced revenues. Our business experienced a decline in access lines and switched access minutes in 2007 and 2008, primarily as a result of competition and business downsizing. We also experienced a reduction in revenue in 2008 as compared to 2007. The recent severe contraction in the global financial markets and ongoing recession may be impacting consumer behavior to reduce household expenditures by not purchasing our services and or by discontinuing some or all of our services. These trends are likely to continue and may result in a challenging revenue environment. These factors could also result in increased delinquencies and bankruptcies and, therefore, affect our ability to collect money owed to us by residential and business customers. We employ a number of strategies to combat the competitive pressures and changes to consumer behavior noted above. Our strategies are focused in the following areas: customer retention, upgrading and up selling services to our existing customer base, new customer growth, win backs, new product deployment, and operating expense and capital expenditure reductions. 21 We hope to achieve our customer retention goals by bundling services around the local access line and providing exemplary customer service. Bundled services include High Speed Internet, unlimited long distance calling, enhanced telephone features and video offerings. We tailor these services to the needs of our residential and business customers in the markets we serve and continually evaluate the introduction of new and complementary products and services, which can also be purchased separately. Customer retention is also enhanced by offering one, two and three year price protection plans where customers commit to a term in exchange for predictable pricing and or promotional offers. Additionally, we are focused on enhancing the customer experience as we believe exceptional customer service will differentiate us from our competition. Our commitment to providing exemplary customer service is demonstrated by the expansion of our customer services hours, shorter scheduling windows for in home appointments and the implementation of call reminders and follow up calls for service appointments. In addition, due to a recent realignment and restructuring of approximately 70 local area markets, those markets are now operated by local managers with responsibility for the customer experience, as well as the financial results, in those markets. We utilize targeted and innovative promotions to sell new customers, including those moving into our territory, win back previously lost customers, upgrade and up sell existing customers a variety of service offerings including High Speed Internet, video, and enhanced long distance and feature packages in order to maximize the average revenue per access line (wallet share) paid to Frontier. Depending upon market and economic conditions, we may offer such promotions to drive sales in the future. Lastly, we are focused on introducing a number of new products that our customers desire, including unlimited long distance minutes, bundles of long distance minutes, wireless data, internet portal advertising and the "Frontier Peace of Mind" product suite. This last category is a suite of products aimed at managing the total communications and personal computing experience for our customers. The Peace of Mind product and services are designed to provide value and simplicity to meet our customers ever changing needs. The Peace of Mind product and services suite includes services such as an in home, full installation of our high speed product, two hour appointment windows for the installation, hard drive back up services, enhanced help desk PC support and inside wire maintenance. We offer a portion of our Peace of Mind services, including hard drive back up services and enhanced help desk PC support, both to our customers and to other users inside and outside of our service territories. Although we are optimistic about the opportunities provided by each of these initiatives, we can provide no assurance about their long term profitability or impact on revenue. We believe that the combination of offering multiple products and services to our customers pursuant to price protection programs, billing them on a single bill, providing superior customer service, and being active in our local communities will make our customers more loyal to us, and will help us generate new, and retain existing, customer revenue. Revenues from data and internet services such as High Speed Internet continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from services such as local line and access charges (including federal and state subsidies) are decreasing as a percentage of our total revenues. Federal and state subsidy revenue was $119.8 million in 2008, or 5% of our revenues, down from $130.0 million in 2007, or 6% of our revenues. We expect this trend to continue in 2009. The decreasing revenue from traditional sources, along with the potential for increasing operating costs, could cause our profitability and our cash generated by operations to decrease. 22 (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $163.6 million. Our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we used cash flow from operations, incremental borrowings and cash on hand to fund all of our investing and financing activities, including debt repayments and stock repurchases. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt payments through 2009, pay taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy and support our short term and long term operating strategies. However, a number of factors, including but not limited to, increased cash taxes, losses of access lines, increases in competition, lower subsidy and access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated by operations. In addition, although we believe, based on information available to us, that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us, given the current economic environment and the recent severe contraction in the global financial markets, this could change in the future. Further, the current credit market turmoil and our below investment grade credit ratings may make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt, although we do not have any significant maturities until 2011. We have approximately $3.9 million and $7.2 million of debt maturing in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Cash Flow provided by and used in Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities declined $82.4 million, or 10%, for 2008 as compared to 2007. The decline resulted from a drop in operating income, as adjusted for non cash items, lower investment income, a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in current income tax expenditures. These declines were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable that positively impacted our cash position as compared to the prior year. We have in recent years paid relatively low amounts of cash taxes. We expect that in 2009 and beyond our cash taxes will increase substantially, as our federal net operating loss carryforwards and AMT tax credit carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized. We paid $78.9 million in cash taxes during 2008, and expect to pay approximately $90.0 million to $110.0 million in 2009. Our 2009 cash tax estimate reflects the anticipated favorable impact of bonus depreciation that is part of the economic stimulus package signed into law by President Obama. Cash Flow used by and provided from Investing Activities Acquisitions On March 8, 2007, we acquired Commonwealth in a cash and stock taxable transaction, for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. We paid $804.1 million in cash ($663.7 million net, after cash acquired) and issued common stock with a value of approximately $249.8 million. In connection with the acquisition of Commonwealth, we assumed $35.0 million of debt under a revolving credit facility and $191.8 million face amount of Commonwealth convertible notes (fair value of $209.6 million). During March 2007, we paid down the $35.0 million credit facility. We retired all of the Commonwealth notes as of December 31, 2008. On October 31, 2007, we acquired GVN for a total cash consideration of $62.0 million. Rural Telephone Bank We received approximately $64.6 million in cash from the dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) in April 2006, which resulted in the recognition of a pre tax gain of approximately $61.4 million during the second quarter of 2006, as reflected in investment income in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our tax net operating losses were used to absorb the cash liability for taxes. Sale of ELI During 2006, we sold ELI, our CLEC business (including its associated real estate), for $255.3 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. 23 Capital Expenditures In 2008, our capital expenditures were $288.3 million. We continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $250.0 million to $270.0 million for 2009. Cash Flow used by and provided from Financing Activities Debt Reduction and Debt Exchanges In 2008, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $144.7 million of debt, consisting of $128.7 million principal amount of our 9.25% Senior Notes due 2011, $12.0 million of other senior unsecured debt and rural utilities service loan contracts, and $4.0 million of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities (EPPICS). In 2007, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $967.2 million of debt, including $3.3 million of EPPICS, and $17.8 million of 3.25% Commonwealth convertible notes that were converted into our common stock. On April 26, 2007, we redeemed $495.2 million principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2008 at a price of 103.041% plus accrued and unpaid interest. During the first quarter of 2007, we borrowed and repaid $200.0 million utilized to temporarily fund the acquisition of Commonwealth, and we paid down the $35.0 million Commonwealth credit facility. Through December 31, 2007, we retired $183.3 million face amount of Commonwealth convertible notes for which we paid $165.4 million in cash and $36.7 million in common stock. We also paid down $44.6 million of industrial development revenue bonds and $4.3 million of rural utilities service loan contracts. In 2006, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $251.0 million of debt, including $15.9 million of EPPICS that were converted into our common stock. During the first quarter of 2006, we entered into two debt for debt exchanges of our debt securities. As a result, $47.5 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 were exchanged for approximately $47.4 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into four debt for debt exchanges and exchanged $157.3 million of our 7.625% notes due 2008 for $149.9 million of our 9.00% notes due 2031. The 9.00% notes are callable on the same general terms and conditions as the 7.625% notes exchanged. No cash was exchanged in these transactions. However, with respect to the first quarter debt exchanges, a non cash pre tax loss of approximately $2.4 million was recognized in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," which is included in other income (loss), net. On June 1, 2006, we retired at par our entire $175.0 million principal amount of 7.60% Debentures due June 1, 2006. On June 14, 2006, we repurchased $22.7 million of our 6.75% Senior Notes due August 17, 2006 at a price of 100.181% of par. On August 17, 2006, we retired at par the $29.1 million remaining balance of the 6.75% Senior Notes. We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market, through tender offers, exchanges of debt securities, by exercising rights to call or in privately negotiated transactions. We may also refinance existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations. Issuance of Debt Securities On March 28, 2008, we borrowed $135.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan facility that was established on March 10, 2008. The loan matures in 2013 and bears interest based on the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our election, plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio. We used the proceeds to repurchase, during the first quarter of 2008, $128.7 million principal amount of our 9.25% Senior Notes due 2011 and to pay for the $6.3 million of premium on early retirement of those notes. On March 23, 2007, we issued in a private placement an aggregate $300.0 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and $450.0 million principal amount of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2019. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down $200.0 million principal amount of indebtedness incurred on March 8, 2007 under a bridge loan facility in connection with the acquisition of Commonwealth and redeem, on April 26, 2007, $495.2 million principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2008. In the second quarter of 2007, we completed an exchange offer (to publicly register the debt) for the $750.0 million in total of private placement notes described above, in addition to the $400.0 million principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2027 issued in a private placement on December 22, 2006, for registered notes. 24 On December 22, 2006, we issued in a private placement, $400.0 million principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2027. Proceeds from the sale were used to partially finance our acquisition of Commonwealth. These notes were exchanged for registered securities, as described above. In December 2006, we borrowed $150.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan agreement. The loan matures in 2012 and bears interest based on an average prime rate or LIBOR, at our election, plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio. We used the proceeds to partially finance our acquisition of Commonwealth. EPPICS As of December 31, 2008, there was no EPPICS related debt outstanding to third parties. The following disclosure provides the history regarding this issuance. In 1996, our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust (the Trust), issued, in an underwritten public offering, 4,025,000 shares of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 (Trust Convertible Preferred Securities or EPPICS), representing preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust, with a liquidation preference of $50 per security (for a total liquidation amount of $201.3 million). These securities had an adjusted conversion price of $11.46 per share of our common stock. The conversion price was reduced from $13.30 to $11.46 during the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the $2.00 per share of common stock special, non recurring dividend. The proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase $207.5 million aggregate liquidation amount of 5% Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 from another wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Capital L.P. (the Partnership). The proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase from us $211.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2036. The sole assets of the Trust were the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities, and our Convertible Subordinated Debentures were substantially all the assets of the Partnership. Our obligations under the agreements relating to the issuances of such securities, taken together, constituted a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trusts obligations relating to the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and the Partnerships obligations relating to the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities. In accordance with the terms of the issuances, we paid the annual 5% interest in quarterly installments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Cash was paid (net of investment returns) to the Partnership in payment of the interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The cash was then distributed by the Partnership to the Trust and then by the Trust to the holders of the EPPICS. As of December 31, 2008, EPPICS representing a total principal amount of $197.8 million have been converted into 15,969,645 shares of our common stock. There were no outstanding EPPICS as of December 31, 2008. As a result of the redemption of all outstanding EPPICS as of December 31, 2008, the $10.5 million in debt with related parties was reclassified by the Company against an offsetting investment. Interest Rate Management On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our Senior Notes due in 2011 and 2013. Cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million were received in January 2008. The related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet, and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt. For 2008, we recognized $5.0 million of deferred gain and anticipate recognizing an additional $3.4 million of deferred gain during 2009. The notional amounts of fixed rate indebtedness hedged as of December 31, 2007 were $400.0 million. Such contracts required us to pay variable rates of interest (estimated average pay rates of approximately 8.54% as of December 31, 2007) and receive fixed rates of interest (average receive rate of 8.50% as of December 31, 2007). All swaps were accounted for under SFAS No. 133 (as amended) as fair value hedges. For 2007 and 2006, the interest expense resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $2.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Credit Facility As of December 31, 2008, we had available lines of credit with seven financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $250.0 million and there were no outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the facility. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our debt leverage ratio, and were 0.225% per annum as of December 31, 2008. The expiration date for this $250.0 million five year revolving credit agreement is May 18, 2012. During the term of the credit facility we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds subject to customary conditions. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but 25 may not be used to fund dividend payments. Although we believe, based on information available to us, that the financial institutions syndicated under our credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments, given the current economic environment and the recent severe contraction in the global financial markets, this could change in the future. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facility agreements include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with U.S. GAAP, restrictions on the allowance of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract, rule or regulation, other than those imposed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. However, we would be restricted under our credit facilities from declaring dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time or will result from the dividend declaration. Our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), which matures in 2011, contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.00 to 1. Our $250.0 million credit facility, and our $150.0 million and $135.0 million senior unsecured term loans, each contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.50 to 1. Although all of these facilities are unsecured, they will be equally and ratably secured by certain liens and equally and ratably guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries if we issue debt that is secured or guaranteed. Our credit facilities and certain indentures for our senior unsecured debt obligations limit our ability to create liens or merge or consolidate with other companies and our subsidiaries ability to borrow funds, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities We receive proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options pursuant to our stock based compensation plans. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we received approximately $1.4 million, $13.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. Share Repurchase Programs In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. This share repurchase program commenced on March 4, 2008 and was completed on October 3, 2008. During 2008, we repurchased 17,778,300 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $200.0 million. In February 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. This share repurchase program commenced on March 19, 2007 and was completed on October 15, 2007. During 2007, we repurchased 17,279,600 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $250.0 million. In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock in public or private transactions over the following twelve month period. This share repurchase program commenced on March 6, 2006. During 2006, we repurchased 10,199,900 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $135.2 million. No further purchases were made prior to expiration of this authorization. Dividends We expect to pay regular quarterly dividends. Our ability to fund a regular quarterly dividend will be impacted by our ability to generate cash from operations. The declarations and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, restrictions in our credit facilities and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. 26 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008 is as follows: Contractual Obligations: ($ in thousands) Payment due by period Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Long term debt obligations, excluding interest $ 4,732,488 $ 3,857 $ 1,132,379 $ 1,009,497 $ 2,586,755 Interest on long term debt 4,507,391 357,600 676,162 494,675 2,978,954 Operating lease obligations 66,500 22,654 21,499 12,781 9,566 Purchase obligations 34,142 23,286 10,196 330 330 FIN No. 48 liability 48,711 1,493 34,433 12,780 5 Total $ 9,389,232 $ 408,890 $ 1,874,669 $ 1,530,063 $ 5,575,610 At December 31, 2008, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $21.9 million. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan to divest our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. We have sold all of these properties. All of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities (typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale), including environmental liabilities, for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement (see Note 24). Discontinued Operations On July 31, 2006, we sold our CLEC business, Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI) for $255.3 million (including a later sale of associated real estate) in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. We recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of ELI of approximately $116.7 million. Our after tax gain on the sale was $71.6 million. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the sale was approximately $5.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the Federal and state level. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, contingencies and purchase price allocations among others. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates. 27 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of collectability of our accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts. In 2008 and 2007, we had no "critical estimates" related to telecommunications bankruptcies. Asset Impairment In 2008 and 2007, we had no "critical estimates" related to asset impairments. Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, we aggregate our four operating segments into one reportable segment. In determining fair value of goodwill during 2008 we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ILEC properties as well as trading values of our publicly traded common stock. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets is performed annually. We adopted the lives proposed in the study effective October 1, 2008. Our "composite depreciation rate" increased from 5.5% to 5.6% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $350.0 million to $370.0 million for 2009. We periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are "critical accounting estimates." We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering a significant number of current and former employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The pension plans for the majority of our current employees are frozen. The accounting results for pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. The discount rate is used to value, on a present basis, our pension and postretirement benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term, high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve, the Citigroup Above Median Pension Curve, the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. Our discount rate was 6.50% at year end 2008 and 2007. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in determining the periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 35% to 55% in fixed income securities, 35% to 55% in equity securities and 5% to 15% in alternative investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year. In 2008, we did not change our expected long term rate of return from the 8.25% used in 2007. Our pension plan assets are valued at actual market value as of the measurement date. 28 We expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for 2009 will be $50.0 million to $55.0 million (they were $11.2 million in 2008), and that we may be required to make a cash contribution to our pension plan beginning in 2010. No contribution was made to our pension plan during 2008. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates in 2006, 2007 and 2008 were approximately at the statutory rates. Contingencies At December 31, 2006, we had a reserve of $8.0 million in connection with a potential environmental claim in Bangor, Maine. This claim was settled with a payment of $7.625 million plus additional expenses during the third quarter of 2007. We currently do not have any contingencies in excess of $5.0 million recorded on our books. Purchase Price Allocation Commonwealth and GVN The allocation of the approximate $1.1 billion paid to the "fair market value" of the assets and liabilities of Commonwealth is a critical estimate. We finalized our estimate of the fair values assigned to plant, customer list and goodwill, as more fully described in Notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the estimated expected life of a customer (used to amortize the customer list) is a critical estimate. New Accounting Pronouncements The following new accounting standards were adopted by the Company in 2008 without any material financial statement impact. All of these standards are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. * Accounting for Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF No. 06 4) * Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) * The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159) * Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF No. 06 10) * Accounting for the Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards (EITF No. 06 11) * The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162) The following new accounting standards that will be adopted by the Company in 2009 are currently being evaluated by the Company, but we do not expect their adoption to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. * Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), as amended * Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R) * Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160) * Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1) * Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP SFAS 132 (R) 1) 29 (b) Results of Operations Our historical results include the results of operations of CTE from the date of its acquisition on March 8, 2007 and of GVN from the date of its acquisition on October 31, 2007. Accordingly, results of operations for 2008, 2007 and 2006 are not directly comparable as 2008 results reflect the inclusion of a full year of operations of CTE and GVN, whereas 2007 results reflect the inclusion of approximately ten months of operations of CTE and of two months of operations of GVN and 2006 results do not reflect the results of operations of CTE or GVN. REVENUE Revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance and data and internet services. Such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. Consolidated revenue for 2008 decreased $51.0 million, or 2%, to $2,237.0 million as compared to 2007. Excluding additional revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for a full year in 2008 and for a partial period in 2007, our revenue decreased $107.3 million during 2008, or 5%, as compared to 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, we had a significant favorable settlement of a carrier dispute that resulted in a favorable one time impact to our revenue of $38.7 million. Excluding the additional revenue due to the one time favorable settlement in the first quarter of 2007 and the additional revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions in 2008 and 2007, our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined $68.6 million, or 3%, as compared to the prior year. This decline is a result of lower local services revenue, subsidy revenue and switched access revenue, partially offset by a $37.3 million, or 8%, increase in data and internet services revenue, each as described in more detail below. Consolidated revenue for 2007 increased $262.6 million, or 13%, to $2,288.0 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions in 2007, and the one time favorable settlement as referenced above in 2007, our revenue for 2007 was $1,982.7 million, a decrease of $42.7 million, or 2%, as compared to 2006, primarily resulting from a reduction of $39.9 million in subsidies received from federal and state funds. Change in the number of our access lines is one factor that is important to our revenue and profitability. We have lost access lines primarily because of competition, changing consumer behavior (including wireless substitution), economic conditions, changing technology and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add High Speed Internet or cable modem service. We lost approximately 174,800 access lines (net), including 22,200 second lines, during 2008, but added approximately 57,100 High Speed Internet subscribers (net) during this same period. We expect to continue to lose access lines but to increase High Speed Internet subscribers during 2009 (although not enough to offset access line losses). While the number of access lines are an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends, it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate the business. Management believes that understanding different components of revenue is most important. For this reason, presented on page 33 is a breakdown that categorizes revenue into customer revenue and regulatory revenue (switched and subsidy revenue). Despite the decline in access lines, our customer revenue, which is all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue, also improved by more than 1.3 percent in 2008 versus 2007. The average monthly customer revenue per access line has improved and resulted in an increased wallet share, primarily from residential customers. A substantial further loss of access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue, profitability and cash flows to decrease in 2009. Our historical results include the results of operations of Commonwealth from the date of its acquisition on March 8, 2007 and of GVN from the date of its acquisition on October 31, 2007. The financial tables below include a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for 2008, 2007 and 2006. We have also presented an analysis of each category for 2007 for the results of Frontier (excluding CTE and GVN) and the results of our acquisitions: CTE from March 8, 2007 through December 31, 2007, and the results of GVN for the last two months of 2007, as included in the consolidated results of operations. The figures in each of the charts in this section for 2007 relate to Frontier legacy properties (excluding CTE and GVN). 30 REVENUE 2008 2007 2006 ($ in thousands) Frontier (excluding Amount $ Change % Change Amount Acquisitions CTE and GVN) $ Change % Change Amount Local services $ 848,393 $ ( 27,369) 3% $ 875,762 $ 95,197 $ 780,565 $(29,019) 4% $ 809,584 Data and internet services 605,615 61,851 11% 543,764 58,934 484,830 60,621 14% 424,209 Access services 404,713 (74,749) 16% 479,462 70,235 409,227 (18,732) 4% 427,959 Long distance services 182,559 2,034 1% 180,525 27,070 153,455 183 0% 153,272 Directory services 113,347 (1,239) 1% 114,586 1,264 113,322 (816) 1% 114,138 Other 82,391 (11,525) 12% 93,916 13,908 80,008 (16,197) 17% 96,205 $2,237,018 $ (50,997) 2% $2,288,015 $ 266,608 $ 2,021,407 $ (3,960) 0% $2,025,367 Local Services Local services revenue for 2008 decreased $27.4 million, or 3%, to $848.4 million as compared to 2007. Excluding the additional local services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2008 and 2007, local services revenue for 2008 decreased $47.8 million, or 6%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the continued loss of access lines which accounted for $40.4 million of the decline and a reduction in all other related services of $7.4 million. Enhanced services revenue for 2008, excluding the impact of the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2008 and 2007, decreased $5.6 million, or 3%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decline in access lines and a shift in customers purchasing our unlimited voice communications packages instead of individual features. Rate increases that were effective August 2007 resulted in a favorable 2008 impact of $3.0 million. Local services revenue for 2007 increased $66.2 million, or 8%, to $875.8 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional local services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $95.2 million in 2007, local services revenue for 2007 decreased $29.0 million, or 4%, to $780.6 million as compared to 2006. The loss of access lines accounted for $28.7 million of this decline in local services revenue, partially offset by rate increases in Rochester, New York on residential lines that became effective August 2006 and 2007. Economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our packages and bundles and cause us to increase our promotions and or lower our prices for our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenue, profitability and cash flow. Data and Internet Services Data and internet services revenue for 2008 increased $61.9 million, or 11%, to $605.6 million as compared to 2007. Data and internet services revenue for 2008, excluding the additional data and internet services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2008 and 2007 increased $37.3 million, or 8%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the overall growth in the number of data and High Speed Internet customers. As of December 31, 2008, the number of the Companys High Speed Internet subscribers increased by approximately 57,100, or 11%, since December 31, 2007. Data and internet services also includes revenue from data transmission services to other carriers and high volume commercial customers with dedicated high capacity internet and ethernet circuits. Revenue from these dedicated high capacity circuits, including the impact of $10.5 million attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions, increased $26.9 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. Data and internet services revenue for 2007 increased $119.6 million, or 28%, to $543.8 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional data and internet services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2007, data and internet services revenue for 2007 increased $60.6 million, or 14%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to growth in the number of data and High Speed Internet customers. As of December 31, 2007, the number of the Companys High Speed Internet subscribers increased by approximately 66,700, or 17%, since December 31, 2006. Revenue from dedicated high capacity circuits increased $19.8 million in 2007, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. 31 Access Services Access services revenue for 2008 decreased $74.7 million, or 16%, to $404.7 million as compared to 2007. Excluding the additional access services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2008 and 2007, access services revenue for 2008 decreased $77.3 million, or 19%, as compared to 2007, for our legacy Frontier operations. Switched access revenue for 2008, excluding the unfavorable impact of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, decreased $56.8 million, or 20%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the settlement of a carrier dispute resulting in a favorable impact on our 2007 revenue of $38.7 million (a one time event), and the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, email and other communications services. Excluding the impact of that one time favorable settlement in 2007, our switched access revenue for 2008 declined by $18.1 million, or 7% from 2007. Access services revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies. Subsidy revenue for 2008, excluding the additional subsidy revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions in 2008 and 2007, decreased $20.6 million, or 16%, in 2008 to $104.1 million, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower receipts under the Federal High Cost Fund program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the programs National Average Cost Per Local Loop (NACPL) used by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate funds among all recipients. Subsidy revenue in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $2.5 million in unfavorable adjustments resulting from audits of the Federal High Cost Fund program. Access services revenue for 2007 increased $51.5 million, or 12%, to $479.5 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional access services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $70.2 million in 2007, access services revenue for 2007 decreased $18.7 million, or 4%, as compared to 2006. Switched access revenue of $284.6 million increased $21.2 million, or 8%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to the settlement in the first quarter of 2007 of a dispute with a carrier resulting in a favorable impact on our revenue in 2007 of $38.7 million (a one time event), partially offset by the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses. Subsidy revenue for 2007 of $124.7 million decreased $39.9 million, or 24%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to lower receipts under the Federal High Cost Fund program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the programs NACPL, along with reductions in Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharges due to the elimination of high speed internet units from the USF calculation. Many factors may lead to further increases in the NACPL, thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future. The FCC and state regulators are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies. On May 1, 2008 the FCC issued an order to cap Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Companies (CETC) receipts from the high cost Federal Universal Service Fund. While this order will have no impact on our current receipt levels, we believe this is a positive first step to limit the rapid growth of the fund. The CETC cap will remain in place until the FCC takes additional steps towards needed reform. The FCC is considering proposals that may significantly change interstate, intrastate and local intercarrier compensation and would revise the Federal Universal Service funding and disbursement mechanisms. When and how these proposed changes will be addressed are unknown and, accordingly, we are unable to predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations. However, future reductions in our subsidy and access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have associated variable expenses. Certain states have open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or access revenues. In addition, we have been approached by, and or are involved in formal state proceedings with, various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states. Long Distance Services Long distance services revenue for 2008 increased $2.0 million, or 1%, to $182.6 million as compared to 2007. Excluding the additional long distance services revenue attributable to CTE and GVN acquisitions, long distance services revenue in 2008 decreased $3.8 million, or 2%, as compared to 2007. Generally, our long distance services revenue is trending slightly downward due to a reduction in the overall average revenue per minute of use. During 2008, we actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings. The sale of our digital phone and state unlimited products, and their associated unlimited minutes, has resulted in an increase in long distance customers, and an increase of 10% in the minutes used by these customers. This has lowered our overall average rate per minute billed. Long distance services revenue for 2007 increased $27.3 million, or 18%, to $180.5 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional long distance services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $27.1 million in 2007, long distance services revenue for 2007 was relatively unchanged as compared to 2006, despite an increase of 13% in our long distance minutes of use due to more customers selecting our unlimited minutes of use package. Our long distance minutes of use increased during 2008 and 2007, as compared with the prior years and, as noted below in network access expenses, has increased our cost of services provided. At the same time, average revenue per minute of use has declined. 32 Our long distance services revenue has remained relatively unchanged, but may decrease in the future due to lower rates and or minutes of use. Competing services such as wireless, VOIP and cable telephony are resulting in a loss of customers, minutes of use and further declines in the rates we charge our customers. We expect these factors will continue to adversely affect our long distance revenue in the future. Directory Services Directory services revenue for 2008 decreased $1.2 million, or 1%, to $113.3 million as compared to 2007. Excluding the additional directory services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions in 2008 and 2007, directory services revenue for 2008 decreased $4.0 million, or 4%, as compared to 2007. Directory services revenue in 2008 reflected lower revenues from yellow pages advertising, mainly in Rochester, New York. Directory services revenue for 2007 increased $0.4 million to $114.6 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional directory services revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $1.3 million in 2007, directory services revenue for 2007 decreased $0.8 million, or 1%, as compared to 2006, reflecting slightly lower revenues from yellow pages advertising, mainly in Rochester, New York. Other Other revenue for 2008 decreased $11.5 million, or 12%, to $82.4 million as compared to 2007. Other revenue was impacted by a decrease in equipment sales of $7.0 million, a decrease in service activation fee revenue of $3.3 million and decreased "bill and collect" fee revenue of $3.2 million, partially offset by higher DISH video revenue of $3.3 million. Other revenue for 2007 decreased $2.3 million, or 2%, to $93.9 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional other revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $13.9 million in 2007, other revenue for 2007 decreased $16.2 million, or 17%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in bad debt expense, the impact of a $3.4 million reduction in revenue for our free video promotions with a multi year customer commitment in some of our markets, a decrease in service activation billing of $2.5 million and a decrease of $1.8 million in wireless revenue from the Mohave Cellular Limited Partnership.

Excluding the additional network access expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2008 and 2007, network access expenses decreased $15.1 million, or 8%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. Excluding the additional network access expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $35.8 million in 2007, network access expenses for 2007 increased $21.2 million, or 12%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to increasing rates and usage related to our long distance product and our data backbone. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we expensed $4.2 million of promotional costs for Master Card gift cards issued to new High Speed Internet customers entering into a two year price protection plan and to existing customers who purchased additional services under a two year price protection plan. In the first quarter of 2008, we expensed $2.6 million for a flat screen television promotion. Additionally, in the fourth quarters of 2007 and 2006, we expensed $11.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively, of promotional costs associated with fourth quarter High Speed Internet promotions that subsidized the cost of a new personal computer or a new digital camera in 2007, and a new personal computer in 2006, provided to customers entering into a multi year commitment for certain bundled services. As we continue to increase our sales of data products such as High Speed Internet and expand the availability of our unlimited long distance calling plans, our network access expense may increase in the future. A decline in expenses associated with access line losses, has offset some of the increase.

Consolidated other operating expenses for 2008 increased $2.2 million, to $810.7 million as compared to 2007, primarily the result of our CTE and GVN acquisitions which was largely offset by synergies and cost reductions relating to the legacy Frontier operations. Wage and benefit expenses Wage and benefit expenses for 2008 increased $2.6 million, or 1%, to $383.9 million as compared to 2007. Wage and benefit expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions increased $10.2 million, or 35%, in 2008 versus 2007, primarily due to the pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million recognized in 2007, as discussed below. These additional costs were offset by a decrease of $7.6 million primarily due to headcount reductions and associated decreases in compensation and benefit costs attributable to the integration of the back office, customer service and administrative support functions of the CTE and GVN operations acquired in 2007. Wage and benefit expenses for 2007 increased $22.5 million, or 6%, to $381.3 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional wage and benefit expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $28.9 million in 2007, wage and benefit expenses for 2007 decreased $6.4 million, or 2%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to headcount reductions and associated decreases in compensation and benefit costs. 34 Included in our wage and benefit expenses are pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. The amounts for 2007 include the costs for our CTE plans acquired in 2007 and reflect the positive impact of a pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million, resulting from the freeze placed on certain pension benefits of the former CTE non union employees. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses (which were $11.2 million in 2008), will be approximately $50.0 million to $55.0 million in 2009. No contribution was made to our pension plan during 2008 and none is expected to be made in 2009. Also, effective December 31, 2007, the CTE Employees Pension Plan was merged into the Frontier Pension Plan. As a result of negative investment returns and ongoing benefit payments, the Companys pension plan assets have declined from $822.2 million at December 31, 2007 to $589.8 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $232.4 million, or 28%. This decrease represents a decline in asset value of $162.9 million, or 20%, and benefits paid of $69.5 million, or 8%. The decline in pension plan assets did not impact our results of operations, liquidity or cash flows in 2008. However, we expect that our pension expense will increase in 2009 and that we will be required to make a cash contribution to our pension plan beginning in 2010. Severance and early retirement costs Severance and early retirement costs for 2008 decreased $6.3 million, or 45%, as compared to 2007. Severance and early retirement costs of $7.6 million in 2008 include charges recorded in the first half of 2008 of $3.4 million related to employee early retirements and terminations for 42 Rochester, New York employees. Additional severance costs of $4.0 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, including $1.7 million of enhanced early retirement pension benefits related to 55 employees. Severance and early retirement costs of $13.9 million in 2007 include a third quarter charge of approximately $12.1 million related to initiatives to enhance customer service, streamline operations and reduce costs. Approximately 120 positions were eliminated as part of this 2007 initiative, most of which were filled by new employees at our remaining call centers. In addition, approximately 50 field operations employees agreed to participate in an early retirement program and another 30 employees from a variety of functions left the Company in 2007. Severance and early retirement costs for 2007 increased $6.7 million, or 93%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to the 2007 charge of approximately $12.1 million related to initiatives to enhance customer service, streamline operations and reduce costs, as discussed above. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation for 2008 decreased $1.2 million, or 14%, as compared to 2007 due to reduced costs associated with stock units and stock options. Stock based compensation for 2007 decreased $1.3 million, or 13%, as compared to 2006 due to reduced costs associated with stock options, since fewer stock option grants remained unvested as compared to 2006. All other operating expenses All other operating expenses for 2008 increased $7.2 million, or 2%, to $411.5 million as compared to 2007, primarily due to the additional expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $10.0 million in 2008 versus 2007, as 2008 includes a full year of expenses for CTE and GVN while 2007 included approximately ten months of costs for CTE and two months of costs for GVN. Our purchase of CTE has enabled us to realize cost savings by leveraging our centralized back office, customer service and administrative support functions over a larger customer base. All other operating expenses for 2007 increased $47.5 million, or 13%, to $404.3 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the additional expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $72.1 million in 2007, all other operating expenses for 2007 decreased $24.6 million, or 7%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to the allocation of common corporate costs over a larger base of operations, which now includes CTE. Additionally, our USF contribution rate and PUC fees decreased from 2006, resulting in a reduction in costs of $13.1 million in 2007. An increase in consulting and other outside services of $11.7 million for 2007 offset some of the decrease in expenses noted above. 35 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE 2008 2007 2006 ($ in thousands) Frontier (excluding Amount $ Change % Change Amount Acquisitions CTE and GVN) $ Change % Change Amount Depreciation expense $ 379,490 $ 5,055 1% $ 374,435 $ 45,289 $ 329,146 $(20,961) 6% $ 350,107 Amortization expense 182,311 10,890 6% 171,421 45,042 (1) 126,379 (1) 0% 126,380 $ 561,801 $ 15,945 3% $ 545,856 $ 90,331 $ 455,525 $(20,962) 4% $ 476,487 (1) Represents amortization expense related to the customer base acquired in the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and the Commonwealth trade name. Our assessment of the value of the customer base and trade name, and associated expected useful life, are based upon management estimate and independent appraisal. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2008 increased $15.9 million, or 3%, to $561.8 million as compared to 2007. Excluding the depreciation and amortization expense for 2008 and 2007 attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions, depreciation and amortization expense for 2008 decreased $10.7 million, or 2%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to a declining net asset base for our legacy Frontier properties, partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets is performed annually. We adopted the remaining useful lives proposed in the study effective October 1, 2008. Our "composite depreciation rate" increased from 5.5% to 5.6% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $350.0 million to $370.0 million and amortization expense of $113.9 million for 2009. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for 2007 increased $69.4 million, or 15%, to $545.9 million as compared to 2006 as a result of our 2007 acquisitions of CTE and GVN. Excluding the impact of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, depreciation expense for 2007 decreased $21.0 million, or 6%, as compared to 2006 due to a declining net asset base partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. INVESTMENT INCOME/OTHER INCOME (LOSS), NET / INTEREST EXPENSE / INCOME TAX EXPENSE 2008 2007 2006 ($ in thousands) Frontier (excluding Amount $ Change % Change Amount Acquisitions CTE and GVN) $ Change % Change Amount Investment income $ 14,504 $ (21,277) 59% $ 35,781 $ 402 $ 35,379 $ (44,057) 55% $ 79,436 Other income (loss), net $ (5,170) $ 12,663 71% $ (17,833) $ 4,978 $ (22,811) $ (25,818) 859% $ 3,007 Interest expense $ 362,634 $ (18,062) 5% $ 380,696 $ (260) $ 380,956 $ 44,510 13% $ 336,446 Income tax expense $ 106,496 $ (21,518) 17% $ 128,014 $ 27,013 $ 101,001 $ (35,478) 26% $ 136,479 Investment Income Investment income for 2008 decreased $21.3 million, or 59%, to $14.5 million as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease of $22.1 million in income from short term investments of cash and cash equivalents due to a lower investable cash balance. Investment income for 2007 decreased $43.7 million, or 55%, to $35.8 million as compared to 2006. Excluding the investment income attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $0.4 million, investment income for 2007 decreased $44.1 million, or 55%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to the $64.6 million in proceeds received in 2006 from the RTB liquidation and dissolution, partially offset by an increase of $10.8 million in income from short term investments of cash and lower minority interest in joint ventures of $2.3 million. We borrowed $550.0 million in December 2006 in anticipation of the Commonwealth acquisition in 2007. Our average cash balances were $177.5 million, $594.2 million and $429.5 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other Income (Loss), net Other income (loss), net for 2008 improved $12.7 million, or 71%, to $(5.2) million as compared to 2007. Other income (loss), net improved in 2008 primarily due to a reduction in the loss on retirement of debt of $11.9 million and the $4.1 million expense of a bridge loan fee recorded during the first quarter of 2007. Other income (loss), net for 2007 decreased $20.8 million to ($17.8) million as compared to 2006. Excluding the other income attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $5.0 million, other income (loss), net for 2007 decreased $25.8 million to ($22.8) million as compared to 2006, primarily due to the premium paid of $18.2 million on the early retirement of debt during 2007 and a bridge loan fee of $4.1 million. 36 Interest Expense Interest expense for 2008 decreased $18.1 million, or 5%, to $362.6 million as compared to 2007, primarily due to the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements and retirement of related debt during the first quarter of 2008, along with slightly lower average debt levels and average interest rates. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007 was 40 basis points lower, decreasing from 7.94% to 7.54%. Interest expense for 2007 increased $44.5 million, or 13%, to $381.0 million as compared to 2006, primarily due to $637.6 million of higher average debt in 2007 resulting from financing the CTE acquisition. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2007, as compared with our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2006 was 18 basis points lower, decreasing from 8.12% to 7.94%. Our average debt outstanding was $4,753.0 million, $4,834.5 million and $4,196.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for 2008 decreased $21.5 million, or 17%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower taxable income and the reduction in income tax expense of $7.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 2008 that resulted from the expiration of certain statute of limitations on April 15, 2008, as discussed below. The effective tax rate for 2008 was 36.8% as compared with 37.4% for 2007. The Companys effective tax rate decreased in 2008 mainly due to the impact of the favorable tax reserve adjustment recorded in the second quarter of 2008. We paid $78.9 million in cash taxes during 2008, an increase of $24.5 million over 2007, reflecting the utilization of our tax loss carryforwards in prior years. We expect to pay approximately $90.0 million to $110.0 million in 2009. Our 2009 cash tax estimate reflects the anticipated favorable impact of bonus depreciation that is part of the economic stimulus package signed into law by President Obama. As a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on April 15, 2008, the liabilities on our books as of December 31, 2007 related to uncertain tax positions recorded under FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 were reduced by $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2008. This reduction lowered income tax expense by $7.5 million, goodwill by $3.0 million and deferred income tax assets by $5.7 million during the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the income tax expense attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $27.0 million, income tax expense for 2007 decreased $35.5 million, or 26%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to changes in taxable income. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was 37.4% as compared with an effective tax rate of 34.9% for 2006. The Companys effective tax rate increased in 2007 mainly due to changes in permanent difference items and tax contingencies. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ($ in thousands) 2006 Amount Revenue $ 100,612 Operating income $ 27,882 Income taxes $ 11,583 Net income $ 18,912 Gain on disposal of ELI, net of tax $ 71,635 On July 31, 2006, we sold our CLEC business, Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI) for $255.3 million (including a later sale of associated real estate) in cash plus the assumption of approximately $4.0 million in capital lease obligations. We recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of ELI of approximately $116.7 million. Our after tax gain on the sale was $71.6 million. Our cash liability for taxes as a result of the sale was approximately $5.0 million due to the utilization of existing tax net operating losses on both the Federal and state level. 37 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio. Our long term debt as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 94% fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes after the termination of our remaining interest rate swap agreements on January 15, 2008. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, all but $281.0 million of our borrowings at December 31, 2008 have fixed interest rates. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2008, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our Senior Notes due in 2011 and 2013. Cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million were received in January 2008. The related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet, and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately $3.7 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 7.54% and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. There has been no material change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since December 31, 2007. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of December 31, 2008 is limited to our pension assets. We have no other security investments of any material amount. During 2008, the diminished availability of credit and liquidity in the United States and throughout the global financial system has resulted in substantial volatility in financial markets and the banking system. These and other economic events have had an adverse impact on investment portfolios. As a result of negative investment returns and ongoing benefit payments, the Companys pension plan assets have declined from $822.2 million at December 31, 2007 to $589.8 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $232.4 million, or 28%. This decrease represents a decline in asset value of $162.9 million, or 20%, and benefits paid of $69.5 million, or 8%. The decline in pension plan assets did not impact our results of operations, liquidity or cash flows in 2008. However, we expect that our pension expense will increase in 2009 and that we may be required to make a cash contribution to our pension plan beginning in 2010. 38
