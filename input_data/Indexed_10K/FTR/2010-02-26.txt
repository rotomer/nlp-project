Risk Factors above, in evaluating any statement in this report on Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. Overview We are a fullservice communications provider and one of the largest exchange telephone carriers in the country. As of December 31, 2009, we operated in 24 states with approximately 5,400 employees. On May 13, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with Verizon under which Frontier will acquire defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of Verizon in the Spinco territory, including Internet access and long distance services and broadband video provided to designated customers in the Spinco territory. Assuming that the merger occurred on December 31, 2009, the merger would have resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 4.2 million access lines and certain business related assets from Verizon. The Verizon Transaction will be financed with approximately $5.3 billion of common stock plus the assumption of approximately $3.33 billion in debt. Certain of the conditions to the closing of the Verizon Transaction have already been met: (1) Frontiers shareholders approved the Verizon Transaction at a special meeting of shareholders held on October 27, 2009; (2) the Federal Trade Commission has granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act; (3) approvals of all necessary local video franchise authorities (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions); (4) receipt by Verizon of a favorable ruling from the IRS regarding the tax consequences of the Verizon Transaction; and (5) five of the nine required state regulatory approvals. Completion of the Verizon Transaction remains subject to a number of other conditions, including the receipt of the remaining four state regulatory approvals, approval from the FCC, the completion of financing on terms that satisfy certain conditions as well as other customary closing conditions. Subject to satisfaction of these conditions, we anticipate closing this transaction during the second quarter of 2010. During 2007, we completed the acquisitions of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, Inc. (Commonwealth or CTE), and Global Valley Networks, Inc. and GVN Services (together GVN) which expanded our presence in Pennsylvania and California, and strengthened our position as a leading full service communications provider to rural markets. Our revenues declined in 2009. Revenues from data and internet services such as HSI grew and increased as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from local access lines and access charges (including federal and state subsidies) declined and decreased as a percentage of our total revenues. Regulatory revenue includes switched access and subsidy revenue and represents 17% of our revenues in 2009. Switched access revenue was $246.3 million in 2009, or 12% of our revenues, down from $284.9 million in 2008, or 13% of our revenues. Federal and state subsidy revenue, including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to the FCC, was $113.3 million in 2009, or 5% of our revenues, down from $119.8 million in 2008, or 5% of our revenues. We expect these revenue trends in switched access and subsidy revenue to continue in 2010. Competition in the communications industry is intense and increasing. We experience competition from many communications service providers. These providers include cable operators offering video, data, and VOIP products, wireless carriers, long distance providers, competitive local exchange carriers, Internet providers and other wireline carriers. We believe that as of December 31, 2009, approximately 73% of the households in our territories had VOIP as an available service option. We also believe that competition will continue in 2010 and may result in reduced revenues. 32 The lingering impact of the severe contraction in the global financial markets that occurred in 2008 and 2009 and the subsequent recession has impacted residential and business customer behavior to reduce expenditures by not purchasing our services or by discontinuing some or all of our services. These trends may continue and may result in a continued challenging revenue environment. These factors could also result in increased delinquencies and bankruptcies and, therefore, affect our ability to collect money owed to us by residential and business customers. We employ a number of strategies to combat the competitive pressures and changes in consumer behavior noted above. Our strategies are focused on preserving and generating new revenues through customer retention, upgrading and up selling services to our existing customer base, new customer growth, win backs of former customers, new product deployment, and upon managing our profitability and cash flow through targeted reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures. We seek to achieve our customer retention goals by offering attractive packages of value added services to our access line customers and providing exemplary customer service. Bundled services include HSI, unlimited long distance calling, enhanced telephone features and video offerings. We tailor these services to the needs of our residential and business customers and continually evaluate the introduction of new and complementary products and services, many of which can also be purchased separately. Customer retention is also enhanced by offering one , two and three year price protection plans where customers commit to a term in exchange for predictable pricing and or promotional offers. Additionally, we are focused on enhancing the customer experience as we believe exceptional customer service will differentiate us from our competition. Our commitment to providing exemplary customer service is demonstrated by our expanded customer service hours, shorter scheduling windows for in home appointments and the previously implemented call reminders and follow up calls for service appointments. In addition, our 70 local area markets are operated by local managers with responsibility for the customer experience, as well as the financial results, in those markets. Customers in our markets have direct access to those local managers to help them manage their communications needs. We utilize targeted and innovative promotions like aspirational gifts (e.g., personal computers) or promotional credits to attract new customers, including those moving into our territory, to win back former customers and to upgrade and up sell existing customers a variety of service offerings including HSI, video, and enhanced long distance and feature packages in order to maximize the average revenue per customer (wallet share) paid to us. Depending upon market and economic conditions, we may offer such promotions to drive sales in the future. We have restructured and augmented our sales distribution channels to improve coverage of all segments of the business customer base. This includes adding new sales teams dedicated to small business customers and enhancing the business selling and support skills in our customer sales and service centers. We have also increased our focus on customer premise equipment (CPE) sales for customers requiring an equipment solution, and have extended our CPE sales reach beyond a handful of markets. In addition, we are introducing new products utilizing wireless and Internet technologies. We believe the combination of new products and distribution channel improvements will help us improve business customer acquisition and retention. We are also focused on increasing sales of newer products, including unlimited long distance minutes, bundles of long distance minutes, wireless data, Internet portal advertising, and the Frontier Peace of Mind product suite. This last category is a suite of products that is aimed at managing the total communications and personal computing experience for our customers and designed to provide value and simplicity to meet our customers ever changing needs. The Frontier Peace of Mind products and services suite includes services such as an in home, full installation of our HSI product, two hour appointment windows for the installation, hard drive back up services, 24 7 help desk PC support and inside wire maintenance (when bundled). In 2009, the Frontier Peace of Mind products generated approximately $3.2 million in revenue. Most recently, we introduced our myfitv.com website which provides easy online access to video content, entertainment and news available on the worldwide web. Our hard drive back up services, 24 7 help desk PC support and myfitv.com services are also available outside of our service territories. Although we are optimistic about the opportunities provided by each of these initiatives to increase revenue and reduce churn, we can provide no assurance about their long term profitability or impact on revenue. We believe that the combination of offering multiple products and services to our customers pursuant to price protection programs, billing them on a single bill, providing superior customer service, and being active in our local communities will make our customers more loyal, and will help us generate new, and retain existing, customer revenue. 33 (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $358.7 million. Our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we used cash flow from operations, new borrowings and cash on hand to fund all of our investing and financing activities, including debt repayments. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt payments, pay taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy, pay our acquisition and integration costs and capital expenditures, and support our short term and long term operating strategies through 2010. However, a number of factors, including but not limited to, losses of access lines, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated by operations. In addition, although we believe, based on information available to us, that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us, given the current economic environment and the recent severe contraction in the global financial markets, this could change in the future. Further, the current credit market turmoil and our below investment grade credit ratings may also make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt. As of December 31, 2009, we have approximately $7.2 million and $280.0 million of debt maturing in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The consummation of the Verizon Transaction would result in a combined company with significantly larger business operations and, consequently, greater working capital, capital expenditure and other liquidity needs. Upon consummation of the Verizon Transaction, we will be assuming approximately $3.4 billion of Spinco debt. As a result of the greater liquidity requirements of the combined company, it is anticipated that we will seek to expand our revolving credit facility in order to ensure that the combined company has sufficient flexibility to meet its liquidity needs. In addition, the Company may need or elect to raise capital in order to finance or pre fund commitments which may be made to governmental agencies in connection with their approval of the Verizon Transaction, including commitments with regard to capital expenditures. In addition, if Spinco (with Frontiers consent and participation) chooses to raise all or a portion of the financing required to complete the Verizon Transaction prior to the closing of the Verizon Transaction, and the Verizon Transaction is ultimately not consummated or is delayed for a significant period of time, we could be obligated to pay significant interest expense and other costs in connection with the financing without ever achieving the expected benefits of the Verizon Transaction, which may impact our liquidity. Assuming the Verizon Transaction closes, based on the lower level of Spinco debt we will be assuming from Spinco relative to Spincos projected operating cash flows, the combined companys overall debt will increase but its capacity to service the debt will be significantly enhanced as compared to Frontiers capacity today. At December 31, 2009, the ratio of Frontiers net debt to 2009 operating cash flow (leverage ratio) was 3.9 times. It is expected that the combined companys leverage ratio will be significantly lower at closing. Cash Flow provided by Operating Activities Cash flow provided by operating activities improved $3.5 million for 2009 as compared to 2008. Cash flow provided by operating activities declined $82.4 million, or 10%, for 2008 as compared to 2007. The decline resulted from a drop in operating income, as adjusted for non cash items, lower investment income, a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in current income tax expenditures. These declines were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable that positively impacted our cash position as compared to the prior year. We paid $78.9 million in cash taxes during 2008. 34 Cash paid for taxes was $59.7 million, $78.9 million and $54.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our 2009 cash taxes were lower than 2008 and reflect the benefits from accelerated tax depreciation arising from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), utilization of AMT credits and higher interest expense arising from our debt offerings not fully offset by debt repurchases. We expect that in 2010 our cash taxes will be less than $10.0 million. We expect that our 2010 cash taxes will be reduced by the receipt of tax refunds arising from the retroactive application of a change in tax accounting for repairs and maintenance costs. In addition, our 2010 cash taxes will be impacted by approximately $60.0 million of tax benefits arising from our integration activities and secondarily, our 2009 debt refinancing activities. Absent the tax benefits generated by these integration and refinancing activities, we estimate that cash taxes would be approximately $60.0 million to $70.0 million in 2010. In connection with the pending Verizon Transaction, the Company commenced activities during 2009 to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, plan and implement systems conversions and begin other initiatives necessary to effectuate the closing, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2010, and enable the combined company to implement its go to market strategy at closing. As a result, the Company incurred $28.3 million of acquisition and integration costs and $25.0 million in capital expenditures related to Verizon integration activities in 2009. While the Company continues to evaluate certain other expenses, we currently expect to incur operating expenses and capital expenditures of approximately $100.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively, in 2010 related to these integration activities. Cash Flow used by Investing Activities Acquisitions On March 8, 2007, we acquired Commonwealth in a cash and stock taxable transaction, for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. We paid $804.1 million in cash ($663.7 million net, after cash acquired) and issued our common stock with a value of approximately $249.8 million. In connection with the acquisition of Commonwealth, we assumed $35.0 million of debt under a revolving credit facility and $191.8 million face amount of Commonwealth convertible notes (fair value of $209.6 million). During March 2007, we paid down in full the $35.0 million credit facility. We retired all of the Commonwealth notes as of December 31, 2008. On October 31, 2007, we acquired GVN for a total cash consideration of $62.0 million. Capital Expenditures In 2009, 2008 and 2007, our capital expenditures were $256.0 million (including $25.0 million of Verizon integration related capital expenditures), $288.3 million and $315.8 million, respectively. We continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $220.0 million to $240.0 million for 2010 related to our currently owned properties, and an additional $75.0 million of capital expenditures related to the integration activities of the pending Verizon Transaction. Cash Flow used by and provided from Financing Activities Issuance of Debt Securities On October 1, 2009, we completed a registered debt offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2018. The issue price was 98.441% of the principal amount of the notes, and we received net proceeds of approximately $578.7 million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand (including cash proceeds from our April 2009 debt offering described below), to finance a cash tender offer for our outstanding 9.250% Senior Notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and our outstanding 6.250% Senior Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes), as described below. On April 9, 2009, we completed a registered offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. The issue price was 91.805% of the principal amount of the notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $538.8 million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase outstanding debt, as described below. 35 On March 28, 2008, we borrowed $135.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan facility that was established on March 10, 2008. The loan matures in 2013 and bears interest based on the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our election, plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio. We used the proceeds to repurchase, during the first quarter of 2008, $128.7 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes and to pay for the $6.3 million of premium on early retirement of those notes. On March 23, 2007, we issued in a private placement an aggregate $300.0 million principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2015 and $450.0 million principal amount of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2019. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down in full $200.0 million principal amount of indebtedness borrowed on March 8, 2007 under a bridge loan facility in connection with the acquisition of Commonwealth, and to redeem, on April 26, 2007, $495.2 million principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2008. In the second quarter of 2007, we completed an exchange offer (to publicly register the debt) for the $750.0 million in total of private placement notes described above, in addition to the $400.0 million principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2027 issued in a private placement on December 22, 2006, for registered notes. Debt Reduction In 2009, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $1,048.3 million of debt, consisting of $1,047.3 million of senior unsecured debt, as described in more detail below, and $1.0 million of rural utilities service loan contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company purchased and retired, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer referred to above, approximately $564.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes and approximately $83.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes. The aggregate consideration for these debt repurchases was $701.6 million, which was financed with the proceeds of the October 2009 debt offering and a portion of the proceeds of the April 2009 debt offering, each as described above. The repurchases in the tender offer resulted in a loss on the early retirement of debt of approximately $53.7 million, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition to the debt tender offer, we used $388.9 million of the April 2009 debt offering proceeds to repurchase in 2009 $396.7 million principal amount of debt, consisting of $280.8 million of the 2011 Notes, $54.1 million of our 7.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2027, $35.9 million of the 2013 Notes, $16.0 million of our 7.125% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 and $9.9 million of our 6.80% Debentures due August 15, 2026. An additional $7.8 million net gain was recognized and included in Other income (loss), net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of these other debt repurchases. As a result of these 2009 debt transactions described above, as of December 31, 2009, we had reduced our debt maturities through 2013 to approximately $7.2 million maturing in 2010, $280.0 million maturing in 2011, $180.4 million maturing in 2012 and $709.9 million maturing in 2013. We do not expect the Verizon Transaction to change the amount of these near term debt maturities. In 2008, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $144.7 million of debt, consisting of $128.7 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes, $12.0 million of other senior unsecured debt and rural utilities service loan contracts, and $4.0 million of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities (EPPICS). In 2007, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $967.2 million of debt, including $3.3 million of EPPICS, and $17.8 million of 3.25% Commonwealth convertible notes that were converted into our common stock. On April 26, 2007, we redeemed $495.2 million principal amount of our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2008 at a price of 103.041% plus accrued and unpaid interest. During the first quarter of 2007, we borrowed and repaid $200.0 million utilized to temporarily fund the acquisition of Commonwealth, and we paid down in full the $35.0 million Commonwealth credit facility. Through December 31, 2007, we retired $183.3 million face amount of Commonwealth convertible notes for which we paid $165.4 million in cash and $36.7 million in common stock. We also paid down $44.6 million of industrial development revenue bonds and $4.3 million of rural utilities service loan contracts. We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market, through tender offers, exchanges of debt securities, by exercising rights to call or in privately negotiated transactions. We may also refinance existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations. 36 EPPICS As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, there was no EPPICS related debt outstanding to third parties. The following disclosure provides the history regarding this issuance. In 1996, our consolidated wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Trust (the Trust), issued, in an underwritten public offering, 4,025,000 shares of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 (Trust Convertible Preferred Securities or EPPICS), representing preferred undivided interests in the assets of the Trust, with a liquidation preference of $50 per security (for a total liquidation amount of $201.3 million). These securities had an adjusted conversion price of $11.46 per share of our common stock. The conversion price was reduced from $13.30 to $11.46 during the third quarter of 2004 as a result of the $2.00 per share of common stock special, non recurring dividend. The proceeds from the issuance of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase $207.5 million aggregate liquidation amount of 5% Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities due 2036 from another wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Citizens Utilities Capital L.P. (the Partnership). The proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities and a Company capital contribution were used to purchase from us $211.8 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2036. The sole assets of the Trust were the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities, and our Convertible Subordinated Debentures were substantially all the assets of the Partnership. Our obligations under the agreements relating to the issuances of such securities, taken together, constituted a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trusts obligations relating to the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities and the Partnerships obligations relating to the Partnership Convertible Preferred Securities. In accordance with the terms of the issuances, we paid the annual 5% interest in quarterly installments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures in 2008 and 2007. Cash was paid (net of investment returns) to the Partnership in payment of the interest on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The cash was then distributed by the Partnership to the Trust and then by the Trust to the holders of the EPPICS. As of December 31, 2008, EPPICS representing the total aggregate liquidation preference of $197.8 million have been converted into 15,969,645 shares of our common stock. There were no outstanding EPPICS as of December 31, 2008 and 2009. As a result of the redemption of all outstanding EPPICS as of December 31, 2008, the $10.5 million in debt with related parties was reclassified by the Company against an offsetting investment. Interest Rate Management On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes. Cash proceeds from the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million were received in January 2008. The related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet, and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt. We recognized $7.6 million and $5.0 million of deferred gain during 2009 and 2008, respectively, and anticipate recognizing an additional $1.0 million of deferred gain during 2010. For 2007, the interest expense resulting from these interest rate swaps totaled approximately $2.4 million. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not have any derivative instruments. Credit Facility As of December 31, 2009, we had an available line of credit under our revolving credit facility with seven financial institutions in the aggregate amount of $250.0 million and there were no outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the facility. Associated facility fees vary, depending on our debt leverage ratio, and were 0.225% per annum as of December 31, 2009. The expiration date for this $250.0 million five year revolving credit agreement is May 18, 2012. During the term of the credit facility we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds subject to customary borrowing conditions. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments. 37 Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures and credit facility agreements include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with U.S. GAAP, restrictions on liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We currently have no restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract, rule or regulation, other than those imposed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. However, we would be restricted under our credit facilities from declaring dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time or will result from the dividend declaration. Our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), which matures in 2011, our $250.0 million credit facility, and our $150.0 million and $135.0 million senior unsecured term loans, each contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under those covenants, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.50 to 1. Our credit facilities and certain indentures for our senior unsecured debt obligations limit our ability to create liens or merge or consolidate with other companies and our subsidiaries ability to borrow funds, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities We receive proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of options pursuant to our stock based compensation plans. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we received approximately $0.8 million, $1.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively, upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. Share Repurchase Programs There were no shares repurchased during 2009 under a share repurchase program. During 2008, we repurchased 17,778,300 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $200.0 million. During 2007, we repurchased 17,279,600 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $250.0 million. Dividends We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends. Our ability to fund a regular quarterly dividend will be impacted by our ability to generate cash from operations. The declarations and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We have announced that after the closing of the Verizon Transaction we intend to reduce our annual cash dividend from $1.00 per share to $0.75 per share, subject to applicable law and within the discretion of our Board of Directors, as discussed above. Until consummation of the Verizon Transaction or termination of the merger agreement, we are also restricted from increasing the amount of our dividends by the terms of our merger agreement with Verizon. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. 38 Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009 is as follows: Contractual Obligations: ($ in thousands) Payment due by period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long term debt obligations, excluding interest $ 4,884,151 $ 7,236 $ 460,322 $ 1,310,372 $ 3,106,221 Interest on long term debt 4,593,546 362,308 703,055 592,803 2,935,380 Operating lease obligations 64,288 24,417 20,034 12,903 6,934 Purchase obligations 30,269 11,026 10,828 8,250 165 Liability for uncertain tax positions 56,860 3,454 45,538 7,587 281 Total $ 9,629,114 $ 408,441 $ 1,239,777 $ 1,931,915 $ 6,048,981 At December 31, 2009, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $27.7 million. Divestitures On August 24, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a plan to divest our public utilities services businesses, which included gas, electric and water and wastewater businesses. We have sold all of these properties. In 2006, we disposed of ELI, our former CLEC business. All of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities (typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale), including environmental liabilities, for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement (see Note 21). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, contingencies and purchase price allocations, among others. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of collectability of our accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts. In 2009 and 2008, we had no critical estimates related to telecommunications bankruptcies. Asset Impairment In 2009 and 2008, we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments. 39 Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. We reorganized our management and operating structure during the first quarter of 2009 to include our Rochester market with our existing New York State properties and the rest of the East Region. This structure is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Makers (CEO, CFO, COO) review our results on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. As a result of the change, our operating segments (reporting units) decreased from 4 (at December 31, 2008) to 3 (effective as of March 31, 2009). After making the change in our operating segments, we reviewed our goodwill impairment test by comparing the EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit to their carrying values noting that no impairment indicator was present. Further, we determined that no impairment was indicated at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 for either the East or Rochester reporting units and combining them did not alter the conclusion at either date. No potential impairment was indicated and no further analysis was deemed necessary. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, we aggregate our three operating segments into one reportable segment. In determining fair value of goodwill during 2009 we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ILEC properties as well as trading values of our publicly traded common stock. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. Our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of December 31, 2009. Goodwill by reporting unit (operating segment) at December 31, 2009 is as follows: Reporting Units ($ in thousands) East West Central Goodwill $ 1,201,387 $ 34,736 $ 1,406,200 We did not have any changes to our operating segments, reporting units, or changes in the allocation of goodwill by reporting unit during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008. During the first quarter of 2007 we acquired Commonwealth and included their operations and any related goodwill in our Central region. 40 Each of the above noted reporting units is an operating segment. The first step in the goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit to its fair value. The result of this first step indicated that fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units by a wide margin. As a result, the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required. We estimate fair value in two ways: (1) market or transaction based and (2) equity based utilizing our share price. Market values for rural ILEC properties are typically quoted as a multiple of cash flow or EBITDA. Marketplace transactions and analyst reports support a range of values around a multiple of 6 to 6.5 times annualized EBITDA. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test we define EBITDA as operating income plus depreciation and amortization. We determined the fair value estimates using 6 times EBITDA but also used lower EBITDA multiples to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess of fair value over the carrying values of the reporting units. Additionally, a second test was performed using our public market equity value or market capitalization. Market capitalization (current market stock price times total shares outstanding) is a public market indicator of equity value and is useful in corroborating the 6 times EBITDA valuation because we are singularly engaged in rural ILEC operating activities. Our stock price on December 31, 2009 was $7.81 and when compared to the fair value using the EBITDA multiple obtained above, exceeded such value before consideration of any applicable control premium. We also used lower per share stock prices to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess fair value over the carrying value. Total market capitalization determined in this manner is then allocated to the reporting units based upon each units relative share of consolidated EBITDA. Our method of determining fair value has been consistently applied for the three years ending December 31, 2009. Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment assets is performed annually. We adopted the lives proposed in the study effective October 1, 2009. Our composite depreciation rate decreased from 5.6% to 5.2% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $335.0 million to $355.0 million for 2010 related to our currently owned properties. We periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates. We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The pension plans for the majority of our current employees are frozen. All of the employees who are still accruing pension benefits are represented employees. The accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. The discount rate is used to value, on a present value basis, our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term, high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve, the Citigroup Above Median Pension Curve, the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. Our discount rate was 5.75% at year end 2009, and 6.50% at year end 2008. 41 The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 35% to 55% in fixed income securities, 35% to 55% in equity securities and 5% to 15% in alternative investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year. In 2009, we changed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to 8.0% from the 8.25% used in 2008. For 2010, we will assume a rate of return of 8.00%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date. We expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for 2010 will be $45.0 million to $55.0 million (they were $48.6 million in 2009), and that we will make a $10.0 million cash contribution to our pension plan in 2010. No contributions were made to our pension plan during 2007, 2008 or 2009. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were approximately at the statutory rates. Contingencies At December 31, 2006, we had a reserve of $8.0 million in connection with a potential environmental claim in Bangor, Maine. This claim was settled with a payment of $7.625 million plus additional expenses during the third quarter of 2007. We currently do not have any contingencies in excess of $5.0 million recorded on our books. Purchase Price Allocation Commonwealth and GVN The allocation of the approximate $1.1 billion paid to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities of Commonwealth is a critical estimate. We finalized our estimate of the fair values assigned to plant, customer list and goodwill, as more fully described in Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the estimated expected life of a customer (used to amortize the customer list) is a critical estimate. New Accounting Pronouncements The following new accounting standards were adopted by the Company in 2009 without any material financial statement impact. All of these standards are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157, ASC Topic 820), as amended Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R, ASC Topic 805), as amended Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160, ASC Topic 810) Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities (FSP EITF No. 03 6 1, ASC Topic 260) Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165, ASC Topic 855) The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 168, ASC Topic 105) Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP SFAS No. 132(R) 1, ASC Topic 715) 42 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (b) Results of Operations Our historical results include the results of operations of CTE from the date of its acquisition on March 8, 2007 and of GVN from the date of its acquisition on October 31, 2007. Accordingly, results of operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are not directly comparable as 2009 and 2008 results reflect the inclusion of a full year of operations of CTE and GVN, whereas 2007 results reflect the inclusion of approximately ten months of operations of CTE and of two months of operations of GVN. REVENUE Revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance, and data and internet services. Such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. Consolidated revenue for 2009 decreased $119.1 million, or 5%, to $2,117.9 million as compared to 2008. This decline is a result of lower local services revenue, switched access revenue, long distance services revenue and subsidy revenue, partially offset by a $31.3 million, or 5%, increase in data and internet services revenue, each as described in more detail below. Consolidated revenue for 2008 decreased $51.0 million, or 2%, to $2,237.0 million as compared to 2007. Excluding additional revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions for a full year in 2008 and for a partial period in 2007, our revenue decreased $107.3 million during 2008, or 5%, as compared to 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, we had a significant favorable settlement of a carrier dispute that resulted in a favorable one time impact to our revenue of $38.7 million. Excluding the additional revenue due to the one time favorable settlement in the first quarter of 2007 and the additional revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions in 2008 and 2007, our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined $68.6 million, or 3%, as compared to the prior year. This decline is a result of lower local services revenue, switched access revenue and subsidy revenue, partially offset by a $37.3 million, or 8%, increase in data and internet services revenue, each as described in more detail below. Change in the number of our access lines is one factor that is important to our revenue and profitability. We have lost access lines primarily because of changing consumer behavior (including wireless substitution), economic conditions, changing technology, competition, and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add HSI or cable modem service. In 2009, we lost approximately 136,800 access lines (net), or 6% on an annual basis. This represents an improvement in our rate of access line loss over 2008, during which we lost approximately 174,800 access lines (net) or 7% on an annual basis. We believe this improvement is attributable to the customer recognition of the value of our product bundles, fewer residential moves out of territory, fewer moves by businesses to competitors and our ability to compete with cable telephony in a maturing marketplace. Economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our bundles, and cause us to increase our promotions and or lower our prices for our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenue, profitability and cash flow. During 2009, we added approximately 56,000 HSI subscribers. We expect to continue to increase HSI subscribers in 2010 (although not enough to offset the expected continued loss in access lines). While the number of access lines is an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends, it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate our business. Management believes that customer counts and understanding different components of revenue is most important. For this reason, presented in the table titled Other Financial and Operating Data below is a breakdown that presents residential customer counts, average monthly revenue, percentage of customers on price protection plans and churn. It also categorizes revenue into customer revenue (residential and business) and regulatory revenue (switched access and subsidy revenue). Despite the 7% decline in residential customers and the 6% decline in total access lines, our customer revenue, which is all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue, declined in 2009 by 4 percent as compared to the prior year period. The average monthly residential and total customer revenue per customer has improved, and resulted in an increased wallet share. A substantial further loss of customers and access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue, profitability and cash flows to decrease in 2010. 43 OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA As of % Increase As of % Increase As of December 31, 2009 (Decrease) December 31, 2008 (Decrease) December 31, 2007 Access lines: Residential 1,349,510 (7 %) 1,454,268 (8 %) 1,587,930 Business 768,002 (4 %) 800,065 (5 %) 841,212 Total access lines 2,117,512 (6 %) 2,254,333 (7 %) 2,429,142 High Speed Internet subscribers 635,947 10 % 579,943 11 % 522,845 Video subscribers 172,961 44 % 119,919 28 % 93,596 For the year ended December 31, $ Increase % Increase $ Increase % Increase 2009 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2007 Revenue (in 000s): Residential $ 899,800 $ (49,484 ) (5 %) $ 949,284 $ (9,169 ) (1 %) $ 958,453 Business 858,460 (24,561 ) (3 %) 883,021 32,921 4 % 850,100 Total customer revenue 1,758,260 (74,045 ) (4 %) 1,832,305 23,752 1 % 1,808,553 Regulatory (Access Services) 359,634 (45,079 ) (11 %) 404,713 (74,749 ) (16 %) 479,462 Total revenue $ 2,117,894 $ (119,124 ) (5 %) $ 2,237,018 $ (50,997 ) (2 %) $ 2,288,015 Switched access minutes of use (in millions) 8,854 (12 %) 10,027 (5 %) 10,592 Average monthly total revenue per access line $ 80.74 1 % $ 79.62 2 % $ 77.72 (1) Average monthly customer revenue per access line $ 67.03 3 % $ 65.22 4 % $ 62.49 As of As of December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Residential Customer Metrics: Customers 1,254,508 (7 %) 1,347,423 Revenue (in 000s) $ 899,800 (5 %) $ 949,284 Average Monthly Residential Customer Revenue per Customer $ 57.62 2 % $ 56.42 Percent of Customers on Price Protection Plans 53.2 % 19 % 44.6 % Customer Monthly Churn 1.47 % (6 %) 1.57 % Products per Residential Customer (2) 2.54 7 % 2.37 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2007, the calculation includes CTE and GVN data and excludes the $38.7 million favorable one time impact from the first quarter 2007 settlement of a switched access dispute.

Enhanced services revenue in 2009 decreased $14.7 million, as compared with 2008, primarily due to a decline in access lines and a shift in customers purchasing our unlimited voice communications packages with features included in the bundle instead of purchasing individual features. Local services revenue for 2008 decreased $27.4 million, or 3%, to $848.4 million as compared to 2007. Local services revenue for 2008 increased $20.4 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and legacy Frontier operations decreased $47.8 million, or 6%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the continued loss of access lines which accounted for $40.4 million of the decline and a reduction in all other related services of $7.4 million. Enhanced services revenue for 2008, excluding the impact of the CTE and GVN acquisitions for 2008 and 2007, decreased $5.6 million, or 3%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decline in access lines and a shift in customers purchasing our unlimited voice communications packages instead of individual features. Rate increases that were effective August 2007 resulted in a favorable 2008 impact of $3.0 million. Data and Internet Services Data and internet services revenue for 2009 increased $31.3 million, or 5%, to $636.9 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to the overall growth in the number of HSI subscribers and high capacity internet and ethernet circuits purchased by customers. As of December 31, 2009, the number of the Companys HSI subscribers had increased by approximately 56,000, or 10%, since December 31, 2008. We have used aspirational gifts or promotional credits to drive growth in HSI subscribers. Data and internet services also includes revenue from data transmission services to other carriers and high volume commercial customers with dedicated high capacity Internet and ethernet circuits. Revenue from these dedicated high capacity circuits increased $7.3 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. Data and internet services revenue for 2008 increased $61.9 million, or 11%, to $605.6 million as compared to 2007. Data and internet services revenue for 2008 increased $24.6 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and legacy Frontier operations increased $37.3 million, or 8%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the overall growth in the number of HSI subscribers. As of December 31, 2008, the number of the Companys HSI subscribers increased by approximately 57,100, or 11%, since December 31, 2007. Revenue from dedicated high capacity circuits, including the impact of $10.5 million attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions, increased $26.9 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. In February 2009, the President signed into law an economic stimulus package, ARRA, that includes $7.2 billion in funding, through grants and loans, for new broadband investment and adoption in unserved and underserved communities. We filed applications for the first round of stimulus funding in West Virginia, but were notified in February 2010 that we were not selected. The federal agencies responsible for administering the programs released rules and evaluation criteria for the second round of funding, with applications due by March 15, 2010. The Company will evaluate opportunities but has not made a decision on whether it will apply for any funding in this round. 45 Access Services Access services revenue for 2009 decreased $45.1 million, or 11%, to $359.6 million as compared with 2008. Switched access revenue in 2009 of $246.3 million decreased $38.6 million, or 14%, as compared with 2008, primarily due to the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, email and other communications services. Access services revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies, including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to the FCC. Subsidy revenue, including surcharges billed to customers, for 2009 of $113.3 million decreased $6.5 million, or 5%, as compared with 2008, primarily due to lower receipts under the Federal High Cost Fund (FHCF) program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the programs National Average Cost per Local Loop (NACPL) used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. Access services revenue for 2008 decreased $74.7 million, or 16%, to $404.7 million as compared to 2007. Access services revenue for 2008 increased $2.6 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and legacy Frontier operations decreased $77.3 million, or 19%, as compared to 2007. Switched access revenue for 2008, excluding the unfavorable impact of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, decreased $56.8 million, or 20%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to the settlement of a carrier dispute resulting in a favorable impact on our 2007 revenue of $38.7 million (a one time event), and the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, email and other communications services. Excluding the impact of that one time favorable settlement in 2007, our switched access revenue for 2008 declined by $18.1 million, or 7% from 2007. Subsidy revenue for 2008, excluding the additional subsidy revenue attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions in 2008 and 2007, decreased $20.5 million, or 16%, in 2008 to $104.1 million, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower receipts under the FHCF program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the programs NACPL used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. Subsidy revenue in 2008 was also negatively impacted by $2.5 million in unfavorable adjustments resulting from audits of the FHCF program. Many factors may lead to further increases in the NACPL, thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future. The FCC and state regulatory agencies are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies. On May 1, 2008, the FCC issued an order to cap Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Companies (CETC) receipts from the high cost Federal Universal Service Fund. In 2009, the federal court upheld the FCCs order and the cap remains in place pending any future reform. The FCC is considering proposals that may significantly change interstate, intrastate and local intercarrier compensation and would revise the Federal Universal Service funding and disbursement mechanisms. When and how these proposed changes will be addressed are unknown and, accordingly, we are unable to predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations. However, future reductions in our subsidy and access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have associated variable expenses. Certain states have open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or access revenues. In addition, we have been approached by, and or are involved in formal state proceedings with, various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states. Long Distance Services Long distance services revenue for 2009 decreased $16.8 million, or 9%, to $165.8 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to a 3% reduction in the overall minutes of use and a reduction in the average revenue per minute of use. We expect our long distance services revenue to continue to trend downward. We have actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings. These offerings have resulted in an increase in long distance customers, and an increase in the minutes used by these customers. This has lowered our overall average rate per minute billed. While these package offerings have grown our long distance customer base, those customers who still pay on a per minute of use basis have reduced their calling volumes. Long distance services revenue for 2008 increased $2.0 million, or 1%, to $182.6 million as compared to 2007. Long distance services revenue for 2008 increased $5.8 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and legacy Frontier operations decreased $3.8 million, or 2%, as compared to 2007. During 2008, we actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings. 46 Our long distance services revenue may decrease in the future due to further declines in minutes of use or increased penetration of our unlimited calling packages. Competing services such as wireless, VOIP and cable telephony are resulting in a loss of customers, minutes of use and further declines in the rates we charge our customers. We expect these factors will continue to adversely affect our long distance revenue in the future. Directory Services Directory services revenue for 2009 decreased $6.3 million, or 6%, to $107.1 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to lower revenues from yellow pages local advertising. Directory services revenue for 2008 decreased $1.2 million, or 1%, to $113.3 million as compared to 2007. Directory services revenue for 2008 increased $2.8 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and our legacy Frontier operations decreased $4.0 million, or 4%, as compared to 2007 due to lower revenues from yellow pages advertising, mainly in Rochester, New York. Other Other revenue for 2009 decreased $15.3 million, or 19%, to $67.1 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to video promotional discounts of approximately $13.6 million. Other revenue for 2008 decreased $11.5 million, or 12%, to $82.4 million as compared to 2007. Other revenue was impacted by a decrease in equipment sales of $7.0 million, a decrease in service activation fee revenue of $3.3 million and decreased bill and collect fee revenue of $3.2 million, partially offset by higher DISH video revenue of $3.3 million.

Network access expenses for 2008 decreased $6.2 million, or 3%, to $222.0 million as compared to 2007 primarily due to decreasing rates resulting from more efficient circuit routing for our long distance and data products. Network access expenses for 2008 increased $8.9 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and legacy Frontier operations decreased $15.1 million, or 8%, as compared to 2007. During 2008, we expensed $4.2 million of promotional costs for Master Card gift cards issued to new HSI customers entering into a two year price protection plan and to existing customers who purchased additional services under a two year price protection plan and $3.0 million for a flat screen television promotion. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we expensed $11.4 million of promotional costs associated with fourth quarter HSI promotions that subsidized the cost of a new personal computer or a new digital camera provided to customers entering into a multi year commitment for certain bundled services. As we continue to offer aspirational gifts as part of our promotions, increase our sales of data products such as HSI and increase the penetration of our unlimited long distance calling plans, our network access expense may increase in the future. A decline in expenses associated with access line losses may offset some of the increase. 47 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES 2009 2008 2007 ($ in thousands) $ Increase % Increase $ Increase % Increase Amount (Decrease) (Decrease) Amount (Decrease) (Decrease) Amount Wage and benefit expenses $ 360,551 $ (23,173 ) (6%) $ 383,724 $ (12,210 ) (3%) $ 395,934 Pension costs 34,196 34,033 NM 163 14,771 101% (14,608 ) Severance and early retirement costs 3,788 (3,810 ) (50%) 7,598 (6,276 ) (45%) 13,874 Stock based compensation 9,368 1,580 20% 7,788 (1,234 ) (14%) 9,022 All other operating expenses 373,194 (38,281 ) (9%) 411,475 7,196 2% 404,279 $ 781,097 $ (29,651 ) (4%) $ 810,748 $ 2,247 0% $ 808,501 Wage and benefit expenses Wage and benefit expenses for 2009 decreased $23.2 million, or 6%, to $360.6 million as compared to 2008, primarily due to headcount reductions, decreases in compensation, reduced overtime costs and lower benefit expenses. Wage and benefit expenses for 2008 decreased $12.2 million, or 3%, to $383.7 million as compared to 2007. Wage and benefit expenses related to the CTE and GVN acquisitions decreased $4.2 million and legacy Frontier operations decreased $8.0 million primarily due to headcount reductions and associated decreases in compensation and benefit costs attributable to the integration of the back office, customer service and administrative support functions of the CTE and GVN operations acquired in 2007. Pension Costs The decline in the value of our pension plan assets during 2008 resulted in an increase in our pension expense in 2009. Pension costs for 2009 and 2008 were approximately $34.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Pension costs for 2009 include pension expense of $41.7 million, less amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures of $7.5 million. Pension costs for 2008 and 2007 were approximately $0.2 million and $(14.6) million, respectively. The amount for 2007 includes the costs for our CTE plans acquired in 2007 and reflects the positive impact of a pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million, resulting from the freeze placed on certain pension benefits of the former CTE non union employees. Also, effective December 31, 2007, the CTE Employees Pension Plan was merged into the Frontier Pension Plan. The Companys pension plan assets have increased from $589.8 million at December 31, 2008 to $608.6 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $18.8 million, or 3%. This increase is a result of positive investment returns of $90.2 million, or 15%, partially offset by ongoing benefit payments of $71.4 million, or 12%, during 2009. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our 2010 pension and other postretirement benefit expenses (which were $48.6 million in 2009) will be approximately $45.0 million to $55.0 million. No contributions were made to Frontiers pension plan during 2007, 2008 and 2009. We expect that we will make a $10.0 million cash contribution to our pension plan in 2010. 48 Severance and early retirement costs Severance and early retirement costs for 2009 decreased $3.8 million, or 50%, to $3.8 million as compared with 2008. Severance and early retirement costs for 2008 decreased $6.3 million, or 45%, as compared to 2007. Severance and early retirement costs of $7.6 million in 2008 include charges recorded in the first half of 2008 of $3.4 million related to employee early retirements and terminations for 42 Rochester, New York employees. Additional severance costs of $4.0 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, including $1.7 million of enhanced early retirement pension benefits related to 55 employees. Severance and early retirement costs of $13.9 million in 2007 include a third quarter charge of approximately $12.1 million related to initiatives to enhance customer service, streamline operations and reduce costs. Approximately 120 positions were eliminated as part of this 2007 initiative, most of which were filled by new employees at our remaining call centers. In addition, approximately 50 field operations employees agreed to participate in an early retirement program and another 30 employees from a variety of functions left the Company in 2007. Stock based compensation Stock based compensation for 2009 increased $1.6 million, or 20%, to $9.4 million as compared with 2008, due to increased costs for restricted stock awards. Stock based compensation for 2008 decreased $1.2 million, or 14%, as compared to 2007 due to reduced costs associated with stock units and stock options. All other operating expenses All other operating expenses for 2009 decreased $38.3 million, or 9%, to $373.2 million as compared to 2008, due to reduced costs for outside contractors and other vendors, as well as lower fuel, travel and USF surcharges, partially offset by slightly higher marketing expenses. All other operating expenses for 2008 increased $7.2 million, or 2%, to $411.5 million as compared to 2007, primarily due to the additional expenses attributable to the CTE and GVN acquisitions of $10.0 million in 2008 versus 2007, as 2008 includes a full year of expenses for CTE and GVN while 2007 included approximately ten months of costs for CTE and two months of costs for GVN. Our purchase of CTE has enabled us to realize cost savings by leveraging our centralized back office, customer service and administrative support functions over a larger customer base.

The decrease is primarily due to reduced amortization expense, as discussed below, and a declining net asset base, partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets is performed annually. We revised our useful lives based on the study effective October 1, 2009. Our composite depreciation rate decreased from 5.6% to 5.2% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $335.0 million to $355.0 million and amortization expense of approximately $56.2 million for 2010 related to our currently owned properties. 49 Amortization expense for 2009 is comprised of $57.9 million for amortization associated with our legacy Frontier properties, which were fully amortized in June 2009, and $56.3 million for intangible assets (customer base and trade name) that were acquired in the Commonwealth and Global Valley acquisitions. Amortization expense for our legacy Frontier properties was $126.4 million for 2008 and 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2008 increased $15.9 million, or 3%, to $561.8 million as compared to 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $26.6 million as a result of the CTE and GVN acquisitions, and decreased $10.7 million, or 2%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to a declining net asset base for our legacy Frontier properties, partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets.

Investment income for 2008 decreased $21.5 million, or 57%, to $16.1 million as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease of $22.1 million in income from short term investments of cash and cash equivalents due to a lower investable cash balance. Our average cash balances were $318.0 million, $177.5 million and $594.2 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2007 amount reflects the impact of borrowing $550.0 million in December 2006 in anticipation of the Commonwealth acquisition in 2007. 50 Other Income (Loss), net Other income (loss), net for 2009 declined $36.0 million to $(41.1) million as compared with 2008, primarily due to premiums paid on the early retirement of debt of $45.9 million in 2009, partially offset by increased litigation settlement proceeds of $3.8 million. Other income (loss), net for 2008 improved $12.7 million, or 71%, to $(5.2) million as compared to 2007. Other income (loss), net improved in 2008 primarily due to a reduction in the loss on retirement of debt of $11.9 million and the $4.1 million expense of a bridge loan fee recorded during the first quarter of 2007. Interest Expense Interest expense for 2009 increased $15.6 million, or 4%, to $378.2 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to higher average debt levels and interest rates in 2009. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2009 as compared with the prior year was 31 basis points higher, increasing from 7.54% to 7.85%. Interest expense for 2008 decreased $18.1 million, or 5%, to $362.6 million as compared to 2007, primarily due to the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the termination of our interest rate swap agreements and retirement of related debt during the first quarter of 2008, along with slightly lower average debt levels and average interest rates. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007, was 40 basis points lower, decreasing from 7.94% to 7.54%. Our average debt outstanding was $4,867.2 million, $4,753.0 million and $4,834.5 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher average debt levels for 2009 result primarily from our April 2009 debt offering of $600.0 million, as the net proceeds were not fully utilized to retire existing debt until the fourth quarter of 2009. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for 2009 decreased $36.6 million, or 34%, to $69.9 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to lower taxable income arising from lower operating income, lower investment income and loss on debt repurchases. The second quarter of 2008 included a reduction in income tax expense of $7.5 million that resulted from the expiration of certain statute of limitations on April 15, 2008, as discussed below. The effective tax rate for 2009 was 36.2% as compared with 36.6% for 2008 and 37.2% for 2007. Cash paid for taxes was $59.7 million, $78.9 million and $54.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our 2009 cash taxes were lower than 2008 and reflect the benefits from accelerated tax depreciation arising from the ARRA, utilization of AMT credits and higher interest expense arising from our debt offerings not fully offset by debt repurchases. We expect that in 2010 our cash taxes will be less than $10.0 million. We expect that our 2010 cash taxes will be reduced by the receipt of tax refunds arising from the retroactive application of a change in tax accounting for repairs and maintenance costs. In addition, our 2010 cash taxes will be impacted by approximately $60.0 million of tax benefits arising from our integration activities and secondarily, our 2009 debt refinancing activities. Absent the tax benefits generated by these integration and refinancing activities, we estimate that cash taxes would be approximately $60.0 million to $70.0 million in 2010. Refunds of approximately $56.2 million have been applied for in the Companys 2008 tax returns. The refunds result from a tax methods change applied for during the third quarter of 2009. Refunds are recorded on our balance sheet at December 31, 2009 in current assets within income taxes. We recorded approximately $8.2 million (net) related to uncertain tax positions under FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 (ASC Topic 740) in 2009. Income tax expense for 2008 decreased $21.5 million, or 17%, as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower taxable income and the reduction in income tax expense of $7.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 2008 that resulted from the expiration of certain statute of limitations on April 15, 2008, as discussed below. 51 As a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on April 15, 2008, the liabilities on our books as of December 31, 2007 related to uncertain tax positions recorded under FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 (ASC Topic 740) were reduced by $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2008. This reduction lowered income tax expense by $7.5 million, goodwill by $3.0 million and deferred income tax assets by $5.7 million during the second quarter of 2008.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio. Our long term debt as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 94% fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes. We had no interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt in effect at December 31, 2009. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, all but $278.1 million of our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2009 have fixed interest rates. In addition, our undrawn $250.0 million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with LIBOR, as defined. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2009, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our Senior Notes due in 2011 and 2013. Cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million were received in January 2008. The related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet, and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2009, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately $4.6 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 7.85% and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately 11.5 years. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations had been extended over the weighted average maturity as of December 31, 2008 by approximately 1.5 years due to the debt offerings and refinancing activities that occurred during 2009. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of December 31, 2009 is limited to our pension assets. We have no other security investments of any material amount. During 2008 and 2009, the diminished availability of credit and liquidity in the United States and throughout the global financial system has resulted in substantial volatility in financial markets and the banking system. These and other economic events have had an adverse impact on investment portfolios. The decline in the value of our pension plan assets during 2008 resulted in an increase in our pension expense in 2009. The Companys pension plan assets have increased from $589.8 million at December 31, 2008 to $608.6 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $18.8 million, or 3%. This increase is a result of positive investment returns of $90.2 million, or 15%, partially offset by ongoing benefit payments of $71.4 million, or 12%, during 2009. We expect that we will make a $10.0 million cash contribution to our pension plan in 2010. 53
