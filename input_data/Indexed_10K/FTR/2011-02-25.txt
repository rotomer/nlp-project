Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements. Statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously. Forward looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, and our future results may b e materially affected by, potential risks or uncertainties. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all potential risks or uncertainties. We note the following as a partial list: Our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the Acquired Business into Frontiers existing operations; The risk that the growth opportunities and cost synergies from the Transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; Our indemnity obligation to Verizon for taxes which may be imposed upon them as a result of changes in ownership of our stock may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during the two year period ending July 2012 in a transaction that stockholders might consider favorable; The effects of increased expenses incurred due to activities related to the Transaction and the integration of the Acquired Business; Our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; The effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product or service offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; Reductions in the number of our access lines that cannot be offset by increases in HSI subscribers and sales of other products and services; The effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of such legislation and regulation; The effects of changes in the availability of federal and state universal funding to us and our competitors; The effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers; Our ability to adjust successfully to changes in the communications industry and to implement strategies for growth; Adverse changes in the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of financing; Continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition or technology substitutions; Our ability to effectively manage service quality in our territories and meet mandated service quality metrics; Our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to customers; Changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulations; 29 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, and to repay, reduce or refinance our debt; The effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets that we serve, which can affect demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenues and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; The effects of customer bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in difficulty in collection of revenues and loss of customers; The effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; The effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; Changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments; The effects of state regulatory cash management practices that could limit our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries or dividend funds up to the parent company; Our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2011 and thereafter; Declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which would require us to make increased contributions to the pension plan in 2011 and beyond; Limitations on the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital until July 2012; Our ability to pay dividends on our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and liquidity; The effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; and The effects of severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, ice storms or other natural or man made disasters. Any of the foregoing events, or other events, could cause financial information to vary from managements forward looking statements included in this report. You should consider these important factors, as well as the risks set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors, in evaluating any statement in this report on Form 10 K or otherwise made by us or on our behalf. The following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. We have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements and do not undertake to do so. Expected Cost Savings Resulting from the Merger Based on current estimates and assumptions, we expect to achieve significant cost savings as a result of the Merger, principally (1) by leveraging the scalability of our existing corporate administrative functions and information technology and network systems to cover certain former Acquired Business functions and systems and (2) by internalizing certain functions formerly provided by third party service providers to the Acquired Business. We estimate that our annualized cost savings will reach approximately $550 million by the end of 2012 as we implement a targeted list of initiatives. During 2010, we realized cost savings of approximately $140 million from this target list, primarily by the elimination of costs related to the previous owners centralized services applicable to the Acquired Business, in addition to a number of other cost reduction initiatives like the elimination of outside contractors. Our fourth quarter savings from the targeted initiatives list was approximately $76 million and equates to an annualized run rate of approximately $304 million. We expect to achieve annualized cost savings of approximately $400 million by the end of 2011 and $550 million by the end of 2012. The realization of the additional annual cost savin gs is expected to be fully achieved by the end of 2012, when the Acquired Businesss network and information technology systems and processes will be fully integrated with those of Frontier. The foregoing future cost savings are based on our estimates and assumptions that, although we consider them reasonable, are inherently uncertain. These expected cost savings are subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. See Forward Looking Statements above. As a result, there can be no assurance that these or any other cost savings or synergies will actually be realized. 30 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (a) Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $251.3 million (excluding restricted cash of $187.5 million, representing funds set aside for future broadband expansion and service quality initiatives). Our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we used cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund all of our cash investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2010, we had a working capital deficiency of $310.9 million. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and new revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt payments, pay taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy, pay our acquisition and integration costs and capital expenditures, and support our short term and long term operating strategies through 2011. However, a number of factors, including but not limited to, losses of access lines, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated from operations. In addition, altho ugh we believe, based on information available to us, that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us, given the current economic environment, this could change in the future. Further, our below investment grade credit ratings may also make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt. As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $280.0 million and $180.4 million of debt maturing in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The consummation of the Transaction resulted in a combined company with significantly larger business operations and, consequently, greater working capital, capital expenditure and other liquidity needs. Upon consummation of the Transaction, we assumed approximately $3.5 billion principal amount of debt. As a result of our greater liquidity requirements, we entered into a new revolving credit facility which increased our line of credit to $750.0 million to provide sufficient flexibility to meet our liquidity needs. Based on the level of debt incurred and the additional cash flows resulting from the Transaction, our capacity to service our debt has been significantly enhanced as compared to our capacity immediately prior to the Merger, although our overall debt increased. At December 31, 2010, the ratio of our net debt to adjusted operating cash flow (leverage ratio) was 2.98 times. In addition, the FCC and certain state regulatory commissions, in connection with granting their approvals of the Transaction, specified certain capital expenditure and operating requirements for our business for specified periods of time post closing. These requirements focus primarily on certain capital investment commitments to three state regulatory commissions to expand broadband availability and speeds to at least 85% of the households throughout the acquired Territories with minimum speeds of 3 Mbps by the end of 2013 and 4 Mbps by the end of 2015. To satisfy all or part of certain capital investment commitments, we placed an aggregate amount of $115.0 million in cash into escrow accounts and obtained a letter of credit for $190.0 million in the third quarter of 2010. Another $72.4 million of cash in an escrow account, with an a ssociated liability for the same amount, was acquired in connection with the Merger to be used for service quality initiatives in the state of West Virginia. The aggregate amount of these escrow accounts and the letter of credit will decrease over time as Frontier makes the required capital expenditures in the respective states. The Transaction provides for a post closing calculation of working capital. Frontier and Verizon have not finalized the results of this calculation nor the post closing adjustment, if any. The final resolution of this process will not negatively impact Frontiers balance sheet or working capital. Cash Flow provided by Operating Activities Cash flow provided by operating activities improved $479.5 million, or 65%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. The improvement was primarily the result of incremental cash flow from the Acquired Business. Cash paid for taxes was $19.9 million, $59.7 million and $78.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our 2010 cash taxes were lower than 2009 due to the impact of bonus depreciation in accordance with the 2010 Tax Relief Act. We expect that in 2011 our cash taxes will be approximately $50 million to $75 million. Our 2011 cash tax estimate reflects the continued impact of bonus depreciation under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. 31 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES In connection with the Transaction, the Company undertook activities to plan and implement information systems conversions and other initiatives necessary to effectuate the Merger, which occurred on July 1, 2010. As a result, the Company incurred $137.1 million of acquisition and integration costs related to integration activities during 2010. Cash Flow used by Investing Activities Acquisitions On July 1, 2010, Frontier issued common shares with a value of $5.2 billion and made payments of $105.0 million in cash as consideration for the Acquired Business. In addition, as part of the Transaction, Frontier assumed approximately $3.5 billion in debt. Capital Expenditures In 2010, 2009 and 2008, our capital expenditures were $577.9 million (including $97.0 million of integrationrelated capital expenditures), $256.0 million (including $25.0 million of integration related capital expenditures) and $288.3 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2010 included $254.2 million associated with the Acquired Business. We continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects, emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction. We anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $750 million to $780 million for 2011 related to our Frontier legacy properties and the Acquired Business. In connection with the Transaction, the Company undertook activities to plan and implement systems conversions and other initiatives necessary to effectuate the closing, which occurred on July 1, 2010. As a result, the Company incurred $97.0 million and $25.0 million of capital expenditures related to these integration activities in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash Flow used by and provided from Financing Activities Issuance of Debt Securities On April 12, 2010, and in anticipation of the Merger, the Verizon subsidiary then holding the assets of the Acquired Business completed a private offering of $3.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The gross proceeds of the offering, plus $125.5 million (the Transaction Escrow) contributed by Frontier, were deposited into an escrow account. Immediately prior to the Merger, the proceeds of the notes offering (less the initial purchasers discount) were released from the escrow account and used to make a special cash payment to Verizon, as contemplated by the Transaction, with amounts in excess of the special cash payment and the initial purchasers discount received by the Company (approximately $53.0 million). In addition, the $125.5 million Transaction Escrow was returned to the Company. Upon completion of the Merger, we entered into a supplemental indenture with The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, pursuant to which we assumed the obligations under the senior notes. The senior notes consist of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Notes), $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes), $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes). The 2015 Notes have an interest rate of 7.875% per annum, the 2017 Notes have an interest rate of 8.25% per annum, the 2020 Notes have an interest rate of 8.50% per annum and the 2022 Notes have an interest rate of 8.75% per annum. The Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to 100% of their face value. In the third quarter of 2010, we completed an exchange offer for the privately placed Senior Notes for registered notes. Upon completion of the Merger, we also assumed additional debt of $250.0 million, including $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.73% Senior Notes due February 15, 2028 and $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.40% Senior Notes due October 15, 2029. On October 1, 2009, we completed a registered debt offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2018. The issue price was 98.441% of the principal amount of the notes, and we received net proceeds of approximately $578.7 million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand (including cash proceeds from our April 2009 debt offering described below), to finance a cash tender offer for our outstanding 9.250% Senior Notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and our outstanding 6.250% Senior Notes due 2013 (the 2013 Notes), as described below. 32 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES On April 9, 2009, we completed a registered offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014. The issue price was 91.805% of the principal amount of the notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $538.8 million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase outstanding debt, as described below. On March 28, 2008, we borrowed $135.0 million under a senior unsecured term loan facility that was established on March 10, 2008. The loan matures in 2013 and bears interest based on the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our election, plus a margin which varies depending on our debt leverage ratio. We used the proceeds to repurchase, during the first quarter of 2008, $128.7 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes and to pay for the $6.3 million of premium on early retirement of those notes. Debt Reduction In 2010, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $7.2 million of debt, consisting of $2.8 million of senior unsecured debt and $4.4 million of rural utilities service loan contracts. In 2009, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $1,048.3 million of debt, consisting of $1,047.3 million of senior unsecured debt, as described in more detail below, and $1.0 million of rural utilities service loan contracts. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company purchased and retired, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer referred to above, approximately $564.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes and approximately $83.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes. The aggregate consideration for these debt repurchases was $701.6 million, which was financed with the proceeds of the October 2009 debt offering and a portion of the proceeds of the April 2009 debt offering, each as described above. The repurchases in the tender offer resulted in a loss on the early retirement of debt of approximately $53.7 million, which we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition to the debt tender offer, we used $388.9 million of the April 2009 debt offering proceeds to repurchase in 2009 $396.7 million principal amount of debt, consisting of $280.8 million of the 2011 Notes, $54.1 million of our 7.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2027, $35.9 million of the 2013 Notes, $16.0 million of our 7.125% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 and $9.9 million of our 6.80% Debentures due August 15, 2026. An additional $7.8 million net gain was recognized and included in Other income (loss), net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of these other debt repurchases. In 2008, we retired an aggregate principal amount of $144.7 million of debt, consisting of $128.7 million principal amount of the 2011 Notes, $12.0 million of other senior unsecured debt and rural utilities service loan contracts, and $4.0 million of 5% Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities (EPPICS). We may from time to time repurchase our debt in the open market, through tender offers, exchanges of debt securities, by exercising rights to call or in privately negotiated transactions. We may also refinance existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations. Interest Rate Management On January 15, 2008, we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing $400.0 million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes. Cash proceeds from the swap terminations of approximately $15.5 million were received in January 2008. The related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet, and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt. We recognized $1.0 million, $7.6 million and $5.0 million of deferred gain during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and anticipate recognizing an additional $1.0 million of deferred gain during 2011. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not have any derivative instruments. Letter of Credit Facility On September 8, 2010, we entered into a $190.0 million unsecured letter of credit facility. The terms of the letter of credit facility are set forth in a Credit Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2010, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto, and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch (the Bank), as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank (the Letter of Credit Agreement). The letter of credit was issued in its entirety as of December 31, 2010. The commitments under the Letter of Credit Agreement expire on September 20, 2011, with a Bank option to extend up to $100.0 million of the commitments to September 20, 2012. The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee on the available commitment, regardless of usage. The covenants binding on the Company under the terms of the Letter of Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those in the Companys other credit facilities, including limitations on liens, substantial asset sales and mergers, subject to customary exceptions and thresholds. A letter of credit for $190.0 million was issued to the West Virginia Public Service Commission to guarantee certain of our capital investment commitments in West Virginia in connection with the Transaction. 33 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Credit Facility On March 23, 2010, we entered into a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that became effective on July 1, 2010, concurrently with the closing of the Merger and the termination of the Companys previously existing revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2010, we had not made any borrowings utilizing this facility. The terms of the Credit Facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2010, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement). Associated facility fees under the Credit Facility will vary from time to time depending on the Companys credit rating (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and were 0.625% per annum as of December 31, 2010. The Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on Janua ry 1, 2014. During the term of the Credit Facility, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow funds, and may obtain letters of credit, subject to customary borrowing conditions. Loans under the Credit Facility will bear interest based on the alternate base rate or the adjusted LIBOR rate (each as determined in the Credit Agreement), at the Companys election, plus a margin specified in the Credit Agreement based on the Companys credit rating. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility will also be subject to fees that vary depending on the Companys credit rating. The Credit Facility will be available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments. Covenants The terms and conditions contained in our indentures, the Credit Agreement and the Letter of Credit Agreement include the timely payment of principal and interest when due, the maintenance of our corporate existence, keeping proper books and records in accordance with U.S. GAAP, restrictions on the incurrence of liens on our assets, and restrictions on asset sales and transfers, mergers and other changes in corporate control. We are not subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract, rule or regulation, other than that imposed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. However, we would be restricted under the Credit Agreement and the Letter of Credit Agreement from declaring dividends if an event of default had occurred and was continuing at the time or would result from the dividend declaration. Our $200.0 million term loan facility with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), which matures in 2011, the Credit Facility, and our $150.0 million and $135.0 million senior unsecured term loans, each contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant. Under those covenants, we are required to maintain a ratio of (i) total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) in excess of $50.0 million to (ii) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) over the last four quarters no greater than 4.50 to 1. The Credit Facility, the Letter of Credit Facility and certain indentures for our senior unsecured debt obligations limit our ability to create liens or merge or consolidate with other companies and our subsidiaries ability to borrow funds, subject to important exceptions and qualifications. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants. Share Repurchase Programs There were no shares repurchased during 2010 and 2009 under share repurchase programs. During 2008, we repurchased 17,778,300 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $200.0 million. Dividends We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends. Our ability to fund a regular quarterly dividend will be impacted by our ability to generate cash from operations. The declarations and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Effective July 1, 2010, our Board of Directors set the annual cash dividend rate at $0.75 per share, subject to applicable law and within the discretion of our Board of Directors. 34 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Future Commitments A summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 is as follows: Contractual Obligations: ($ in thousands) Payment due by period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long term debt obligations, excluding interest $ 8,326,994 $ 280,002 $ 890,221 $ 1,401,066 $ 5,755,705 Interest on long term debt 7,098,592 652,903 1,255,196 1,082,483 4,108,010 Operating lease obligations 119,180 68,087 31,572 12,993 6,528 Purchase obligations 109,052 45,722 62,882 448 Liability for uncertain tax positions 54,864 26,674 24,466 3,724 Total $ 15,708,682 $ 1,073,388 $ 2,264,337 $ 2,500,714 $ 9,870,243 At December 31, 2010, we have outstanding performance letters of credit totaling $229.9 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and judg ments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long lived assets, impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, contingencies and purchase price allocations, among others. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts. In 2010 and 2009, we had no critical estimates related to bankruptcies of telecommunications companies or any other customers. Asset Impairment We review long lived assets to be held and used and long lived assets to be disposed of, including customer lists, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required. In 2010 and 2009, we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments. 35 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Intangibles Our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name, which resulted from the purchase of ILEC properties. We test for impairment of these assets annually, or more frequently, as circumstances warrant. We test for goodwill impairment at the operating segment level, as that term is defined in U.S. GAAP. As of July 1, 2010 and as a result of the completion of the Transaction, our operating segments (reporting units) increased from 3 (at December 31, 2009) to 5 (effective as of July 1, 2010). This structure is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Makers (CEO, CFO, COO) review our results on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. After making the change in our operating segments, we reviewed our goodwill impairment test by comparing the EBITDA multiples for ea ch reporting unit to their carrying values noting that no impairment indicator was present. No potential impairment was indicated and no further analysis was deemed necessary. All of our ILEC properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result, we aggregate our five operating segments into one reportable segment. Each of the below noted reporting units is an operating segment. The first step in the goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit to its fair value. In determining fair value of goodwill at December 31, 2010, we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ILEC properties as well as reconciled these values to the trading values of our publicly traded common stock. Additionally, we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity. The result of this first step indicated that fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of such r eporting units. As a result, the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required. Goodwill by reporting unit (operating segment) at December 31, 2010 is as follows: Reporting Units ($ in thousands) Northeast Southeast West Central Midwest Goodwill $ 1,098,211 $ 1,275,633 $ 1,525,687 $ 1,576,898 $ 815,765 Prior to the Transaction, and the related increase in operating segments, we reorganized our management and operating structure during the first quarter of 2009 to include our Rochester market with our existing New York State properties and the rest of the East Region. At that time, we determined that no impairment was indicated at both December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 for either the East or Rochester reporting units and combining them did not alter the conclusion at either date. We estimate fair value in two ways: (1) marketplace company comparison based and (2) equity based utilizing our share price. Enterprise values for rural ILEC properties are typically quoted as a multiple of cash flow or EBITDA. Marketplace company comparisons and analyst reports support a range of values around a multiple of 6 to 6.5 times annualized EBITDA. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test we define EBITDA as operating income plus depreciation and amortization. We determined the fair value estimates using 6.5 times EBITDA but also used lower EBITDA multiples to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess of fair value over the carrying values of the reporting units. Additionally, a second test was performed using our public market equity value or market capitalization. Market capitalization (current market stock price times total shares outstanding) is a public market indicator of equity value and is useful in corroborating the 6.5 times EBITDA valuation because we are singularly engaged in rural ILEC operating activities. Our stock price on December 31, 2010 was $9.73 and when compared to the fair value using the EBITDA multiple obtained above, exceeded such value before consideration of any applicable control premium. We also used lower per share stock prices to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess fair value over the carrying value. Total market capitalization determined in this manner is then allocated to the reporting units based upon each units relative share of consolidated EBITDA. Our method of determining fair value has been consistently applied for the three years ending December 31, 2010. Depreciation and Amortization The calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. An independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment assets is performed annually. We revised our useful lives for Frontier legacy plant assets, and the plant assets of the Acquired Business, based on the study effective October 1, 2010. For the plant assets of the Acquired Business, an independent study was performed to develop the appropriate depreciation rates based on Frontiers existing rates, while also incorporating factors unique to the plant assets of the Acquired Business. The composite depreciation rate for our plant assets is 7.6% as a result of the study. Intangible assets acquired in the Transaction were recorded based on an estimated fair value of $2.5 billion and an estimated useful life of nine years for the residential customer list, as distinguished from the 12 years used for the business customer list. For both classes of assets, the "sum of the years digits" method was used to amortize the intangible assets, which tracks more closely with the projected revenue stream of each asset class. Our Frontier legacy customer list intangible assets do not distinguish between residential and business classes and the amortization period is five years on the straight line method. We periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $820.0 million to $840.0 million and amortization expense of approximately $510.0 million for 2011. 36 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Our estimates of pension expense, other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates. In connection with the completion of the Merger on July 1, 2010, certain employees were transferred from various Verizon pension plans into 12 pension plans that were then merged with the Frontier Communications Pension Plan (the Plan) effective August 31, 2010. Assets of $581.3 million, including approximately $142.5 million that represents a receivable of the Plan as of December 31, 2010, were transferred into the Plan during the second half of 2010, with the receivable to be settled by the transfer of assets by the end of the third quarter of 2011. We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant num ber of our current and former Frontier legacy employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. All of the employees who are still accruing pension benefits are represented employees. The accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions. The discount rate is used to value, on a present value basis, our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term, high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve, the Citigroup Above Median Pension Curve, t he Towers Watson Index, the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. Our discount rate was 5.25% at year end 2010, and 5.75% at year end 2009. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 35% to 55% in fixed income securities, 35% to 55% in equity securities and 5% to 15% in alternative investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of ou r fiscal year. In 2009 and 2010, our expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 8.0%. Our actual return on plan assets in 2010 was 12.1%. For 2011, we will continue to assume a rate of return of 8.0%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date. We expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for 2011 will be approximately $70 million to $80 million before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures (they were $68.4 million in 2010 before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures, including the plan expenses of the Acquired Business for the second half of 2010), and that we will make a cash contribution to our pension plan of approximately $50 million in 2011. We made cash contributions of $13.1 million in 2010. No contributions were made to our pension plan during 2008 or 2009. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2010 increased to 42.5%, primarily related to the write off of certain deferred tax assets of approximately $11.3 million related to Merger transaction costs which were not tax deductible. Prior to the closing of the Merger, these costs were deemed to be tax deductible as the Transaction had not yet been successfully completed. These costs were incurred to facilitate the Merger and once the Merger closed, these costs must be capitalized for tax purposes. Our effective tax rates in 2008 and 2009 were approximately at the statutory rates. Contingencies We currently do not have any contingencies in excess of $5.0 million recorded on our books, except for items preliminarily estimated in purchase accounting. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Purchase Price Allocation The Transaction The allocation of the approximate $5.4 billion in total consideration to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities of the Acquired Business is a critical estimate. The estimates of the fair values assigned to plant, customer list and goodwill, are more fully described in Notes 3, 4 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the estimated expected life of a customer (used to amortize the customer list) is a critical estimate. New Accounting Pronouncements There were no new accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2010, or that would be adopted in future years, with any material financial statement impact. 38 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (b) Results of Operations Effective July 1, 2010, the Companys scope of operations and balance sheet capitalization changed materially as a result of the completion of the Transaction. Historical financial and operating data presented for Frontier is not indicative of future results and includes the results of operations of the Acquired Business from the date of acquisition on July 1, 2010. The financial discussion and tables below include a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for our Frontier operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. We have also presented an analysis of each category of revenue and operating expenses for 2010 for the results of Frontier legacy operations (excluding the Acquired Business) and the results of the Acquired Business for the second half of 2010, as included in the consolidated results of operations. All variance explanations discussed below are based upon an analysis of the 2010 financial data for Frontier legacy operations (excluding the Acquired Business) in comparison to 2009, except that the first two sentences in each category of revenue or operating expenses below shows the revenue, operating expenses and or variances based upon an analysis of Frontier including the Acquired Business. Frontier has shown these adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude the effects of the Acquired Business because of the magnitude of the Transaction and its impact to our financial results in 2010, as compared to 2009. REVENUE Revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local, network access, long distance, and data and internet services. Such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts. Consolidated revenue for 2010 increased $1,679.8 million, or 79%, to $3,797.7 million as compared to 2009. Excluding additional revenue of $1,748.1 million attributable to the Acquired Business, our revenue decreased $68.3 million, or 3% as compared to 2009. Revenues from data and internet services such as HSI grew and increased for our Frontier legacy properties as a percentage of total revenues and revenues from voice services like local and long distance services and from switched access and subsidy (including federal and state subsidies) declined and decreased as a percentage of our total revenues. This decline for our Frontier legacy operations in 2010 is a result of decreases in the number of residential and business customers, switched access revenue, long distance services revenue and directory revenue, pa rtially offset by a $28.8 million, or 5%, increase in data and internet services revenue, each as described in more detail below. Consolidated revenue for 2009 decreased $119.1 million, or 5%, to $2,117.9 million as compared to 2008. This decline is a result of lower local services revenue, switched access revenue, long distance services revenue and subsidy revenue, partially offset by a $33.2 million, or 5%, increase in data and internet services revenue, each as described in more detail below. Change in the number of our access lines is one metric that is important to our revenue and profitability. Our Frontier legacy operations lost access lines primarily because of changing consumer behavior (including wireless substitution), economic conditions, changing technology, competition, and by the loss of second lines upon the addition of HSI or cable modem service. Our Frontier legacy operations lost approximately 128,000 access lines (net) during 2010, or 6% on an annual basis, comparable to the 136,800 access lines (net), or 6% on an annual basis, lost during 2009. The Acquired Business lost approximately 201,000 access lines (net) during the six months ended December 31, 2010. Economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our bundles, and cause us to increase our promotions and or lowe r our prices for our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenue, profitability and cash flow. During 2010, our Frontier legacy operations added approximately 16,200 HSI subscribers. During 2009, we added approximately 56,000 HSI subscribers, primarily due to our Rolling Thunder promotion. The Acquired Business experienced a loss of approximately 4,100 HSI subscribers during the six months ended December 31, 2010. We expect to continue to increase HSI subscribers in our Frontier legacy operations in 2011 and expect to increase the number of HSI subscribers in the Acquired Business during 2011. While the number of access lines is an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends, it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate our business. Management believes that customer counts and understanding different components of revenue is most important. For this reason, presented in the table titled Other Financial and Operating Data below is a breakdown that presents customer counts, average monthly revenue, products per customer, percentage of customers on price protection plans and churn. It also categorizes revenue into customer revenue (residential and business) and regulatory revenue (switched access and subsidy revenue). Despite the 7% decline in residential customers and the 6% decline in total access lines, customer revenue, which is all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue, for our Frontier legacy operations declined in 2010 by only 2 percent as compared to the prior year period. The decline in customers and access lines for our Frontier legacy operations was partially offset by increased penetration of additional products sold to both residential and business customers, which has increased our average monthly revenue per customer. A substantial further loss of customers and access lines, combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue, profitability and cash flows to decrease in 2011. 39 OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA As of % Increase As of As of % Increase As of December 31, 2010 (Decrease) July 1, 2010 December 31, 2009 (Decrease) December 31, 2008 Access lines: Residential 3,635,670 (6%) 3,855,141 1,349,510 (7%) 1,454,268 Business 2,110,048 (2%) 2,154,109 768,002 (4%) 800,065 Total access lines 5,745,718 (4%) 6,009,250 2,117,512 (6%) 2,254,333 HSI subscribers 1,697,167 0% 1,696,576 635,947 10% 579,943 Video subscribers 531,446 5% 504,544 172,961 44% 119,919 For the year ended December 31, $ Increase % Increase $ Increase % Increase 2010 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2009 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2008 Revenue (in 000s): Residential $ 1,678,551 $ 778,751 87% $ 899,800 $ (49,484 ) (5%) $ 949,284 Business 1,621,349 762,889 89% 858,460 (24,561 ) (3%) 883,021 Total customer revenue $ 3,299,900 $ 1,541,640 88% $ 1,758,260 $ (74,045 ) (4%) $ 1,832,305 Regulatory (switched access and subsidy) 497,775 138,141 38% 359,634 (45,079 ) (11%) 404,713 Total revenue $ 3,797,675 $ 1,679,781 79% $ 2,117,894 $ (119,124 ) (5%) $ 2,237,018 Switched access minutes of use (in millions) 14,542 64% 8,854 (12%) 10,027 Average monthly total revenue per access line Frontier Legacy $ 83.20 3% $ 80.74 1% $ 79.62 Average monthly customer revenue per access line Frontier Legacy $ 69.89 4% $ 67.03 3% $ 65.22 As of or for the As of or for the As of or for the year ended % Increase year ended % Increase year ended December 31, 2010 (Decrease) December 31, 2009 (Decrease) December 31, 2008 Residential Customer Metrics: Customers 3,445,193 175% 1,254,508 (7%) 1,347,423 Revenue (in 000s) $ 1,678,551 87% $ 899,800 (5%) $ 949,284 Products per Residential Customer (1) Frontier Legacy 2.60 3% 2.52 6% 2.37 Average monthly residential revenue per customer Frontier Legacy $ 60.31 5% $ 57.62 2% $ 56.42 Percent of Customers on Price Protection Plans Frontier Legacy 58.4 % 10% 53.3 % 20% 44.6 % Customer Monthly Churn Frontier Legacy 1.33 % (10%) 1.47 % (6%) 1.57 % Business Customer Metrics: Customers 343,823 144% 140,763 Revenue (in 000s) $ 1,621,349 89% $ 858,460 Average monthly business revenue per customer Frontier Legacy $ 511.33 5% $ 485.72 (1) Products per residential customer: primary residential voice line, HSI and video products have a value of 1.

Local and long distance services revenue for 2010 increased $916.2 million as a result of the Acquired Business. Local and long distance services revenue for our Frontier legacy operations decreased $66.0 million, or 7%, as compared with 2009. Local and enhanced services revenue for our Frontier legacy operations declined $70.2 million in 2010, primarily due to the continued loss of access lines and, to a lesser extent, decreases in private line services and feature packages. Long distance services revenue for our Frontier legacy operations for 2010 increased $4.2 million as compared with 2009, primarily due to an increase in the number of long distance customers using our bundled service offerings partially offset by lower minutes of use and a lower average revenue per minute of use. We have actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings. These offerings have resulted in an increase in long distance customers and an increase in the minutes used by these customers. This has lowered our overall average rate per minute billed. While these package offerings have grown our long distance customer base, those customers paying on a per minute of use basis have reduced their calling volumes. Local and long distance services revenue for 2009 decreased $83.8 million, or 8%, to $947.2 million, as compared with 2008. Local and enhanced services revenue for 2009 decreased $67.0 million, or 8%, to $781.4 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to the continued loss of access lines that accounted for $41.9 million of the decline and a reduction in all other related services revenue of $25.1 million. Enhanced services revenue in 2009 decreased $14.7 million, as compared with 2008, primarily due to a decline in access lines and a shift in customers purchasing our unlimited voice communications packages with features included in the bundle instead of purchasing individual features. Long distance services revenue for 2009 decreased $16.8 million, or 9%, to $165.8 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to a 3% reduction in the overall minutes of use and a reduction in the average revenue per minute of use. Data and Internet Services Data and internet services revenue for 2010 increased $596.8 million, or 93%, to $1,235.6 million, as compared with 2009. Data and internet services revenue increased $568.0 million as a result of the Acquired Business and increased $28.8 million, or 5%, for our Frontier legacy operations, as compared with 2009, primarily due to the overall growth in the number of HSI subscribers and high capacity Internet and ethernet circuits purchased by customers. Data services revenue for our Frontier legacy operations for 2010 increased $15.8 million to $373.0 million, as compared with 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the number of the Companys HSI subscribers for our Frontier legacy operations increased by approximately 16,200, or 3%, since December 31, 2009. Data and internet services also includes revenue from data transmission services t o other carriers and high volume commercial customers with dedicated high capacity Internet and ethernet circuits. Nonswitched access revenue for our Frontier legacy operations for 2010 increased $13.0 million to $294.6 million as compared to 2009, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. Data and internet services revenue for 2009 increased $33.2 million, or 5%, to $638.8 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to the overall growth in the number of HSI subscribers and high capacity Internet and ethernet circuits purchased by customers. As of December 31, 2009, the number of the Companys HSI subscribers had increased by approximately 56,000, or 10%, since December 31, 2008. We have used aspirational gifts or promotional credits to drive growth in HSI subscribers. Revenue from dedicated high capacity circuits increased $7.3 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, primarily due to growth in the number of those circuits. On March 16, 2010, the FCC released, as required under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), its National Broadband Plan. The National Broadband Plan proposes a series of actions that could result in additional regulatory requirements for broadband services as well as a series of other regulatory reforms. As a follow up to the National Broadband plan, on February 8, 2011, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment from the industry on both short and long term reforms to Intercarrier Compensation and the Federal Universal Service High Cost Fund. The Notice asks for comment on a broad range of possible outcomes and Frontier cannot predict whether or when the FCC will take additional actions or the effect of any such actions on the Companys subsidy revenues. 41 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Switched Access and Subsidy Switched access and subsidy revenue for 2010 increased $138.1 million, or 38%, to $497.8 million as compared with 2009. For 2010, switched access and subsidy revenue represented 13% of our total revenue. Switched access and subsidy revenue for 2010 increased $169.9 million as a result of the Acquired Business. Switched access revenue was $285.5 million in 2010, or 8% of our revenues, up from $246.3 million in 2009, or 12% of our revenues. Federal and state subsidy revenue, including surcharges of $73.8 million billed to customers which are remitted to the FCC, was $212.3 million in 2010, or 6% of our revenues, up from $113.3 million in 2009, or 5% of our revenues. We expect a further decline in switched access and subsidy revenue in 2011. Switched access revenue for our Frontier legacy operations for 2010 of $213.9 million decreased $32.5 million, or 13%, as compared with 2009. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, email and other communications services. Switched access and subsidy revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies, including surcharges billed to customers which are remitted to the FCC. Subsidy revenue for our Frontier legacy operations, including surcharges billed to customers of $41.1 million, for 2010 of $114.0 million increased $0.7 million, or 1%, as compared with 2009. Federal and state subsidy revenue including surcharges (which are billed to customers and remitted to the FCC) for our Frontier legacy operations were $63.6 million, $9.3 million and $41.1 million, respectively, for 2010. Switched access and subsidy revenue for 2009 decreased $45.1 million, or 11%, to $359.6 million as compared with 2008. Switched access revenue in 2009 of $246.3 million decreased $38.6 million, or 14%, as compared with 2008, primarily due to the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless, email and other communications services. Access services revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies, including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to the FCC. Subsidy revenue, including surcharges billed to customers of $35.5 million, for 2009 of $113.3 million decreased $6.5 million, or 5%, as compared with 2008, primarily due to lower receipts under the Federal High Cost Fund (FHCF) program resulting from o ur reduced cost structure and an increase in the programs National Average Cost per Local Loop (NACPL) used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. Federal and state subsidy revenue including surcharges (which are billed to customers and remitted to the FCC) were $69.1 million, $8.7 million and $35.5 million, respectively, for 2009. The federal and state subsidy revenue for 2009 represents 5% of our consolidated revenues. Federal subsidies are driven by many factors, including the NACPL. Many factors may lead to further increases in the NACPL, thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future. The FCC and state regulatory agencies are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies. In addition, some of the reform proposals direct additional support for broadband deployment which could create an opportunity for additional federal subsidy support. Certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation. In addition, we have been approached by, and or are involved in formal state proceedings with, various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses. Directory Services Directory services revenue for 2010 decreased $4.3 million, or 4%, to $102.8 million, as compared with 2009. Directory services revenue for 2010 increased $9.3 million as a result of the Acquired Business. Directory services revenue for our Frontier legacy operations decreased $13.6 million, or 13%, as compared with 2009, primarily due to a decline in yellow pages advertising. 42 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Directory services revenue for 2009 decreased $6.3 million, or 6%, to $107.1 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to lower revenues from yellow pages local advertising. Other Other revenue for 2010 increased $98.9 million, or 152%, to $164.1 million, as compared with 2009. Other revenue for 2010 increased $84.6 million as a result of the Acquired Business. Other revenue for our Frontier legacy operations increased $14.3 million, or 22%, as compared with 2009, primarily due to reduced DISH video credits and lower bad debt expenses that are charged against revenue, partially offset by decreases in bill and collect fee revenue. Other revenue for 2009 decreased $17.2 million, or 21%, to $65.2 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to video promotional discounts of approximately $13.6 million.

Network access expenses for 2010 increased $173.5 million as a result of the Acquired Business. Network access expenses for our Frontier legacy operations decreased $15.8 million, or 7%, to $210.1 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to lower aspirational gift and long distance carriage costs in 2010. In 2009, we expensed $10.0 million for the cost of new personal computers provided to customers in connection with our Rolling Thunder promotion which resulted in additional DISH video and HSI subscribers. Network access expenses for 2009 increased $3.9 million, or 2%, to $225.9 million as compared to 2008 due to higher aspirational gift costs (e.g., personal computers), higher long distance carriage costs and additional data backbone costs. During 2008, we expensed $4.2 million of promotional costs for Master Card gift cards issued to new HSI customers entering into a two year price protection plan and to existing customers who purchased additional services under a two year price protection plan and $3.0 million for a flat screen television promotion. As we continue to offer aspirational gifts as part of our promotions, increase our sales of data products such as HSI and increase the penetration of our unlimited long distance calling plans, our network access expense may increase in the future.

Wage and benefit expenses for our Frontier legacy operations increased $7.4 million, or 2%, to $415.3 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to higher compensation costs, as 2009 costs were reduced by the Companys furlough plan, and 2010 reflects higher benefit costs, primarily from restricted stock awards. Wage and benefit expenses for 2009 increased $8.6 million, or 2%, to $407.9 million as compared to 2008, primarily due to higher pension costs of $34.0 million, mostly offset by headcount reductions, decreases in compensation, lower severance and early retirement costs, reduced overtime costs and lower benefit expenses. Pension costs are included in our wage and benefit expenses. The decline in the value of our pension plan assets during 2008 resulted in an increase in our pension expense in 2009 and 2010. Pension costs for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $38.0 million, $34.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Pension costs include pension expense of $46.3 million and $41.7 million, less amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures of $8.3 million and $7.5 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. 43 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES In connection with the completion of the Merger on July 1, 2010, certain employees were transferred from various Verizon pension plans into 12 pension plans that were then merged with the Frontier Communications Pension Plan (the Plan) effective August 31, 2010. Assets of $581.3 million, including approximately $142.5 million that represents a receivable of the Plan as of December 31, 2010, were transferred into the Plan during the second half of 2010, with the receivable to be settled by the transfer of assets by the end of the third quarter of 2011. The Companys pension plan assets have increased from $608.6 million at December 31, 2009 to $1,290.3 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $681.7 million, or 112%. This increase is a result of asset transfers from the Verizon pension plan trusts of $581.3 million, as described above, less ongoing benefit payments of $67.3 million, offset by $154.6 million of positive investment returns and cash contributions of $13.1 million during 2010. Based on current assumptions and plan asset values, we estimate that our 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit expenses (which were $68.4 million in 2010 before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures) will be approximately $70 million to $80 million for Frontier before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures, including the plan expenses of the Acquired Business for 2011. No contributions were made to Frontiers pension plan during 2008 or 2009. We expect that we will make cash contributions to our pension plan of approximately $50 million in 2011. All other operating expenses All other operating expenses for 2010 increased $434.2 million, or 116%, to $807.4 million, as compared with 2009. All other operating expenses for 2010 increased $459.8 million as a result of the Acquired Business. All other operating expenses for our Frontier legacy operations decreased $25.5 million, or 7%, to $347.6 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to $29.2 million in corporate costs allocated to the Acquired Business, partially offset by higher USF surcharges, higher electricity and fuel costs, and higher travel costs incurred in connection with the Acquired Business. All other operating expenses for 2009 decreased $38.3 million, or 9%, to $373.2 million as compared to 2008, due to reduced costs for outside contractors and other vendors, as well as lower fuel, travel and USF surcharges, partially offset by slightly higher marketing expenses.

Depreciation and amortization expense for 2010 increased $417.3 million, or 88%, to $893.7 million, as compared with 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2010 increased $495.0 million as a result of the Acquired Business. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Frontier legacy operations decreased $77.5 million, or 16%, to $398.9 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to reduced amortization expense, as discussed below, and a declining net asset base, partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. We annually commission an independent study to update the estimated remaining useful lives of our plant assets. We revised our useful lives for Frontier legacy plant assets, and the plant assets of the Acquired Business, based on the study effective October 1, 2010. The c omposite depreciation rate for our plant assets is 7.6% as a result of the study. We anticipate depreciation expense of approximately $820 million to $840 million and amortization expense of approximately $510 million for 2011 for Frontier, including the Acquired Business. Amortization expense for 2010 included $237.8 million for intangible assets (primarily customer base) that were acquired in the Transaction based on an estimated fair value of $2.5 billion and an estimated useful life of nine years for the residential customer list and 12 years for the business customer list, amortized on an accelerated method. 44 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Depreciation and amortization expense for 2009 decreased $85.4 million, or 15%, to $476.4 million as compared to 2008. The decrease is primarily due to reduced amortization expense, as discussed below, and a declining net asset base, partially offset by changes in the remaining useful lives of certain assets. Amortization expense for 2009 is comprised of $57.9 million for amortization associated with certain Frontier legacy properties, which were fully amortized in June 2009, and $56.3 million for intangible assets (customer base and trade name) that were acquired in the acquisitions of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, Inc., Global Valley Networks, Inc. and GVN Services. Amortization expense for certain other Frontier legacy properties was $126.4 million for 2008.

The Company incurred operating expenses, including deal costs, of approximately $135.6 million and capital expenditures of approximately $90.6 million in 2010 related to these integration initiatives in Phase 1. The Company continues to engage in activities to enable the Company to implement its go to market strategy in its new markets and to complete the conversions of all the remaining systems into one platform (Phase 2). The Company incurred operating expenses and capital expenditures of $1.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, in 2010 related to the commencement of these Phase 2 initiatives. The Company currently expects to incur operating expenses and capital expenditures of approximately $90 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2011 related to these Phase 2 initiatives.

Investment income for 2009 declined $9.8 million, or 61%, to $6.3 million as compared with 2008 primarily due to reduced equity earnings of $4.2 million and a decrease of $5.6 million in income from short term investments of cash and cash equivalents, as higher cash balances were more than offset by significantly lower short term investment rates. Our average cash balances were $304.7 million, $318.0 million and $177.5 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other Income (Loss), net Other income (loss), net for 2010 improved $54.8 million to $13.7 million as compared with 2009, primarily due to the loss on early retirement of debt of $45.9 million recognized in 2009. 2010 reflects a $4.5 million gain on a life insurance policy settlement and an increase of $2.2 million in settlement of customer advances. Other income (loss), net for 2009 declined $36.0 million to $(41.1) million as compared with 2008, primarily due to premiums paid on the early retirement of debt of $45.9 million in 2009, partially offset by increased litigation settlement proceeds of $3.8 million. 45 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Interest Expense Interest expense for 2010 increased $143.6 million, or 38%, to $521.8 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to higher average debt levels in 2010. Interest expense for 2010 included $143.2 million associated with the assumed debt from the Transaction. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 8.04% and 7.85%, respectively. Interest expense for 2009 increased $15.6 million, or 4%, to $378.2 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to higher average debt levels and interest rates in 2009. Our composite average borrowing rate as of December 31, 2009 as compared with the prior year was 31 basis points higher, increasing from 7.54% to 7.85%. Our average debt outstanding was $6,950.9 million, $4,867.2 million and $4,753.0 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our debt levels have risen due to the $3,450.0 million of debt that was assumed by Frontier upon consummation of the Transaction. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for 2010 increased $45.1 million, or 64%, to $115.0 million as compared with 2009, primarily due to higher taxable income as a result of the Acquired Business. The effective tax rate for 2010 was 42.5% as compared with 36.2% for 2009 and 36.6% for 2008. In the third quarter of 2010, Frontier wrote off certain deferred tax assets of approximately $11.3 million related to Merger transaction costs which were not tax deductible. Prior to the closing of the Merger, these costs were deemed to be tax deductible as the Transaction had not yet been successfully completed. These costs were incurred to facilitate the Merger and once the Merger closed, these costs must be capitalized for tax purposes. The results for 2010 also include the impact of a $4.1 million charge resulting from health care reform legislation associated with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Acts), partially offset by a relea se of $0.9 million in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions and the permanent difference on a split dollar life insurance policy settlement for $1.6 million. The health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010 under the Acts has eliminated the tax deduction for the subsidy that the Company receives under Medicare Part D for prescription drug costs. The amount of our uncertain tax positions expected to reverse during the next twelve months and which would affect our effective tax rate is $23.2 million as of December 31, 2010. We paid $19.9 million in cash taxes during 2010, as compared to $59.7 million and $78.9 million in cash taxes paid in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect that our cash taxes for 2011 will be approximately $50 million to $75 million, which includes the impact of bonus depreciation in accordance with the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Income tax expense for 2009 decreased $36.6 million, or 34%, to $69.9 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to lower taxable income arising from lower operating income, lower investment income and loss on debt repurchases. The second quarter of 2008 included a reduction in income tax expense of $7.5 million that resulted from the expiration of certain statute of limitations on April 15, 2008. Refunds of approximately $56.2 million were applied for in the Companys 2008 tax returns and received in 2010. The refunds resulted from a tax methods change applied for during the third quarter of 2009. Refunds are recorded on our balance sheet at December 31, 2009 in current assets within Income taxes and other current assets. Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for 2010 was $152.7 million, or $0.23 per share, as compared to $120.8 million, or $0.38 per share, in 2009 and $182.7 million, or $0.57 per share, in 2008. The increase in 2010 net income is primarily the result of incremental operating income from the Acquired Business, partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense. The change in basic and diluted net income per share was primarily due to the increase in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of 678.5 million shares in connection with our acquisition of the Acquired Business. 46 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows: Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio. Our long term debt as of December 31, 2010 was approximately 97% fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes. We had no interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt in effect at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, all but $275.3 million of our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2010 have fixed interest rates. In addition, our undrawn $750.0 million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with LIBOR, as defined. Consequently, we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2010, a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure At December 31, 2010, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately $8.4 billion, based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of 8.04% and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately 10 years. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations has been reduced from the weighted average maturity as of December 31, 2009 by approximately 2.0 years due to the $3.45 billion of debt that was assumed by Frontier upon consummation of the Transaction. Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of December 31, 2010 is limited to our pension assets. We have no other security investments of any material amount. During 2008 and 2009, the diminished availability of credit and liquidity in the United States and throughout the global financial system resulted in substantial volatility in financial markets and the banking system. These and other economic events have had an adverse impact on investment portfolios. The decline in the value of our pension plan assets during 2008 resulted in an increase in our pension expense in 2009 and 2010. The Companys pension plan assets have increased from $608.6 million at December 31, 2009 to $1,290.3 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $681.7 million, or 112%. This increase is a result of asset transfers from the Verizon pension plan trusts of $581.3 million, including approximately $142.5 million that represents a receivable of the Plan as of December 31, 2010, less ongoing benefit payments of $67.3 million, offset by $154.6 million of positive investment returns and cash contributions of $13.1 million during 2010. We expect that we will make cash contributions to our pension plan of approximately $50 million in 2011. 47 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
