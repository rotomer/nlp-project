ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are an energy services holding company whose principal business is the distribution of natural gas in six states Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, Tennessee and Virginia. Our six utilities serve more than 2.2 million end use customers, making us the largest distributor of natural gas in the southeastern and mid Atlantic regions of the United States based on customer count. We are involved in various related businesses, including retail natural gas marketing to end use customers primarily in Georgia; natural gas asset management and related logistics activities for our own utilities as well as for nonaffiliated companies; natural gas storage arbitrage and related activities; and the development and operation of high deliverability underground natural gas storage assets. We also own and operate a small telecommunications business that constructs and operates conduit and fiber infrastructure within select metropolitan areas. We manage these businesses through four operating segments distribution operations, retail energy operations, wholesale services and energy investments and a nonoperating corporate segment. As of December 31, 2006, we employed a total of 2,369 employees across these five segments. The distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the six states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders. With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Our non Georgia jurisdictions have various regulatory mechanisms to provide us with a reasonable opportunity to recover our costs, but these methods of recovery are not direct offsets to the potential impacts on earnings. Atlanta Gas Light charges rates to its customers primarily as monthly fixed charges. Our retail energy operations segment, which consists of SouthStar, also is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to mitigate potential weather impacts. Our Sequent subsidiary within our wholesale services segment is weather sensitive, with increased earnings opportunities, as well as increased loss potential, during periods of extreme weather conditions, which typically produce greater price volatility. Our energy investments segments primary business is our natural gas storage, which develops, acquires and operates high deliverability salt dome storage assets in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. While this business also can generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, the majority of our storage services are covered under medium to long term contracts at a fixed market rate. 2006 Business Highlights We achieved several significant milestones during 2006 that position us well for future growth and for providing long term value to our shareholders. We completed our rate proceeding in Virginia, which resulted in a five year rate freeze for customers under the first performance based rate (PBR) plan approved in that state for a natural gas utility. As part of the settlement reached with the parties in the case, we have committed to spend approximately $48 million to $60 million to build a new pipeline that will improve access to natural gas in certain areas we serve in Virginia, particularly during critical peak periods. Also, the Virginia Commission approved a permanent WNA for residential customers as part of the settlement. We successfully resolved our rate proceeding in Tennessee, which resulted in a $3 million base rate increase effective January 1, 2007 to offset higher costs and lower natural gas consumption. Additionally, the rate proceeding improved our authorized return and improved our capital structure (55% debt and 45% equity) in a manner that is more consistent with our utilities and other non affiliated utilities. We continued to grow our asset management business at Sequent, which enables them to generate greater levels of economic value during periods of market volatility. We expanded, through SouthStar, our retail footprint into the Ohio and Florida markets. We announced our intention to develop a 12 Bcf natural gas salt dome storage facility, known as Golden Triangle Storage, in Beaumont, Texas, at a capital cost of approximately $180 million. The project will provide high deliverability Gulf Coast storage at a key market point, with the first phase scheduled to be in commercial operation in 2010. 20 Table of Contents 2006 Business Results In 2006, we earned $212 million in net income or $2.72 per diluted share, compared with net income of $193 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, in 2005. The 10% increase in net income was the result of a variety of factors: Our distribution operations segments EBIT improved by $11 million or 4% in 2006 as compared to 2005. We continued to benefit from the improved operating metrics of the utilities we acquired in 2004. These results were offset, however, by customer consumption declines due to warmer than normal weather throughout the year and high natural gas prices, particularly during the first quarter of 2006. Our retail energy operations segment provided stable year over year earnings contributions despite the effects of declining customer consumption, warmer weather and a lower of weighted average cost or current market price (LOCOM) adjustment to inventory. This segments marketing efforts during the year also resulted in a slight increase in customer count. Our wholesale services segment captured significant arbitrage opportunities due to price volatility and periods of extreme weather conditions. As a result, this segments EBIT contribution of $90 million was $41 million higher than in 2005, primarily as a result of additional commercial activity and storage arbitrage opportunities throughout the year, as well as the recognition of hedge gains as forward NYMEX prices declined. Our energy investments segment made progress on the evaluation and development of several projects during 2006. While these projects are expected to provide future earnings contributions, the associated business development expenses resulted in a lower year over year performance in this segment as well as the disposition in the second half of 2005 of certain non strategic assets acquired as part of the acquisition of NUI in December 2004. Our interest expense for 2006 increased $14 million as compared to 2005. The increase reflects higher carrying costs associated with higher inventory storage balances, as well as higher short term interest rates, relative to the prior year. Results of Operations AGL Resources Revenues We generate nearly all our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. We include in our consolidated revenues an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed, to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. Operating Margin and EBIT We evaluate the performance of our operating segments using the measures of operating margin and EBIT. We believe operating margin is a better indicator than revenues for the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of gas can vary significantly and is generally passed directly to our customers. We also consider operating margin to be a better indicator in our retail energy operations, wholesale services and energy investments segments since it is a direct measure of gross profit before overhead costs. We believe EBIT is a useful measurement of our operating segments performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective, exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes, neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations. Our operating margin and EBIT are not measures that are considered to be calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). You should not consider operating margin or EBIT an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, our operating performance than operating income or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin or EBIT measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our operating margin and EBIT to our operating income and net income, together with other consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 21 Table of Contents In millions 2006 2005 2004 Operating revenues $ 2,621 $ 2,718 $ 1,832 Cost of gas 1,482 1,626 995 Operating margin 1,139 1,092 837 Operating expenses Operation and maintenance 473 477 377 Depreciation and amortization 138 133 99 Taxes other than income 40 40 29 Total operating expenses 651 650 505 Operating income 488 442 332 Other expenses (1 ) (1 ) Minority interest (23 ) (22 ) (18 ) EBIT 464 419 314 Interest expense 123 109 71 Earnings before income taxes 341 310 243 Income taxes 129 117 90 Net income $ 212 $ 193 $ 153 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 2.73 $ 2.50 $ 2.30 Diluted $ 2.72 $ 2.48 $ 2.28 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 77.6 77.3 66.3 Diluted 78.0 77.8 67.0 Segment information Operating revenues, operating margin, operating expenses and EBIT information for each of our segments are presented in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: In millions Operating revenues Operating margin (1) Operating expenses EBIT (1) 2006 Distribution operations $ 1,624 $ 807 $ 499 $ 310 Retail energy operations 930 156 68 63 Wholesale services 182 139 49 90 Energy investments 41 36 26 10 Corporate (2) (156 ) 1 9 (9 ) Consolidated $ 2,621 $ 1,139 $ 651 $ 464 2005 Distribution operations $ 1,753 $ 814 $ 518 $ 299 Retail energy operations 996 146 61 63 Wholesale services 95 92 42 49 Energy investments 56 40 23 19 Corporate (2) (182 ) 6 (11 ) Consolidated $ 2,718 $ 1,092 $ 650 $ 419 2004 Distribution operations $ 1,111 $ 640 $ 394 $ 247 Retail energy operations 827 132 62 52 Wholesale services 54 53 29 24 Energy investments 25 13 8 7 Corporate (2) (185 ) (1 ) 12 (16 ) Consolidated $ 1,832 $ 837 $ 505 $ 314 (1) These are non GAAP measurements.

Wholesale services EBIT improvement of $41 million primarily reflected the recognition of hedge gains during 2006, as forward NYMEX prices declined significantly. In contrast, NYMEX price increases experienced during 2005 had the opposite effect, but to a lesser extent. In the distribution operations segment, EBIT improved by $11 million, and operating margin declined $7 million offset primarily by reduced operating expenses of $19 million. Our retail energy operations segments EBIT was flat compared to 2005. The energy investments segments EBIT was down $9 million primarily due to the loss of EBIT contributions as the result of the sale in 2005 of certain assets that were originally acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI. Our operating margin increased $47 million or 4% from 2005. The following table indicates the significant changes in our operating margin: In millions Operating margin for 2005 $ 1,092 Net change in the fair value of hedges at wholesale services 60 Increased operating margins at retail energy operations 16 Increased wholesale services commercial activities 5 Wholesale services inventory LOCOM adjustments (net of hedging recoveries) (18 ) Retail energy operations inventory LOCOM adjustments (6 ) Lower operating margins at distribution operations utilities (7 ) Loss of margin from energy investment assets sold in 2005 (9 ) Other 6 Operating margin for 2006 $ 1,139 Changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of our operations to earnings variability. Our nonutility businesses principally use physical and financial arrangements to economically hedge the risks associated with both weather related seasonal fluctuations and changing commodity prices. In addition, because these economic hedges are generally not designated for hedge accounting treatment, our reported earnings for the wholesale services and retail energy operations segments reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating margin or our other comprehensive income (OCI) for those derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as accounting hedges. Forward NYMEX prices decreased during 2006, especially during the third and fourth quarters. This resulted in the wholesale services segment recognizing $41 million of storage hedge gains in 2006, compared to the recognition of $7 million of storage hedge losses in 2005. In addition, wholesale services recognized $12 million in gains associated with the financial instruments used to hedge its transportation capacity. Consequently, wholesale services experienced a net change of $60 million from its hedging activities for 2006 compared to 2005. The results of the wholesale services segment also reflect improved commercial activities of approximately $5 million. Sequent was able to capture higher seasonal storage margins in 2006 and additional operating margin opportunities brought on by higher temperatures during the late summer months. This offset the lower operating margins that resulted from milder weather earlier in the year. As a result of decreasing NYMEX prices, the wholesale services segment evaluated the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventory and recorded LOCOM adjustments totaling $43 million during 2006; however, as inventory was physically withdrawn from storage during the year, $22 million of the 2006 adjustments were recovered and reflected in 2006 operating revenues when the original economic results were realized as the related hedging derivatives were settled. We experienced increased operating margins at our retail energy operations segment of $10 million driven by improved retail margins of $6 million and slightly higher storage and commercial margins of $4 million. Storage and commercial margins were driven by improved optimization of storage and transportation assets and effective commodity risk management, including net gains on weather derivatives offset by a $6 million adjustment in 2006 to reduce inventory to market for which no LOCOM adjustment was recorded in 2005. Retail operating margins increased due to improved retail price spreads and an increase in the average number of customers offset by lower customer consumption due to weather that was more than 10% warmer than the previous year and lower late payment fees of $1 million due to an increase in the number of customers utilizing payment arrangements. 23 Table of Contents Operating margin for the distribution operations segment decreased $7 million primarily from warmer weather affecting customer usage and from our exiting the New Jersey and Florida appliance businesses. The margin at Elizabethtown Gas decreased $3 million with 18% warmer weather than in 2005. Virginia Natural Gas margin decreased $4 million with 17% warmer weather, and the margin at Florida City Gas decreased $2 million with 16% warmer weather. Further, our exiting from the New Jersey and Florida appliance businesses reduced margin by $3 million. This margin reduction was partially offset by increased margin at Atlanta Gas Light of $6 million primarily from gas storage carrying costs from higher average inventory balances and pipeline replacement program revenues from the continuing expenditures under the program. Our energy investments segment operating margin decreased $4 million due to the loss of contributions from certain assets we acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI, but later sold in 2005. Our operating expenses increased $1 million or 0.2% from the same period in 2005. The following table sets forth the significant components of operating expenses: In millions Operating expenses for 2005 $ 650 Increased depreciation and amortization 5 Increased payroll, incentive compensation and corporate overhead allocated costs at wholesale services 7 Increased bad debt expenses at retail energy operations and distribution operations 4 Lower expenses resulting from energy investment assets sold in 2005 (8 ) Lower expenses at distribution operations related to workforce and facilities restructurings in 2005 and 2006 (15 ) Other 8 Operating expenses for 2006 $ 651 The wholesale services segment recorded $7 million of additional costs associated with payroll due to an increased number of employees to support growth and increased incentive compensation, which is generally based on Sequents operating performance. Bad debt expense for 2006 increased over 2005 primarily in our retail energy operations segment. The retail energy operations bad debt for 2006 was $13 million, a $3 million increase from the same period in 2005, driven by an increase in the number of accounts receivable balances past due more than 60 days due to higher natural gas bills. These increases were offset by $15 million in lower costs primarily related to a 2005 restructuring at the distribution operations segment, as a result of a reduction in the workforce and elimination of unnecessary facilities following the 2004 acquisition of NUI. An additional $8 million decrease in operating expenses was related to the operation of assets, primarily in the energy investments segment, that were originally acquired in the 2004 acquisition of NUI and later sold in 2005. Interest expense for 2006 increased by $14 million or 13% as compared to 2005. As indicated in the following table, higher short term interest rates and higher debt outstanding combined to increase our interest expense in 2006 relative to the previous year. The increase of $200 million in average debt outstanding for 2006 compared to 2005 was due to additional debt incurred as a result of higher working capital requirements. In millions 2006 2005 Total interest expense $ 123 $ 109 Average debt outstanding (1) 2,023 1,823 Average interest rate 6.1 % 6.0 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. Based on $733 million of variable rate debt, which includes $527 million of variable rate short term debt, $100 million of variable rate senior notes and $106 million of variable rate gas facility revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point change in market interest rates from 5% to 6% would result in an increase in annual pretax interest expense of $7 million. The increase in income tax expense of $12 million or 10% for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected additional income taxes primarily due to higher corporate earnings year over year. We expect our effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2007, to be similar to the effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2006. 2005 compared to 2004 Consolidated EBIT for 2005 increased by $105 million or 33% from the previous year, of which $56 million related to EBIT contributions from the 2004 acquisitions of NUI and Jefferson Island Storage & Hub, LLC (Jefferson Island) and from Pivotal Propane of Virginia, Inc. (Pivotal Propane) which became operational in 2005. The increase further reflected increased contributions of $8 million from Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations, $11 million from retail energy operations and $3 million from AGL Networks, LLC (AGL Networks) in energy investments. Wholesale services EBIT increased $25 million primarily due to increased operating margins partially offset by higher operating expenses. Corporate segment results improved by $5 million compared to 2004, primarily due to merger and acquisition related costs incurred in 2004 but not in 2005. 24 Table of Contents Our operating margin in 2005 increased $255 million or 30% from 2004. The following table indicates the significant changes in our operating margin: In millions Operating margin in 2004 $ 837 Increased operating margin at distribution operations from acquired utilities 167 Increased wholesale services commercial activities 53 Increased operating margins at retail energy operations 14 Increased operating margins at Jefferson Island 13 Operating margin from energy investment assets acquired from NUI Corp. 8 Increased operating margin at distribution operations, primarily Atlanta Gas Light 7 Increased operating margins at Pivotal Propane and AGL Networks 7 Inventory LOCOM adjustments at wholesale services (2 ) Net change in the fair value of hedges at wholesale services (12 ) Operating margin in 2005 $ 1,092 The increase primarily reflects the NUI and Jefferson Island acquisitions and completion of the Pivotal Propane facility in Virginia, as well as improved margins at SouthStar, Sequent and AGL Networks. Excluding the addition of the NUI utilities, distribution operations margins improved by $7 million mainly as a result of higher pipeline replacement revenues and additional carrying costs charged to Marketers for gas storage. Retail energy operations margins increased $14 million, due primarily to higher commodity margins. Wholesale services operating margin increased $39 million year over year, primarily due to significant market volatility following the hurricane activity during the third quarter and the continuing volatile market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2005. Energy investments margins were up $27 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Jefferson Island that contributed $13 million, contributions from NUIs nonutility businesses of $8 million, contribution from Pivotal Propane of $3 million and improved operating margin at AGL Networks of $4 million. Our operating expenses increased $145 million or 29% from 2004. The following table sets forth the significant changes in our operating expenses: In millions Operating expenses in 2004 $ 505 Operating expenses at distribution operations from NUI utilities acquired December 2004 125 Increased operating expenses at wholesale services, primarily payroll, incentive compensation and depreciation 13 Operating expenses at energy investments from NUI acquired assets 8 Operating expenses at Jefferson Island 3 Operating expenses at energy investments from Pivotal Propane 3 Other (7 ) Operating expenses in 2005 $ 650 The increase was primarily a result of $124 million in higher expenses at distribution operations due to the addition of NUI. In addition, operating expenses at energy investments increased $15 million primarily due to the addition of Jefferson Island, the NUI nonutility assets and Pivotal Propane. Operating expenses at wholesale services increased $13 million due to increased payroll and employee incentive compensation costs resulting from its operational and financial growth and depreciation on a trading and risk management system placed in service during 2004. The increased operating expenses were offset by lower corporate operating expenses primarily due to prior year costs incurred with merger and acquisition activities. Interest expense for 2005 increased by $38 million or 54% as compared to 2004. As indicated in the table below, higher short term interest rates and higher average debt outstanding combined to increase our interest expense in 2005 relative to the previous year. The increase of $549 million in average debt outstanding for 2005 was due to additional debt incurred as a result of the acquisitions of NUI and Jefferson Island and higher working capital requirements as a result of higher natural gas prices. In millions 2005 2004 Total interest expense $ 109 $ 71 Average debt outstanding (1) 1,823 1,274 Average interest rate 6.0 % 5.6 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. The increase in income tax expense of $27 million or 30% for 2005 compared to 2004 reflected additional income taxes of $25 million due to higher corporate earnings year over year and $2 million due to a slightly higher effective tax rate of 38% for 2005 as compared to 37% in 2004. 25 Table of Contents Distribution Operations Distribution operations includes our six natural gas local distribution utility companies that construct, manage and maintain intrastate natural gas pipelines and distribution facilities and serve more than 2.2 million end use customers.

The measure of degree days for a given day is the mean daily temperature (average of the daily high and low temperature) and a baseline temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Heating degree days result when the mean daily temperature is less than the 65 degree baseline. Generally, increased heating degree days result in greater demand for gas on our distribution systems. (3) Estimate based on principles consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction. Returns are not necessarily consistent with GAAP returns. (4) Estimated based on 13 month average. (5) The authorized return on rate base, return on equity, and percentage of equity reflected above were those authorized as of December 31, 2006. Effective January 1, 2007, Chattanooga Gas authorized return on rate base, return on equity and percentage of equity are 7.89%, 10.2% and 44.8%, respectively, due to the results of its base rate case settled in December 2006. (6) Includes amounts for the full year of 2004; however, we acquired these utilities in December 2004. The December 2004 end use customers for Elizabethtown Gas was 266 and 103 for Florida City Gas, December 2004 distribution for Elizabethtown Gas was 8.2 and 0.9 for Florida City Gas; and December 2004 heating degree days for Elizabethtown Gas was 873 and 239 for Florida City Gas. (7) Includes distribution and transmission main only. Regulatory Environment Each utility operates subject to regulations provided by the state regulatory agency in its service territories with respect to rates charged to our customers and various service and safety matters. Rates charged to our customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. Rates are set at levels that allow recovery of all prudently incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable return on common equity. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of utility plant in service, working capital, inventories and certain other assets; less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, net deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions. Our utilities are authorized to use a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanism that allows them to automatically adjust their rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and to ensure the utilities recover 100% of the costs incurred in purchasing gas for their customers. We continuously monitor the performance of our utilities to determine whether rates need to be further adjusted through a rate case filing. Straight Fixed Variable Rates Atlanta Gas Light recognizes revenue under a straight fixed variable rate design whereby Atlanta Gas Light charges rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges, however the Marketers bill these charges directly to their customers. This mechanism minimizes the seasonality of revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric and the monthly charge is not set to be directly weather dependent. Weather indirectly influences the number of customers that have active accounts during the heating season, and this has a seasonal impact on Atlanta Gas Lights revenues since generally more customers are connected in periods of colder weather than in periods of warmer weather. 27 Table of Contents Weather Normalization The tariffs of Elizabethtown Gas, Virginia Natural Gas, and Chattanooga Gas contain WNA provisions that are designed to help stabilize operating margin results by increasing base rate amounts charged to customers when weather is warmer than normal and decreasing amounts charged when weather is colder than normal. The WNA is most effective in a reasonable temperature range relative to normal weather using historical averages. For Elizabethtown Gas, the weather normalization provision was renewed in October 2004 and is based on a 20 year average of weather conditions. Virginia Natural Gas received from the Virginia Commission approval of a weather normalization program in September 2002 as a two year experiment involving the use of special rates. In September 2004, Virginia Natural Gas received approval from the Virginia Commission to extend the WNA program for an additional two years with certain modifications to the existing program. The modifications included removal of the commercial class of customers from the WNA program and the use of a rolling 30 year average to calculate the weather factor that is updated annually. The residential WNA program was made permanent by Virginia Commission order in September 2006. Chattanooga Gas base rates include a weather normalization provision that allows for revenue to be recognized based on a factor derived from average temperatures over a 30 year period, which offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on its operating income. Rate Settlement Agreements On July 24, 2006, the Virginia Commission issued an order approving Virginia Natural Gas PBR plan with modifications. Under the PBR rate plan, Virginia Natural Gas rates were frozen as an incentive for it to promote cost containment, productivity and rate stability without traditional rate proceedings that set rates based on investment, return and cost of service. These modifications include a requirement to construct and report on the progress of a pipeline connecting Virginia Natural Gas northern and southern systems and reporting requirements to monitor compliance with the terms of the PBR plan. Virginia Natural Gas accepted the terms of the PBR plan as modified by the Virginia Commission in August 2006. The modified PBR plan was effective August 1, 2006 with base rates frozen at current levels for five years. The estimated cost to construct the pipeline is between $48 million and $60 million, and the pipeline is expected to be completed in 2009. On June 30, 2006, we filed a general rate case with the Tennessee Commission seeking approximately $6 million in increased annual base rates to cover the rising cost of service at Chattanooga Gas. Our rate case included a proposal for comprehensive rate design, including an energy conservation program (ECP) and a conservation and usage adjustment (CUA). The ECP would provide incentives for customers to reduce their natural gas consumption by offering rebates for more energy efficient appliances and to help customers better manage their energy costs. The CUA is designed to mitigate the financial impact on Chattanooga Gas of expected increased energy conservation by customers through rate adjustments. The Tennessee Commission divided the case into two phases: one phase to examine the revenue requirements and traditional rate design issues and a second phase to review the CUA and ECP. Approximately $5 million of our base rate request was related to the revenue requirement. In December 2006, the Tennessee Commission approved a settlement agreement between Chattanooga Gas, the Consumer Advocate and Protection Division of the Attorney Generals Office (Consumer Advocate) and the Chattanooga Manufacturers Association settling the revenue requirements and traditional rate design issues of the case. The settlement agreement was effective January 1, 2007 and provides for a base rate increase of approximately $3 million of which $2 million will be an increase in operating margin and the remaining will be a $1 million shift from WNA to base rates and have no overall impact on operating margin. The settlement agreement establishes and authorized return on equity of 10.2% for Chattanooga Gas, resulting in an overall authorized rate of return of 7.89%. Prior to the settlement agreement, Chattanooga Gas authorized return on equity was 10.2% and its overall authorized rate of return was set at 7.43%. The second phase of the case is scheduled to begin in February 2007 with a final ruling expected by September 30, 2007. Customer Demand Our distribution operations businesses face competition based on customer preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products. Our principal competition relates to electric utilities and oil and propane providers serving the residential and commercial markets throughout our service areas primarily through the potential displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances. The primary competitive factors are the prices for competing sources of energy and the desirability of natural gas heating versus alternative heating sources. 28 Table of Contents Competition for space heating and general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including: changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy general economic conditions energy conservation legislation and regulations the capability to convert from natural gas to alternative fuels weather new housing starts In some of our service areas, net growth continues to be slowed due to the number of customers who leave our systems because of higher natural gas prices and competition from alternative fuel sources, including incentives offered by the local electric utilities to switch to electric heat alternatives. We expect customer growth to improve in the future through our efforts to obtain new customers and retain existing customers. These efforts include working to add residential customers, multifamily complexes and high value commercial customers that use natural gas for purposes other than space heating. In addition, we partner with numerous entities to market the benefits of gas appliances and to identify potential retention options early in the process for those customers who might consider converting to alternative fuels. Collective Bargaining Agreements In 2006, a collective bargaining agreement representing approximately 300 Atlanta Gas Light employees by Teamsters Local 528 was not renewed. As a result, these employees are no longer represented by a bargaining unit and now fall under our standard human resources pay and benefit plans and policies. In January 2007, a majority of Chattanooga Gas bargaining unit employees submitted a petition to Chattanooga Gas requesting the decertification of the Utility Workers Union of America, Local 461, as their bargaining representative. Based on that majority showing, Chattanooga Gas filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board requesting that the Board conduct a decertification election.The decertification election is currently scheduled to take place on February 16, 2007. The following table provides information about the collective bargaining agreements to which our natural gas local distribution utilities are parties: Affiliated subsidiary Approximate # of employees Date of contract expiration Communications Workers of America (Local No. 1023) Elizabethtown Gas 8 April 2007 Utility Workers Union of America (Local No. 461) Chattanooga Gas 21 April 2007 International Union of Operating Engineers (Local No. 474) Atlanta Gas Light 26 August 2007 Teamsters (Local Nos. 769 and 385) Florida City Gas 50 March 2008 Utility Workers Union of America (Local No. 424) Elizabethtown Gas 160 November 2009 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (Local No. 50) Virginia Natural Gas 141 May 2010 Total 406 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents results of operations for distribution operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Operating revenues $ 1,624 $ 1,753 $ 1,111 Cost of gas 817 939 471 Operating margin (1) 807 814 640 Operating expenses 499 518 394 Operating income 308 296 246 Other income 2 3 1 EBIT (1) $ 310 $ 299 $ 247 Metrics (2) Average end use customers (in thousands) 2,250 2,242 1,880 Operation and maintenance expenses per customer $ 156 $ 166 $ 152 EBIT per customer $ 138 $ 133 $ 131 (1) These are non GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of operating margin and EBIT to our operating income and net income is contained in Results of Operations AGL Resources. (2) 2004 metrics include only December for Florida City Gas, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. 2006 compared to 2005 EBIT increased $11 million or 4% in 2006 reflecting a decrease in operating expenses of $19 million, partially offset by decreased operating margin of $7 million. The operating margin decrease of $7 million or 1% in 2006 was primarily the result of lower usage resulting from customer conservation and warmer weather. Operating margins decreased $4 million at Virginia Natural Gas, $3 million at Elizabethtown Gas and $2 million at Florida City Gas. Also contributing to the decrease was a $3 million decrease due to our exit from the New Jersey and Florida appliance business operations in 2005. These decreases were offset by a net increase in Atlanta Gas Lights operating margin of $6 million consisting of $5 million in gas storage carrying costs and $2 million in pipeline replacement program (PRP) revenues, offset primarily by $2 million as a result of the effect of the Georgia Commissions June 2005 Rate Order. Operating expenses decreased $19 million or 4% in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005, primarily due to lower compensation and facilities expense of $10 million, resulting from a workforce and facilities restructuring in 2005, $5 million of reduced outside services and $3 million in lower costs due to our exiting the appliance businesses acquired with our purchase of NUI. These decreases were offset by a $1 million increase in bad debt expense primarily at Elizabethtown Gas due to higher gas prices in 2006. Operating expenses also reflect a $2 million net gain compared to 2005 primarily due to the sale of properties in Georgia in 2006. 2005 compared to 2004 EBIT increased $52 million or 21% reflecting an increase in operating margin of $174 million, partially offset by increased operating expenses of $124 million. The businesses acquired from NUI on November 30, 2004 contributed approximately $50 million of EBIT in 2005 compared to $7 million in 2004. This was due to the inclusion of the full year NUI results in 2005 as compared to the inclusion of one month in 2004. The $174 million or 27% increase in operating margin was primarily due to the addition of NUIs operations, which contributed $167 million. The remainder was primarily due to $8 million of higher operating margin at Atlanta Gas Light. The increase at Atlanta Gas Light resulted primarily from higher PRP revenues of $6 million and higher revenue of $3 million from additional carrying charges to Marketers for gas stored, primarily due to higher gas prices. Atlanta Gas Light also had approximately $3 million of increased operating margin from net customer growth, which offset a $3 million decrease in operating revenues that resulted from the June 2005 Settlement Agreement with the Georgia Commission. Operating margin at Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas remained relatively flat compared to 2004. The $124 million or 31% increase in operating expenses primarily reflected the addition of NUIs operations which increased operating expenses by $125 million. Retail Energy Operations Our retail energy operations segment consists of SouthStar, a joint venture owned 70% by our subsidiary, Georgia Natural Gas Company, and 30% by Piedmont Natural Gas (Piedmont). SouthStar markets natural gas and related services to retail customers on an unregulated basis, principally in Georgia as well as to commercial and industrial customers in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. During 2006, SouthStar entered into agreements with customers in Ohio and Florida to supply natural gas starting in the fourth quarter of 2006. 30 Table of Contents The SouthStar executive committee, which acts as the governing board, is comprised of six members, three representatives from AGL Resources and three from Piedmont. Under the joint venture agreement, all significant management decisions require the unanimous approval of the SouthStar executive committee; accordingly, our 70% financial interest is considered to be noncontrolling. Although our ownership interest in the SouthStar partnership is 70%, SouthStars earnings are allocated 75% to us and 25% to Piedmont, under an amended and restated joint venture agreement executed in March 2004. Earnings related to customers in Ohio and Florida are allocated 70% to us and 30% to Piedmont. We record the earnings allocated to Piedmont as a minority interest in our consolidated statements of income, and we record Piedmonts portion of SouthStars capital as a minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets. Competition SouthStar competes with other energy marketers, including Marketers in Georgia, to provide natural gas and related services to customers in Georgia and the Southeast. Based on its market share, SouthStar is the largest Marketer of natural gas in Georgia, with average customers over the last three years in excess of 530,000. In addition, similar to distribution operations, SouthStar faces competition based on customer preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products. SouthStars principal competition for other non natural gas energy products relates to electric utilities and the potential displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances. This competition with other energy products has been exacerbated by price volatility in the wholesale natural gas commodity market and related significant increases in the cost of natural gas billed to SouthStars customers, especially during the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first and second quarters of 2006. Operating Margin SouthStar generates operating margin primarily in three ways. The first is through the sale of natural gas to retail customers in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, primarily in Georgia where SouthStar captures a spread between wholesale and retail natural gas prices. The second way is through the collection of monthly service fees and customer late payment fees. The combination of these two retail price components is evaluated by SouthStar to ensure such pricing is structured to cover related retail customer costs, such as bad debt expense, customer service and billing, and lost and unaccounted for gas, and to provide a reasonable profit, as well as being competitive to attract new customers and maintain market share. SouthStars operating margins are impacted by seasonal weather, natural gas prices, customer growth and SouthStars related market share in Georgia, which has historically been approximately 35%. SouthStar employs strategies to attract and retain a higher credit quality customer base. These strategies result not only in higher operating margin, as these customers tend to utilize higher volumes of natural gas, but also help to mitigate bad debt expense due to the higher credit quality of customers. The third way SouthStar generates margin is through its commercial operations of optimizing storage and transportation assets and effectively managing commodity risk, which enables SouthStar to maintain competitive retail prices and operating margins. SouthStar is allocated storage and pipeline capacity that is used to supply gas to its customers in Georgia. Through hedging transactions, SouthStar manages exposures arising from changing commodity prices using natural gas storage transactions to capture margin from natural gas pricing differences that occur over time. SouthStars risk management policies allow the use of derivative instruments for hedging and risk management purposes but prohibit the use of derivative instruments for speculative purposes. SouthStar accounts for its natural gas inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or current market price. SouthStar evaluates the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventories against market prices and determines whether any declines in market prices below the weighted average cost are other than temporary. For declines considered to be other than temporary, SouthStar records adjustments to cost of gas in our consolidated statement of income to reduce the weighted average cost of the natural gas inventory to the current market price. As of December 31, 2006, SouthStar recorded a LOCOM adjustment of $6 million. SouthStar did not record a LOCOM adjustment in 2005 or 2004. We have designated a portion of SouthStars derivative transactions as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). We record derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassify them into earnings in the same period as the underlying hedged item occurs and is recorded in earnings. We record any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset and are greater than the losses or gains on the hedged item, in cost of gas in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. We have not designated the remainder of SouthStars derivative instruments as hedges under SFAS 133 and, accordingly, we record changes in their fair value in earnings in the period of change. 31 Table of Contents SouthStar also enters into weather derivative instruments in order to preserve margins in the event of warmer than normal weather in the winter months. These contracts are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 02, Accounting for Weather Derivatives. The weather derivative contracts contain settlement provisions based on cumulative heating degree days for the covered periods. In September 2006, SouthStar entered into weather derivatives (swaps and options) for the current winter heating season. During 2006, SouthStar recorded net gains on these weather derivatives of approximately $5 million. These gains were largely offset by a corresponding loss of operating margin due to the warm weather the hedge was designed to protect against. Impact of Volatility in Natural Gas Prices SouthStars operating margin and EBIT from the sales of natural gas to retail customers were affected by lower average usage in part due to conservation and higher bad debt as a result of higher and more volatile natural gas prices during the 2005 2006 heating season. SouthStar was also affected when natural gas prices further declined at the end of 2006 resulting in a LOCOM adjustment to inventory. SouthStars operating margin and EBIT associated with the optimization of storage and transportation assets and commodity risk management during 2006 were affected by the decline in wholesale natural gas prices. In 2005, natural gas prices were significantly higher in part due to gas supply disruptions brought on by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. For derivatives not designated as hedges under SFAS 133, SouthStar generally records fair value losses as natural gas prices decrease and fair value gains as natural gas prices increase. SouthStars bad debt expense was $13 million for 2006, a $3 million increase from 2005. The increase in bad debt was impacted by an increase in the amount of accounts receivable balances past due more than 60 days and the expectation that a majority of these past due accounts will not be collected. In addition, $1 million of aged deposits were applied to SouthStars bad debt on a one time basis in 2005. SouthStar entered into payment arrangements with these customers in an effort to help customers pay their higher natural gas bills during the 2005 2006 heating season. We expect that SouthStars collection efforts will continue to help mitigate the overall impact of bad debt expense as a percentage of operating revenues, which were 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to approximately 1.1% (excluding the one time application of aged deposits) for the same period in 2005. We further believe that SouthStars higher credit quality customer base mitigates our exposure to higher bad debt expenses. SouthStar also has experienced lower average usage per customer during 2006, compared to the same period in 2005 due to a number of factors including warmer weather and the effects of customer conservation. Though these two factors have contributed to a $16 million unfavorable impact on operating margin, net of gains on weather derivatives, relative to wholesale prices and normalized temperatures. SouthStar achieved a net increase in operating margin of $10 million for 2006 compared to 2005. Ohio Retail Market In August 2006, SouthStar was awarded the right to supply approximately a total of 10 Bcf of natural gas to customers of Dominion East Ohio (Dominion Ohio) through August 2008 (approximately 5 Bcf/year). As part of this agreement, SouthStar will manage supply, transportation and storage of natural gas on behalf of Dominion Ohio. While we do not expect the Dominion Ohio agreement to materially impact our results of operations, SouthStars entrance into the Ohio market is part of its continued growth strategy. Results of Operations The following table presents results of operations for retail energy operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Operating revenues $ 930 $ 996 $ 827 Cost of gas 774 850 695 Operating margin (1) 156 146 132 Operating expenses 68 61 62 Operating income 88 85 70 Other expense (2 ) Minority interest (23 ) (22 ) (18 ) EBIT (1) $ 63 $ 63 $ 52 Metrics Georgia Market Average customers (in thousands) 533 531 533 Market share in Georgia 35 % 35 % 36 % Natural gas volumes (Bcf) 38 44 45 (1) These are non GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of operating margin and EBIT to our operating income and net income is contained in Results of Operations AGL Resources. 32 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 EBIT for 2006 was relatively flat as compared to 2005, driven by a $10 million increase in operating margin which was offset by a $7 million increase in operating expenses, a $2 million increase in other expense and a $1 million increase in minority interest due to the slightly higher operating income. Operating margin increased by $10 million or 7% driven by improved retail operating margins of $6 million and higher storage margin gains of $4 million. Retail operating margins increased due to improved retail spreads and an increase of approximately 2,000 average customers in 2006 compared to 2005, offset by lower customer consumption due to weather that was approximately 10% warmer than 2005 and conservation. Late payment fees were $1 million lower in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to more customers being on payment arrangements in 2006. Additionally, retail operating margins decreased compared to 2005 due to higher interruptible margins in 2005 driven by peaking sales during curtailments. Storage margins were driven by improved optimization of storage and transportation assets and effective commodity risk management including net gains on weather derivatives. Storage operating margins were impacted by an adjustment in 2006 of $6 million to reduce inventory to market for which no LOCOM adjustment was recorded in 2005. Operating expenses increased $7 million or 11% primarily due to higher bad debt expense of $3 million, increased depreciation of $1 million due to the implementation of system enhancements, higher outside service costs of $1 million principally driven by the current year implementation of a new energy trading and risk management (ETRM) system and $1 million from increases in other general corporate overhead costs. The retail energy operations segment made a $2 million charitable contribution in 2006. Minority interest increased $1 million as a result of increased operating income in 2006 compared to 2005. 2005 compared to 2004 The $11 million or 21% increase in EBIT for 2005 was driven by a $14 million increase in operating margin and a $1 million decrease in total operating expenses, offset by a $4 million increase in minority interest due to higher earnings. The $14 million or 11% increase in operating margin was primarily the result of higher commodity margins and positive margin captured with SouthStars storage assets, offset by lower customer usage and lower late payment fees relative to 2004. There was a slight decrease in operating expenses in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease was primarily due to $1 million in lower bad debt expense resulting from ongoing collection process improvements. Minority interest increased $4 million or 22% as a direct result of increased operating income in 2005 compared to 2004. Wholesale Services Wholesale services consists of Sequent, our subsidiary involved in asset management, transportation, storage, producer and peaking services and wholesale marketing. Our asset management business focuses on capturing economic value from idle or underutilized natural gas assets, which are typically amassed by companies via investments in or contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets. Margin is typically created in this business by participating in transactions that balance the needs of varying markets and time horizons. Sequent provides customers with natural gas from the major producing regions and market hubs primarily in the eastern and mid continental United States. Sequent purchases transportation and storage capacity to meet its delivery requirements and customer obligations in the marketplace. Sequents customers benefit from its logistics expertise and ability to deliver natural gas at prices that are advantageous relative to other alternatives available to its customers. In 2006, Sequent entered into an agreement which should facilitate the expansion of its operations into the western United States and Canada and plans to pursue additional opportunities in these regions during 2007. Sequent continues to work on projects and transactions to extend its operating territory and is entering into agreements of longer duration, as well as evaluating opportunities to expand its business focus and models. Seasonality Fixed cost commitments are generally incurred evenly over the year, while margins generated through the use of the assets are generally greatest in the winter heating season and occasionally in the summer due to peak usage by power generators in meeting air conditioning load. This increases the seasonality of Sequents business, generally resulting in higher margins in the first and fourth quarters. Competition Sequent competes for asset management business with other energy wholesalers, often through a competitive bidding process. There has been significant consolidation of energy wholesale operations, particularly among major gas producers. Financial institutions have also entered the marketplace. As a result, energy wholesalers have become increasingly willing to place bids for asset management transactions that are priced to capture market share. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, which could result in downward pressure on the volume of transactions and the related margins available in this portion of Sequents business. 33 Table of Contents Asset Management Transactions Our asset management customers include our own utilities, nonaffiliated utilities, municipal utilities and large industrial customers. These customers must independently contract for transportation and storage capacity to meet their demands, and they typically contract for this capacity on a 365 day basis even though they may only need a portion of the capacity to meet their peak demands. Sequent enters into agreements with these customers, either through contract assignment or agency arrangement, whereby Sequent uses the customers rights to transportation and storage capacity during periods when customers do not need it. Sequent captures margin by optimizing the purchase, transportation, storage and sale of natural gas, and Sequent typically either shares profits with customers or pays them a fee for using their assets. The following table provides additional information on Sequents asset management agreements with its affiliated utilities. Type of fee % Shared or Profit sharing / fees payments In millions Expiration date Timing of payment structure annual fee 2006 2005 2004 Elkton Gas Mar 2008 Monthly Fixed fee (A ) $ $ $ Chattanooga Gas Mar 2008 Annually Profit sharing 50 % 4 2 1 Atlanta Gas Light Mar 2008 Semi Annually Profit sharing 60 % 6 4 4 Elizabethtown Gas Mar 2008 Monthly Fixed fee $ 4 4 Florida City Gas Mar 2008 Annually Profit sharing 50 % Virginia Natural Gas Mar 2009 Annually Profit sharing (B ) 2 5 3 Total $ 16 $ 11 $ 8 (A) Annual fixed fee is less than $1 million. (B) Profit sharing is based on a tiered sharing structure. In January 2006, the Georgia Commission extended the asset management agreement between Sequent and Atlanta Gas Light for two additional years. In addition, Sequents asset management agreements with Chattanooga Gas and Elkton Gas were extended for an additional year through March 2008. Transportation Transactions Sequent contracts for natural gas transportation capacity and participates in transactions that manage the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to result in the lowest cost to serve its various markets. Sequent seeks to optimize this process on a daily basis as market conditions change by evaluating all the natural gas supplies, transportation alternatives and markets to which it has access and identifying the least cost alternatives to serve the various markets. This enables Sequent to capture geographic pricing differences across these various markets as delivered gas prices change. As Sequent executes transactions to secure transportation capacity, it often enters into forward financial contracts to hedge its positions. The hedging instruments are derivatives, and Sequent reflects changes in the derivatives fair value in its reported operating results. During 2006, Sequent reported gains of $12 million associated with transportation capacity hedges. The majority of this amount will be reversed during 2007 as the positions are settled. Sequent did not report any significant gains or losses on these types of hedges during 2005 or 2004. Producer Services Sequents producer services business primarily focuses on aggregating natural gas supply from various small and medium sized producers located throughout the natural gas production areas of the United States, principally in the Gulf Coast region. Sequent provides producers with certain logistical and risk management services that offer producers attractive options to move their supply into the pipeline grid. Aggregating volumes of natural gas from these producers allows Sequent to provide markets to producers who seek a reliable outlet for their natural gas production. Peaking Services Sequent generates operating margin through, among other things, the sale of peaking services, which includes receiving a fee from affiliated and nonaffiliated customers that guarantees those customers will receive gas under peak conditions. Sequent incurs costs to support its obligations under these agreements, which are reduced in whole or in part as the matching obligations expire. Sequent will continue to seek new peaking transactions as well as work toward extending those that are set to expire. 34 Table of Contents Credit Rating Sequent has certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Sequent would need to post collateral to continue transacting with some of its counterparties. Posting collateral would have a negative effect on our liquidity. If such collateral were not posted, Sequents ability to continue transacting with these counterparties would be impaired. If at December 31, 2006 our credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade, the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between Sequent and its counterparties would have totaled $10 million. Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities We account for derivative transactions in connection with Sequents energy marketing activities on a fair value basis in accordance with SFAS 133. We record derivative energy commodity contracts (including both physical transactions and financial instruments) at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value reflected in our earnings in the period of change. Sequents energy trading contracts are recorded on an accrual basis as required under the EITF Issue No. 02 03, Issues Involved in Accounting for Contracts under EITF Issue No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities (EITF 02 03) rescission of EITF 98 10, unless they are derivatives that must be recorded at fair value under SFAS 133. As shown in the table below, Sequent recorded a net unrealized gain related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized in its energy marketing and risk management activities of $132 million during 2006, $30 million of unrealized losses during 2005 and unrealized gains of $22 million during 2004. The tables below illustrate the change in the net fair value of the derivative instruments and energy trading contracts during 2006, 2005 and 2004 and provide details of the net fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2006. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Net fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of period $ (13 ) $ 17 $ (5 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during period 17 (47 ) 11 Change in net fair value of contract gains 115 17 11 Net fair value of new contracts entered into during period Net fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period 119 (13 ) 17 Less net fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of period (13 ) 17 (5 ) Unrealized gain (loss) related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments $ 132 $ (30 ) $ 22 The sources of Sequents net fair value at December 31, 2006, are as follows. The prices actively quoted category represents Sequents positions in natural gas, which are valued exclusively using NYMEX futures prices. Prices provided by other external sources are basis transactions that represent the cost to transport the commodity from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. Sequents basis spreads are primarily based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers.

Sequent attempts to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with its storage portfolio. Sequent uses derivative instruments to reduce the risk associated with future changes in the price of natural gas. Sequent sells NYMEX futures contracts or other over the counter derivatives in forward months to substantially lock in the profit margin it will ultimately realize when the stored gas is actually sold. We view Sequents trading margins from two perspectives. First, our commercial decisions are based on economic value, which is defined as the locked in gain to be realized in the statement of income at the time the physical gas is withdrawn from storage and ultimately sold and the derivative instrument used to hedge natural gas price risk on that physical storage is settled. Second is the GAAP reported value both prior to and at the point of physical withdrawal. The GAAP amount is impacted by the process of accounting for the financial hedging instruments in interim periods at fair value between the time the gas is injected into storage and when it is ultimately withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled. The change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in earnings in the period of change and is characterized as unrealized gains or losses. 35 Table of Contents Natural gas stored in inventory is accounted for differently than the derivatives Sequent uses to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its storage portfolio. The natural gas that Sequent purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the lower of average cost or current market value. The derivatives that Sequent uses to mitigate commodity price risk are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period. This difference in accounting treatment can result in volatility in Sequents reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated. These accounting differences also affect the comparability of Sequents period over period results, since changes in forward NYMEX prices do not increase and decrease on a consistent basis from year to year. During most of 2006, Sequents reported results were positively impacted by decreases in forward NYMEX prices which resulted in the recognition of unrealized gains. In contrast, during most of 2005, Sequents reported results were negatively impacted by increases in forward NYMEX prices which resulted in the recognition of unrealized losses, although to a lesser extent. During 2004, the reported results were not as significantly affected by changes in forward NYMEX prices. As a result, unrealized gains during 2006 had a positive impact on the favorable variance between 2006 and 2005 and unrealized losses during 2005 had a negative impact on the favorable variance between 2005 and 2004. Storage Inventory Outlook The following graph presents the NYMEX forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2005, September 30, 2006, and December 31, 2006 for the period of January 2007 through March 2008, and reflects the prices at which Sequent could buy natural gas at the Henry Hub for delivery in the same time period. 36 Table of Contents Sequents expected withdrawals from physical salt dome and reservoir storage are presented in the table below along with the expected gross margin. Sequents expected gross margin is net of the impact of regulatory sharing and reflects the amounts that it would expect to realize in future periods based on the inventory withdrawal schedule and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2006. Sequents storage inventory is hedged with futures, and as shown below, the NYMEX short positions are equal to the physical long positions, which results in an overall locked in margin, timing notwithstanding. Sequents physical salt dome and reservoir volumes are presented in NYMEX equivalent contract units of 10,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu). Q1 2007 Q2 2007 Q3 2007 Q4 2007 Q1 2008 Total Salt dome 412 7 419 Reservoir 850 1 96 116 1,063 Total volumes 1,262 1 96 123 1,482 Expected gross margin (in millions) $ 9 $ $ $ 4 $ 5 $ 18 As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average cost of natural gas in inventory was $5.52 for physical salt dome storage and $5.18 for physical reservoir storage. These costs reflect adjustments that were recorded at the end of each quarter in 2006 in order to reduce the value of Sequents natural gas inventory to market value at certain locations. Sequent reduced the inventory value by $9 million after regulatory sharing for the quarter ended December 31 and by $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These adjustments negatively impacted Sequents reported earnings. However, as the carrying value of the inventory was reduced, the expected gross margin in the table above increased by an equal and offsetting amount. Sequent recovered $22 million of the aggregate $43 million of gross margin reductions during 2006 and expects to recover the majority of the remainder during the first quarter of 2007, as both the inventory is withdrawn from storage and sold and the hedging instruments in place to lock in the original margins on the storage transactions are settled and recorded in our earnings. Park and Loan Transactions Sequent routinely enters into park and loan transactions with various pipelines which allow it to park gas on or borrow gas from the pipeline in one period and reclaim gas from or repay gas to the pipeline in a subsequent period. The economics of these transactions are evaluated and price risks are managed in much the same way traditional reservoir and salt dome storage transactions are evaluated and managed. During the spring and summer months of 2006, natural gas prices were significantly lower than the futures prices for the upcoming winter months. As a result, Sequent has entered into transactions to park natural gas with the pipelines during the summer and receive the natural gas back during the winter. Sequent enters into forward NYMEX contracts to hedge its park and loan transactions. While the hedging instruments mitigate the price risk associated with the delivery and receipt of natural gas, they can also result in volatility in Sequents reported results during the period before the initial delivery or receipt of natural gas. During this period, if the forward NYMEX prices in the months of delivery and receipt do not change in equal amounts, Sequent will report a net unrealized gain or loss on the hedges. Although Sequents quarterly results were modestly impacted by unrealized hedge losses during 2006, on an annual basis Sequent did not report any significant gains or losses on park and loan hedges during 2006, 2005, or 2004. Results of Operations The following table presents results of operations for wholesale services for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Sequents operating margin increased by $47 million or 51% primarily due to improved commercial opportunities associated with larger seasonal storage spreads during the first half of 2006 and above average temperatures during the late summer months. These conditions offset the impacts of mild weather during the winter and early summer and the lower level of market volatility that we experienced compared to the hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. Additionally, the 2006 reported results were positively impacted by forward NYMEX prices moving downward and the narrowing of future seasonal spreads which resulted in the recognition of $41 million of gains on Sequents economic storage hedges in contrast to the prior period when forward prices increased and resulted in the recognition of $7 million of hedge losses. During 2006, Sequent also recognized $12 million in gains associated with financial instruments used to hedge its transportation capacity. There were no significant gains or losses associated with transportation hedges recognized in the prior period. The positive impact from the price movements in 2006 was partially offset by LOCOM adjustments that Sequent recorded at certain storage locations during the year in order to reduce the carrying value of its natural gas inventory to current market prices. In 2006, Sequent recorded a total of $43 million in LOCOM adjustments; however $22 million of the adjustments were recovered during the period as the affected inventory was withdrawn from storage and sold and the hedging instruments in place to lock in the original margins on the storage transactions were settled. In 2005, Sequent recorded LOCOM adjustments of $3 million. Operating expenses increased by $7 million or 17% primarily due to higher costs associated with an increase in the number of employees to support Sequents growth and additional incentive compensation costs directly related to stronger financial performance in 2006, as well as a higher percentage of corporate overhead costs than in 2005, primarily due to Sequents growth. The increased expenses were partially offset by lower costs associated with outside services and other expenses. 2005 compared to 2004 The increase in EBIT of $25 million or 104% in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in operating margin of $39 million partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $13 million. Sequents operating margin increased by $39 million or 74% primarily due to the significant effects of the Gulf Coast hurricanes during the third quarter of 2005 and lingering market disruptions and price volatility throughout the fourth quarter. For the first nine months of the year, reported operating margins were similar to that of the prior year, with quarterly decreases being offset by quarterly increases. However, during the third quarter of 2005, while Sequent created substantial economic value by serving its customers during the storms, the reported operating margin was negatively impacted by accounting losses associated with storage hedges as a result of increases in forward NYMEX prices of approximately $6 per MMBtu. During the fourth quarter, natural gas prices continued to be volatile in the aftermath of the hurricanes and Sequent was able to further optimize its storage and transportation positions at levels in excess of the prior year. In addition, previously reported hedge losses were partially recovered during the fourth quarter as NYMEX prices decreased approximately $3 per MMBtu. Operating expenses increased by $13 million or 45% due to additional payroll associated with increased headcount and increased employee incentive compensation costs driven by Sequents operational and financial growth and depreciation expense in connection with a new ETRM system, which was implemented during the fourth quarter of the prior year. 38 Table of Contents Energy Investments Jefferson Island This wholly owned subsidiary operates a salt dome storage and hub facility in Louisiana, approximately eight miles from the Henry Hub. The storage facility is regulated by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (Louisiana DNR) and by the FERC which has limited regulatory authority over the storage and transportation services. The facility consists of two salt dome gas storage caverns with approximately 9.72 Bcf of total capacity and about 7.23 Bcf of working gas capacity. The facility has approximately 0.72 Bcf/day withdrawal capacity and 0.36 Bcf/day injection capacity. Jefferson Island provides storage and hub services through its direct connection to the Henry Hub via the Sabine Pipeline and its interconnection with seven other pipelines in the area. Jefferson Islands entire portfolio is under firm subscription for the 2006 2007 winter period. In August 2006, the Office of Mineral Resources of the Louisiana DNR informed Jefferson Island that its mineral lease which authorizes salt extraction to create two new storage caverns at Lake Peigneur had been terminated. The Louisiana DNR identified two bases for the termination: (1) failure to make certain mining leasehold payments in a timely manner, and (2) the absence of salt mining operations for six months. In September 2006, Jefferson Island filed suit against the State of Louisiana to maintain its lease to complete an ongoing natural gas storage expansion project in Louisiana. The project would add two salt dome storage caverns under Lake Peigneur to the two caverns currently owned and operated by Jefferson Island. In its suit, Jefferson Island alleges that the Louisiana DNR accepted all leasehold payments without reservation and never provided Jefferson Island with notice and opportunity to cure, as required by state law. In its answer to the suit, the State denied that anyone with proper authority approved late payments. As to the second basis for termination, the suit contends that Jefferson Islands lease with the State of Louisiana was amended in 2004 so that mining operations are no longer required to maintain the lease. The States answer denies that the 2004 amendment was properly authorized. We continue to seek resolution of this dispute and we are optimistic that a settlement can be reached with the State of Louisiana that would allow us to proceed with the expansion. If we are unable to reach a settlement, we are not able to predict the outcome of the litigation. As of January 2007, our current estimate of costs incurred that would be considered unusable if the Louisiana DNR was successful in terminating our lease and causing us to cease the expansion project is approximately $8 million. Golden Triangle Storage In December 2006, we announced plans to build an approximate $180 million natural gas storage facility in the Beaumont, Texas area in the Spindletop salt dome. The project will consist of two underground salt dome storage caverns approximately a half mile to a mile below ground that will hold about 12 Bcf of working natural gas, or 17 Bcf total storage capacity. Golden Triangle Storage expects to finalize engineering plans and obtain regulatory permits to begin construction in 2008. The first salt dome cavern is expected to begin operations in 2010, and the second cavern is expected to begin operations in 2012. Pivotal Propane In 2005, this wholly owned subsidiary completed the construction of a propane air facility in the Virginia Natural Gas service area that provides up to 0.03 Bcf/day of propane air on a 10 day per year basis to serve Virginia Natural Gas peaking needs. AGL Networks This wholly owned subsidiary provides telecommunications conduit and dark fiber. AGL Networks leases and sells its fiber to a variety of customers in the Atlanta, Georgia and Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan areas, with a small presence in other cities in the United States. Its customers include local, regional and national telecommunications companies, internet service providers, educational institutions and other commercial entities. AGL Networks typically provides underground conduit and dark fiber to its customers under leasing arrangements with terms that vary from one to twenty years. In addition, AGL Networks offers telecommunications construction services to companies. AGL Networks competitors are any entities that have laid or will lay conduit and fiber on the same route as AGL Networks in the respective metropolitan areas. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents results of operations for energy investments for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Operating revenues $ 41 $ 56 $ 25 Cost of sales 5 16 12 Operating margin (1) 36 40 13 Operating expenses 26 23 8 Operating income 10 17 5 Other income 2 2 EBIT (1) $ 10 $ 19 $ 7 (1) These are non GAAP measurements. A reconciliation of operating margin and EBIT to our operating income and net income is contained in Results of Operations AGL Resources. 2006 compared to 2005 The $9 million or 47% decrease in EBIT is due primarily to the loss of operating margin and other income contributions from the 2005 sale of certain assets that we originally acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI and an increase in operating expenses due to higher business development expenses and increased costs at Jefferson Island offset by lower expenses related to the sale of the former NUI assets in 2005. Operating margin decreased $4 million or 10% largely due to the loss of $9 million of operating margin contributions from certain assets we acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI but sold in 2005. Jefferson Islands operating margin increased by $1 million compared to the prior year, in part due to increases in both firm and interruptible margin opportunities. AGL Networks operating margin increased by $1 million due to a larger customer base. Pivotal Propane contributed a $2 million increase primarily in the first quarter of 2006 as it did not become operational until April 2005. Operating expenses increased $3 million or 13% compared to 2005. Operating expenses at Pivotal Propane increased as it did not become operational until April 2005. Jefferson Islands operating expenses increased by $2 million due to the installation of new compression equipment and higher legal costs and property taxes. Additionally, project and corporate development costs increased $9 million. These costs were offset by decreased operating expenses of $8 million resulting from the 2005 sale of certain assets that we originally acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI. Other income decreased by $2 million due to the loss of earnings contributions from certain assets we acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI but sold in 2005. 2005 compared to 2004 The $12 million or 171% increase in EBIT in 2005 was primarily the result of increased operating margin of $27 million, offset by $15 million in higher operating expenses. Of the $27 million or 208% increase in operating margin, $13 million resulted from Jefferson Island, $8 million resulted from NUIs nonutility businesses and $3 million resulted from Pivotal Propane. AGL Networks contributed $4 million primarily as a result of recurring revenues from fiber leasing activities of $1 million and construction and new business activities of $3 million. Of the $15 million or 188% increase in operating expenses, $8 million resulted from NUIs nonutility businesses, $3 million resulted from Jefferson Island and $3 million resulted from Pivotal Propane. AGL Networks operating expenses were relatively flat in 2005 as compared to 2004. Corporate Our corporate segment includes our nonoperating business units, including AGL Services Company (AGSC) and AGL Capital Corporation (AGL Capital). AGL Capital provides for our ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program, the issuance of various debt and hybrid securities, and other financing arrangements. Pivotal Energy Development coordinates among our related operating segments, the development, construction or acquisition of assets in the southeastern, mid Atlantic and northeastern regions in order to extend our natural gas capabilities and improve system reliability while enhancing service to our customers in those areas. The focus of Pivotal Energy Developments commercial activities is to improve the economics of system reliability and natural gas deliverability in these targeted regions. We allocate substantially all of AGSCs operating expenses and interest costs to our operating segments in accordance with various regulations. Our corporate segment also includes intercompany eliminations for transactions between our operating business segments. Our EBIT results include the impact of these allocations to the various operating segments. The acquisition of additional assets, such as NUI and Jefferson Island, typically enables us to allocate corporate costs across a larger number of businesses and, as a result, lower the relative allocations charged to those business units we owned prior to the acquisition of the new businesses. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents results of operations for our corporate segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

As such, changes in EBIT amounts for the indicated periods reflect the relative changes in various general and administrative expenses, such as payroll, benefits and incentives, and outside services. Liquidity and Capital Resources To meet our capital and liquidity requirements we rely on operating cash flow; short term borrowings under our commercial paper program, which is backed by our Credit Facility; borrowings under Sequents and SouthStars lines of credit; and borrowings or stock issuances in the long term capital markets. Our issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and the SEC. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation. The availability of borrowings under our Credit Facility is limited and subject to a total debt to capital ratio financial covenant specified within the Credit Facility, which we currently meet. We will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies and other factors. Additionally, our liquidity and capital resource requirements may change in the future due to a number of other factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include: the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our resulting short term borrowing requirements, which typically peak during colder months increased gas supplies required to meet our customers needs during cold weather changes in wholesale prices and customer demand for our products and services regulatory changes and changes in ratemaking policies of regulatory commissions contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments interest rate changes pension and postretirement funding requirements changes in income tax laws margin requirements resulting from significant increases or decreases in our commodity prices operational risks the impact of natural disasters, including weather 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006.

(2) Charges recoverable through a PGA mechanism or alternatively billed to Marketers. Also includes demand charges associated with Sequent. (3) A subsidiary of NUI entered into two 20 year agreements for the firm transportation and storage of natural gas during 2003 with annual aggregate demand charges of approximately $5 million. As a result of our acquisition of NUI and in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we valued the contracts at fair value and established a long term liability that will be amortized over the remaining lives of the contracts. (4) Amount includes SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 1.4 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2006, and is valued at $89 million. (5) Includes $77 million of notes payable to Trusts redeemable in 2007. (6) Includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms. (7) We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. However, this accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. We calculate any required pension contributions using the projected unit credit cost method. Under this method, we were not required to make any pension contribution in 2006, but we voluntarily made a $5 million contribution in October 2006. See Note 4 Employee Benefit Plans, for additional pension information. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. The following table illustrates our expected contingent financial commitments as of December 31, 2006. Commitments due before Dec. 31, 2008 & In millions Total 2007 thereafter Standby letters of credit, performance/ surety bonds $ 14 $ 12 $ 2 Cash Flow from Operating Activities We prepare our statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation, changes in risk management assets and liabilities, undistributed earnings from equity investments, changes in deferred income taxes, gains or losses on the sale of assets and changes in the consolidated balance sheet for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. 42 Table of Contents Year over year changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our distribution operations, wholesale services and retail energy operations segments resulting from the impact of weather, the price of natural gas, the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries. We generate a large portion of our annual net income and subsequent increases in our accounts receivable in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to significant volumes of natural gas delivered by distribution operations and SouthStar to our customers during the peak heating season. In addition, our natural gas inventories, which usually peak on November 1, are largely drawn down in the heating season and provide a source of cash as this asset is used to satisfy winter sales demand. During this period, our accounts payable increases to reflect payments due to providers of the natural gas commodity and pipeline capacity. The value of the natural gas commodity can vary significantly from one period to the next as a result of volatility in the price of natural gas. Our natural gas costs and deferred purchased natural gas costs due from or to our customers represent the difference between natural gas costs that we have paid to suppliers in the past and amounts that we have collected from customers. These natural gas costs can cause significant variations in cash flows from period to period. In 2006, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $354 million, an increase of $274 million or 343% from the same period of 2005. The increase was primarily a result of higher earnings in 2006 of $19 million, the recovery of working capital during 2006 that was deployed in 2005 due to the significantly higher commodity prices and the amount of working capital required during the last quarter of 2004 when prices were significantly lower. Contributing to this increase was a decrease in the amount of natural gas purchased for inventory at Sequent and our utilities of $157 million as a result of mild weather in the prior heating season and therefore higher inventory balances for the current heating season. In 2005, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $80 million, a decrease of $207 million or 72% from the same period of 2004. The decrease was primarily a result of increased working capital requirements including increased spending of $183 million for seasonal inventory injections in advance of the winter sales demand. We spent more on these injections in 2005 primarily because of higher natural gas prices due to the effects of the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region and the full year impact associated with the purchase of natural gas for the utilities acquired in November 2004 from NUI, principally Elizabethtown Gas. These higher natural gas prices resulted in a 45% increase in the average cost of our natural gas inventories. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our investing activities consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) expenditures and our acquisitions of NUI for $116 million and Jefferson Island for $90 million in 2004. Additionally in 2006, we received approximately $5 million for the sale of land associated with former operating sites. In 2005, we sold our 50% interest in Saltville Gas Storage Company (Saltville) and associated subsidiaries for $66 million to a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation. We acquired Saltville through our acquisition of NUI. In 2004, we sold our general and limited partnership interests in US Propane LP, which was a joint venture formed in 2000, for $31 million. The following table provides additional information on our actual and estimated PP&E expenditures. In millions 2007 (1) 2006 2005 2004 Construction or preservation of distribution facilities $ 159 $ 144 $ 135 $ 64 Southern Natural Gas pipeline 32 PRP 35 31 48 95 Pivotal Propane plant 29 Jefferson Island 53 20 8 2 Telecommunications 3 3 1 5 Other (2) 28 55 43 69 Total $ 278 $ 253 $ 267 $ 264 (1) Estimated (2) Includes corporate information technology systems and infrastructure expenditures. The decrease of $14 million or 5% in PP&E expenditures for 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the $32 million acquisition of a 250 mile pipeline in Georgia from Southern Natural Gas (SNG) in 2005 and $7 million for construction of distribution facilities in Georgia. This was offset by higher expenditures of $8 million at the corporate segment primarily on information technology projects, $12 million at Jefferson Island on its expansion project and $5 million at retail energy operations primarily due to the implementation of a new ETRM system and enhancements to the retail billing system. 43 Table of Contents The increase of $3 million or 1% in PP&E expenditures for 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to the $32 million acquisition of the SNG pipeline in 2005 and increased expenditures of $71 million for the construction of distribution facilities, including $27 million at Elizabethtown Gas and Florida City Gas, both of which were acquired in November 2004. Also contributing to the increase was $6 million of additional expenditures at Jefferson Island which completed a capital project to improve its compression capabilities. These increases were offset by reduced PRP expenditures of $47 million due to the rate case settlement agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia Commission that extended the program to 2013, reduced expenditures of $29 million at the Pivotal Propane plant in Virginia as most of its construction expenditures were incurred in 2004 and reduced expenditures at Sequent as its energy trading risk management (ETRM) system was implemented in 2004. We expect our future PRP expenditures will primarily include larger diameter pipe than in prior years, the majority of which is located in more densely populated areas. The following table provides more information on our expected PRP expenditures. Year Miles of pipe to be replaced Expenditures (in millions) 2007 107 $ 35 2008 144 38 2009 147 44 2010 2013 337 120 Totals 735 $ 237 Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our financing activities are primarily composed of borrowings and payments of short term debt, payments of medium term notes, borrowings of senior notes, distributions to minority interests, cash dividends on our common stock issuances, and purchases and issuances of treasury shares. Our capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of equity and debt securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, appropriate mix of debt with fixed to floating interest rates (our variable debt target is 25% to 45% of total debt), as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities. As of December 31, 2006, our variable rate debt was $733 million or 34% of our total debt. This included $527 million of variable rate short term debt, $100 million of variable rate senior notes and $106 million of variable rate gas facility revenue bonds. In 2005, our variable rate debt was also 34% of our total debt. We also work to maintain or improve our credit ratings on our debt to effectively manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms. Factors we consider important in assessing our credit ratings include our balance sheet leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2006, which reflects no change from last year. S&P Moodys Fitch Corporate rating A Commercial paper A 2 P 2 F 2 Senior unsecured BBB+ Baa1 A Ratings outlook Negative Stable Stable Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the rating agencies downgrade our ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease. Our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. Our most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, and acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Our Credit Facilitys financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70%; however, our goal is to maintain this ratio at levels between 50% and 60%. We are currently in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. For more information on our debt, see Note 7 Debt. 44 Table of Contents We believe that accomplishing these capitalization objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and to allow us access to capital at reasonable costs. The components of our capital structure, as of the dates indicated, are summarized in the following tables. In millions Dec. 31, 2006 Short term debt $ 539 14 % Long term debt (1) 1,622 43 Total debt 2,161 57 Common shareholders equity 1,609 43 Total capitalization $ 3,770 100 % In millions Dec. 31, 2005 Short term debt $ 522 14 % Long term debt (1) 1,615 45 Total debt 2,137 59 Common shareholders equity 1,499 41 Total capitalization $ 3,636 100 % (1) Net of interest rate swaps. Short term Debt Our short term debt is composed of borrowings under our commercial paper program, lines of credit at Sequent, SouthStar and Pivotal Utility, the current portion of our medium term notes and the current portion of our capital leases. Our short term debt financing generally increases between June and December because our payments for natural gas and pipeline capacity are generally made to suppliers prior to the collection of accounts receivable from our customers. We typically reduce short term debt balances in the spring because a significant portion of our current assets are converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season. In August 2006, we replaced our previous Credit Facility with a new Credit Facility that supports our commercial paper program. Under the terms of the new Credit Facility, the aggregate principal amount available has been increased from $850 million to $1 billion and we can request an option to increase the aggregate principal amount available for borrowing to $1.25 billion on not more than three occasions during each calendar year. This Credit Facility expires August 31, 2011. The increased capacity under our Credit Facility increases our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program. Our total cash and available liquidity under our Credit Facility as of the dates indicated are shown in the table below. In millions Dec. 31, 2006 Dec. 31, 2005 Unused availability under the Credit Facility $ 1,000 $ 850 Cash and cash equivalents 20 32 Total cash and available liquidity under the Credit Facility $ 1,020 $ 882 As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. However, the availability of borrowings and unused availability under our Credit Facility is limited and subject to conditions specified within the Credit Facility, which we currently meet. These conditions include: the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70% the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the agreement In 2006, we extended Sequents two lines of credit through June 2007 and August 2007. In addition, we extended Pivotal Utilitys line of credit through August 2007. These unsecured lines of credit are unconditionally guaranteed by us. In November of 2006, SouthStar closed a five year $75 million credit facility. This facility will be used for working capital needs and general corporate needs. At December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit. Long term Debt In May 2006, we used the proceeds from the sale of commercial paper to redeem $150 million of junior subordinated debentures and to pay a $5 million note representing our investment in our Capital Trust, previously included in notes payable to trusts. In June 2006, we issued $175 million of 10 year senior notes at an interest rate of 6.375% and used the net proceeds of $173 million to repay the commercial paper. In January 2007, we used proceeds from the sale of commercial paper to redeem $11 million of 7% medium term notes previously scheduled to mature in January 2015. Interest Rate Swaps To maintain an effective capital structure, it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate and variable rate debt obligation. Minority Interest As a result of our consolidation of SouthStars accounts effective January 1, 2004, we recorded Piedmonts portion of SouthStars contributed capital as a minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets and included it as a component of our total capitalization. A cash distribution of $22 million in 2006, $19 million in 2005 and $14 million in 2004 for SouthStars dividend distributions to Piedmont were recorded in our consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. 45 Table of Contents Dividends on Common Stock In 2006, we made $111 million in common stock dividend payments. This was an increase of $11 million or 11% from 2005, which resulted from increases in the amount of our quarterly common stock dividends per share. In 2005, we made $100 million in common stock dividend payments. This was an increase of $25 million or 33% from 2004. The increase was due to our 11 million share common stock offering in November 2004, which increased the number of shares outstanding, and the increases in the amount of our quarterly common stock dividends per share. In the last three fiscal years, we have made the following increases in dividends on our common stock. For information about restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, see Note 6. Date of change % increase Quarterly dividend Indicated annual dividend Nov 2005 19 % $ 0.37 $ 1.48 Feb 2005 7 0.31 1.24 Apr 2004 4 0.29 1.16 Share Repurchases In March 2001 our Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 600,000 shares of our common stock to be used for issuances under the Officer Incentive Plan. During 2006, we purchased 32,801 shares. As of December 31, 2006, we had purchased a total 286,567 shares, leaving 313,433 shares available for purchase. In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to purchase up to eight million shares of our outstanding common stock over a five year period. These purchases are intended principally to offset share issuances under our employee and non employee director incentive compensation plans and our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases under this program may be made in the open market or in private transactions at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will purchase, and we can terminate or limit the program at any time. We will hold the purchased shares as treasury shares. During 2006, we repurchased 1,027,500 shares at a weighted average price of $36.67. For more information on our share repurchases see Item 5 Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Shelf Registration We currently have remaining capacity under an October 2004 shelf registration statement of approximately $782 million. We may seek additional financing through debt or equity offerings in the private or public markets at any time. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from our estimates. Each of the following critical accounting policies involves complex situations requiring a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. Pipeline Replacement Program Atlanta Gas Light was ordered by the Georgia Commission (through a joint stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Commission staff) to undertake a PRP that would replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system in the state of Georgia within a 10 year period beginning October 1, 1998. Atlanta Gas Light identified and, in accordance with this stipulation, provided notice to the Georgia Commission of 2,632 miles of bare steel and cast iron pipe to be replaced. On June 10, 2005, the Georgia Commission approved a Settlement Agreement with Atlanta Gas Light that, among other things, extends Atlanta Gas Lights PRP by five years to require that all replacements be completed by December 2013. The timing of replacements was subsequently specified in an amendment to the PRP stipulation. This amendment, which was approved by the Georgia Commission on December 20, 2005, requires Atlanta Gas Light to replace all cast iron pipe and 70% of all bare steel pipe by December 2010. The remaining 30% of bare steel pipe is required to be replaced by December 2013. Approximately 131 miles of cast iron and 604 miles of bare steel pipe still require replacement. If Atlanta Gas Light does not perform in accordance with the initial and amended PRP stipulation, it can be assessed certain nonperformance penalties. However, to date, Atlanta Gas Light is in full compliance. 46 Table of Contents The stipulation also provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred under the program, which Atlanta Gas Light has recorded as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset has two components: the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders The determination of future expected costs involves judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the future expected costs are projected capital expenditure spending, including labor and material costs, and the remaining infrastructure footage to be replaced for the remaining years of the program. Atlanta Gas Light recorded a long term liability of $202 million as of December 31, 2006 and $235 million as of December 31, 2005, which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the PRP. As of December 31, 2006, Atlanta Gas Light had recorded a current liability of $35 million, representing expected PRP expenditures for the next 12 months. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. If the recorded liability for PRP had been higher or lower by $10 million, Atlanta Gas Lights expected recovery would have changed by approximately $1 million. Environmental Remediation Liabilities Atlanta Gas Light historically reported estimates of future remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. As we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter cleanup contracts, Atlanta Gas Light is increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of its remediation program. These estimates contain various engineering uncertainties, and Atlanta Gas Light continuously attempts to refine and update these engineering estimates. Our latest available estimate as of December 31, 2006 for those elements of the remediation program with in place contracts or engineering cost estimates is $13 million for Atlanta Gas Lights Georgia and Florida sites. This is an increase of $1 million from the December 31, 2005 estimate of projected engineering and in place contracts, resulting from increased cost estimates during 2006. For elements of the remediation program where Atlanta Gas Light still cannot perform engineering cost estimates, considerable variability remains in available estimates. The estimated remaining cost of future actions at these sites is $14 million. Atlanta Gas Light estimates certain other costs it pays related to administering the remediation program and remediation of sites currently in the investigation phase. Beyond 2008, these costs cannot be estimated. Atlanta Gas Lights environmental remediation liability is included in its corresponding regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2006, the regulatory asset was $104 million, which is a combination of the accrued remediation liability and unrecovered cash expenditures. Atlanta Gas Lights estimate does not include other potential expenses, such as unasserted property damage, personal injury or natural resource damage claims, unbudgeted legal expenses, or other costs for which it may be held liable but with respect to which the amount cannot be reasonably forecast. Atlanta Gas Lights recovery of environmental remediation costs is subject to review by the Georgia Commission which may seek to disallow the recovery of some expenses. In New Jersey, Elizabethtown Gas is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Although the actual total cost of future environmental investigation and remediation efforts cannot be estimated with precision, the range of reasonably probable costs is $60 million to $118 million. As of December 31, 2006, we have recorded a liability of $60 million. The New Jersey Commission has authorized Elizabethtown Gas to recover prudently incurred remediation costs for the New Jersey properties through its remediation adjustment clause. As a result, Elizabethtown Gas has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $66 million, inclusive of interest, as of December 31, 2006, reflecting the future recovery of both incurred costs and future remediation liabilities in the state of New Jersey. Elizabethtown Gas has also been successful in recovering a portion of remediation costs incurred in New Jersey from its insurance carriers and continues to pursue additional recovery. As of December 31, 2006, the variation between the amounts of the environmental remediation cost liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and the associated regulatory asset is due to expenditures for environmental investigation and remediation exceeding recoveries from ratepayers and insurance carriers. We also own several former NUI remediation sites located outside of New Jersey. One site, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, is subject to an order by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Preliminary estimates for investigation and remediation costs range from $10 million to $17 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had recorded a liability of $10 million related to this site. There is another site in North Carolina where investigation and remediation is probable, although no regulatory order exists and we do not believe costs associated with this site can be reasonably estimated. In addition, there are as many as six other sites with which NUI had some association, although no basis for liability has been asserted. We do not believe that costs to investigate and remediate these sites, if any, can be reasonably estimated at this time. With respect to these costs, we currently pursue or intend to pursue recovery from ratepayers, former owners and operators and insurance carriers. Although we have been successful in recovering a portion of these remediation costs from our insurance carriers, we are not able to express a belief as to the success of additional recovery efforts. We are working with the regulatory agencies to prudently manage our remediation costs so as to mitigate the impact of such costs on both ratepayers and shareholders. 47 Table of Contents Derivatives and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as updated by SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 149), established accounting and reporting standards which require that every derivative financial instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for and is designated as a normal purchase and sale, it is exempted from the fair value accounting treatment of SFAS 133, as updated by SFAS 149, and is accounted for using traditional accrual accounting. SFAS 133 requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, SFAS 133 allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI until maturity in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, SFAS 133 requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. SFAS 133 applies to Treasury Locks and interest rate swaps executed by AGL Capital and gas commodity contracts executed by both Sequent and SouthStar. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 1, Accounting Policies and Methods of Application, Note 2 Risk Management and Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Commodity related Derivative Instruments We are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. Through Sequent and SouthStar, we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas. Sequent recognizes the change in value of derivative instruments as an unrealized gain or loss in revenues in the period when the market value of the instrument changes. Sequent recognizes cash inflows and outflows associated with the settlement of its risk management activities in operating cash flows, and reports these settlements as receivables and payables in the balance sheet separately from the risk management activities reported as energy marketing receivables and trade payables. We attempt to mitigate substantially all our commodity price risk associated with Sequents natural gas storage portfolio and lock in the economic margin at the time we enter into purchase transactions for our stored natural gas. We purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price we pay plus storage costs is less than the market price we could receive in the future. We lock in the economic margin by selling NYMEX futures contracts or other over the counter derivatives in the forward months corresponding with our withdrawal periods. We use contracts to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially lock in the profit margin we will ultimately realize when the stored natural gas is actually sold. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS 133. The purchase, storage and sale of natural gas are accounted for differently from the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported net income, even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated. We do not currently use hedge accounting under SFAS 133 to account for this activity. Natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the lower of average cost or market. Under current accounting guidance, we would recognize a loss in any period when the market price for natural gas is lower than the carrying amount of our purchased natural gas inventory. Costs to store the natural gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred. We recognize revenues and cost of natural gas sold in our statement of consolidated income in the period we sell gas and it is delivered out of the storage facility. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the margin upon the sale of stored natural gas are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change. This difference in accounting, the lower of average cost or market basis for our storage inventory versus the fair value accounting for the derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk, can and does result in volatility in our reported earnings. 48 Table of Contents Over time, gains or losses on the sale of storage inventory will be substantially offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in realization of the economic profit margin we expected when we entered into the transactions. This accounting difference causes Sequents earnings on its storage positions to be affected by natural gas price changes, even though the economic profits remain essentially unchanged. See Results of Operations Wholesale Services for a discussion of the potential volatility in earnings due to changes in natural gas prices. SouthStar also uses derivative instruments to manage exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStars objective for holding these derivatives is to minimize volatility in wholesale commodity natural gas prices. A portion of SouthStars derivative transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. Derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings in the same period the underlying hedged item is reflected in the income statement. As of December 31, 2006, the ending balance in OCI for derivative transactions designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133 was a gain of $6 million, net of minority interest and taxes. Any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset the losses or gains on the hedged item, is recorded into earnings in the period in which it occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. SouthStars remaining derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. Therefore, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the period of change. SouthStar also enters into weather derivative instruments in order to preserve margins in the event of warmer than normal weather in the winter months. These contracts are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 02, Accounting for Weather Derivatives. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings in the period of change. The weather derivative contracts contain strike amount provisions based on cumulative heating degree days for the covered periods. In September 2006, SouthStar entered into weather derivatives (swaps and options) for the 2006 2007 winter heating season, primarily from November through March. As of December 31, 2006, SouthStar recorded a receivable of $7 million for this hedging activity. Contingencies Our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities, including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, rate matters, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates can be, and often are, revised either negatively or positively, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. We annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is used principally to calculate the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on Moodys Corporate AA long term bond rate of 5.8% and the Citigroup Pension Liability rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2006. We further use these market indices as a comparison to a single equivalent discount rate derived with the assistance of our actuarial advisors. This analysis as of December 31, 2006 produced a single equivalent discount rate of 5.8%. 49 Table of Contents The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods. The expected long term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that years annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs. Prior to 2006, we estimated the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based on our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. However, starting in 2006, our postretirement plans have been capped at 2.5% for increases in health care costs. Consequently, a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate does not materially affect the periodic benefit cost for our postretirement plans. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase our accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4 million. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease our accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4 million. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon an annual review of participant census information as of the measurement date. At December 31, 2006, our pension and postretirement liability decreased by approximately $18 million, resulting in an after tax gain to OCI of $11 million. This adjustment reflected our funding contributions to the plan and updated valuations for the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and plan assets. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), as the primary factors that drive the value of our unfunded ABO are the assumed discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. Additionally, equity market performance has a significant effect on our market related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five year moving weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense. The actual return on our pension plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets will have an impact on our ABO as of December 31, 2006 and our pension expense for 2007. We are unable to determine how this actual return on plan assets will affect future ABO and pension expense, as actuarial assumptions and differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are determined at the time we complete our actuarial evaluation as of December 31, 2006. Our actual returns may also be positively or negatively impacted as a result of future performance in the equity and bond markets. The following tables illustrate the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, as discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: 50 Table of Contents AGL Resources Inc. Retirement and Postretirement Plans In millions Pension Benefits Health and Life Benefits Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Increase (decrease) in cost Increase (decrease) in obligation Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1% $ / $(3) / 3 Discount rate +/ 1% (40) / 45 (4) / 4 Healthcare cost trend rate +/ 1% $4 / (4) $ / NUI Corporation Retirement Plan In millions Pension Benefits Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1% $ / $(1) / 1 Discount rate +/ 1% (8) / 8 / At December 31, 2006, NUIs PBO was $86 million, reflecting $12 million in adjustments for terminations and settlement of liabilities affected by the NUI purchase transaction, offset by net periodic benefit cost of $3 million in 2006. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the MRVPA. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. In addition to the assumptions listed above, the measurement of the plans obligations and costs depend on other factors such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans, earnings on the plans assets and mortality rates. Income Taxes Our net long term deferred tax liability totaled $544 million at December 31, 2006 (see Note 10 Income Taxes). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our income tax returns. For state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had a $3 million valuation allowance on $47 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. In addition, we maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure. We believe this liability for potential exposure to be adequate. 51 Table of Contents Accounting Developments For information regarding accounting developments, see Note 1, Accounting Policies and Methods of Application. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and credit. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. Interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations and in wholesale services. Our Risk Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with, and adherence to, the terms within these policies, including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels. Our RMC consists of members of senior management who monitor open commodity price risk positions and other types of risk, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities. It is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the RMC to perform its monitoring functions. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatments are described in further detail in Note 2, Risk Management. Commodity Price Risk Retail Energy Operations SouthStars use of derivatives is governed by a risk management policy, approved and monitored by its Risk and Asset Management Committee, which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. A 95% confidence interval is used to evaluate VaR exposure. A 95% confidence interval means there is a 5% probability that the actual change in portfolio value will be greater than the calculated VaR value over the holding period. We calculate VaR based on the variance covariance technique. This technique requires several assumptions for the basis of the calculation, such as price volatility, confidence interval and holding period. Our VaR may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because, although VaR is a common metric in the energy industry, there is no established industry standard for calculating VaR or for the assumptions underlying such calculations. The following table provides more information on SouthStars 1 day holding period VaR. In millions 1 day 2006 period end $ 0.1 2005 period end 0.3 SouthStar generates operating margin from the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions and derivative instruments aimed at managing exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStar uses these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins as wholesale prices fluctuate and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins. Wholesale Services Sequent routinely utilizes various types of financial and other instruments to mitigate certain commodity price risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and over the counter energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and financial swap agreements. The following table includes the fair values and average values of Sequents energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Sequent bases the average values on monthly averages for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Average values at December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Asset $ 95 $ 83 Liability 43 102 Fair value at December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Asset $ 133 $ 97 Liability 14 110 Sequent employs a systematic approach to evaluating and managing the risks associated with contracts related to wholesale marketing and risk management, including VaR. Similar to SouthStar, Sequent uses a 1 day holding period and a 95% confidence interval to evaluate its VaR exposure. Sequents open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management, including the chief risk officer. Because Sequent generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures and over the counter markets, its open exposure is generally minimal, permitting Sequent to operate within relatively low VaR limits. Sequent employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risks of its open positions. 52 Table of Contents Sequents management actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR. Sequent continues to maintain a relatively matched book, where its total buy volume is close to its sell volume, with minimal open commodity risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a 1 day holding period for all positions, Sequents portfolio of positions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 had the following 1 day holding period VaRs. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Period end $ 1.3 $ 0.6 $ 0.1 12 month average 1.2 0.4 0.1 High 2.5 1.1 0.4 Low (1) 0.7 0.0 0.0 (1) $0.0 values represent amounts less than $0.1 million. During most of 2005 and 2006, Sequent experienced increases in its high, average and period end 1 day VaR amounts compared to prior periods. These increases were directly associated with higher prices and related price volatility created by the Gulf Coast hurricanes during the third quarter of 2005 and the hurricanes lingering effects through the fourth quarters of 2005 and into 2006. In addition, Sequent has entered into additional storage and transportation positions, some of which are longer dated and are not fully hedged due to a lack of liquidity in certain markets for the future periods. As a result, these positions have increased Sequents reported VaR amounts. Sequent has refined the methodology associated with its VaR calculation to incorporate dynamic volatility factors and to exclude interruptible transportation positions. These changes had somewhat offsetting effects as the dynamic volatility factors increased the VaR and the exclusion of interruptible transportation positions reduced the VaR. This new methodology was applied on a prospective basis beginning in the second quarter of 2006. While not considered material, Sequents VaR amounts increased compared to prior periods as its calculation is now more sensitive to market volatility and the relative level of risk associated with increased storage and transportation positions. Due to the dynamic nature of measuring VaR, Sequent will continually evaluate the components of its VaR calculation and will make refinements as deemed necessary. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows. Our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. To facilitate the achievement of desired fixed rate to variable rate debt ratios, AGL Capital entered into interest rate swaps whereby it agreed to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable amounts calculated by reference to agreed on notional principal amounts. These swaps are designated to hedge the fair values of $100 million of the $300 million Senior Notes due in 2011. Credit Risk Distribution Operations Atlanta Gas Light has a concentration of credit risk as it bills only 11 Marketers in Georgia for its services. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies with the time of the year, with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in Georgia. These retail functions include customer service, billing, collections, and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Lights tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketers highest months estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2006, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, one of which was SouthStar, accounted for approximately 36% of our consolidated operating margin and 47% of distribution operations operating margin. Several factors are designed to mitigate our risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. We accept credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities. The RMC reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each Marketer. We believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify, manage and report on Atlanta Gas Lights credit risk exposure to Marketers. Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments to Marketers of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. The fact that some of the interstate pipelines require Marketers to maintain security for their obligations to the interstate pipelines arising out of the assigned capacity somewhat mitigates this risk. 53 Table of Contents Retail Energy Operations SouthStar obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed SouthStars credit threshold. The average credit score of SouthStars Georgia customers has increased 3% since 2004. SouthStar considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on a review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, SouthStar also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties Moodys, S&P and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements. Wholesale Services Sequent has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Sequent also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Sequent is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Sequents credit risk. Sequent also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Master netting agreements enable Sequent to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Sequent also nets across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. Additionally, Sequent may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Sequent conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for its counterpartys line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have a minimum long term debt rating of Baa3 from Moodys and BBB from S&P. Generally, Sequent requires credit enhancements by way of guaranty, cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not meet the minimum ratings threshold. Sequent, which provides services to Marketers and utility and industrial customers, also has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30 day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. As of December 31, 2006, Sequents top 20 counterparties represented approximately 57% of the total counterparty exposure of $394 million, derived by adding together the top 20 counterparties exposures and dividing by the total of Sequents counterparties exposures. 54 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, Sequents counterparties, or the counterparties guarantors, had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A , which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moodys ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moodys and 1 being D or Default by S&P and Moodys. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterpartys assigned internal rating is multiplied by the counterpartys credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. That sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to an S&P equivalent. The following tables show Sequents commodity receivable and payable positions as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Sequent would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. Posting collateral would have a negative effect on our liquidity. If such collateral were not posted, Sequents ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired. If at December 31, 2006 Sequents credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade status, the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between Sequent and its counterparties would have totaled $10 million. 55 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Commodity related Derivative Instruments We are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. Through Sequent and SouthStar, we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas. Sequent recognizes the change in value of derivative instruments as an unrealized gain or loss in revenues in the period when the market value of the instrument changes. Sequent recognizes cash inflows and outflows associated with the settlement of its risk management activities in operating cash flows, and reports these settlements as receivables and payables in the balance sheet separately from the risk management activities reported as energy marketing receivables and trade payables. We attempt to mitigate substantially all our commodity price risk associated with Sequents natural gas storage portfolio and lock in the economic margin at the time we enter into purchase transactions for our stored natural gas. We purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price we pay plus storage costs is less than the market price we could receive in the future. We lock in the economic margin by selling NYMEX futures contracts or other over the counter derivatives in the forward months corresponding with our withdrawal periods. We use contracts to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially lock in the profit margin we will ultimately realize when the stored natural gas is actually sold. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS 133. The purchase, storage and sale of natural gas are accounted for differently from the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported net income, even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated. We do not currently use hedge accounting under SFAS 133 to account for this activity. Natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the lower of average cost or market. Under current accounting guidance, we would recognize a loss in any period when the market price for natural gas is lower than the carrying amount of our purchased natural gas inventory. Costs to store the natural gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred. We recognize revenues and cost of natural gas sold in our statement of consolidated income in the period we sell gas and it is delivered out of the storage facility. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the margin upon the sale of stored natural gas are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change. This difference in accounting, the lower of average cost or market basis for our storage inventory versus the fair value accounting for the derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk, can and does result in volatility in our reported earnings. 48 Table of Contents Over time, gains or losses on the sale of storage inventory will be substantially offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in realization of the economic profit margin we expected when we entered into the transactions. This accounting difference causes Sequents earnings on its storage positions to be affected by natural gas price changes, even though the economic profits remain essentially unchanged. See Results of Operations Wholesale Services for a discussion of the potential volatility in earnings due to changes in natural gas prices. SouthStar also uses derivative instruments to manage exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStars objective for holding these derivatives is to minimize volatility in wholesale commodity natural gas prices. A portion of SouthStars derivative transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. Derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings in the same period the underlying hedged item is reflected in the income statement. As of December 31, 2006, the ending balance in OCI for derivative transactions designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133 was a gain of $6 million, net of minority interest and taxes. Any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset the losses or gains on the hedged item, is recorded into earnings in the period in which it occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. SouthStars remaining derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. Therefore, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the period of change. SouthStar also enters into weather derivative instruments in order to preserve margins in the event of warmer than normal weather in the winter months. These contracts are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 02, Accounting for Weather Derivatives. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings in the period of change. The weather derivative contracts contain strike amount provisions based on cumulative heating degree days for the covered periods. In September 2006, SouthStar entered into weather derivatives (swaps and options) for the 2006 2007 winter heating season, primarily from November through March. As of December 31, 2006, SouthStar recorded a receivable of $7 million for this hedging activity. Contingencies Our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities, including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, rate matters, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates can be, and often are, revised either negatively or positively, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. We annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is used principally to calculate the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on Moodys Corporate AA long term bond rate of 5.8% and the Citigroup Pension Liability rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2006. We further use these market indices as a comparison to a single equivalent discount rate derived with the assistance of our actuarial advisors. This analysis as of December 31, 2006 produced a single equivalent discount rate of 5.8%. 49 Table of Contents The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods. The expected long term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that years annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs. Prior to 2006, we estimated the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based on our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. However, starting in 2006, our postretirement plans have been capped at 2.5% for increases in health care costs. Consequently, a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate does not materially affect the periodic benefit cost for our postretirement plans. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase our accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4 million. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease our accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4 million. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon an annual review of participant census information as of the measurement date. At December 31, 2006, our pension and postretirement liability decreased by approximately $18 million, resulting in an after tax gain to OCI of $11 million. This adjustment reflected our funding contributions to the plan and updated valuations for the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and plan assets. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), as the primary factors that drive the value of our unfunded ABO are the assumed discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. Additionally, equity market performance has a significant effect on our market related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five year moving weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense. The actual return on our pension plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets will have an impact on our ABO as of December 31, 2006 and our pension expense for 2007. We are unable to determine how this actual return on plan assets will affect future ABO and pension expense, as actuarial assumptions and differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are determined at the time we complete our actuarial evaluation as of December 31, 2006. Our actual returns may also be positively or negatively impacted as a result of future performance in the equity and bond markets. The following tables illustrate the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, as discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: 50 Table of Contents AGL Resources Inc. Retirement and Postretirement Plans In millions Pension Benefits Health and Life Benefits Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Increase (decrease) in cost Increase (decrease) in obligation Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1% $ / $(3) / 3 Discount rate +/ 1% (40) / 45 (4) / 4 Healthcare cost trend rate +/ 1% $4 / (4) $ / NUI Corporation Retirement Plan In millions Pension Benefits Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1% $ / $(1) / 1 Discount rate +/ 1% (8) / 8 / At December 31, 2006, NUIs PBO was $86 million, reflecting $12 million in adjustments for terminations and settlement of liabilities affected by the NUI purchase transaction, offset by net periodic benefit cost of $3 million in 2006. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the MRVPA. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. In addition to the assumptions listed above, the measurement of the plans obligations and costs depend on other factors such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans, earnings on the plans assets and mortality rates. Income Taxes Our net long term deferred tax liability totaled $544 million at December 31, 2006 (see Note 10 Income Taxes). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our income tax returns. For state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had a $3 million valuation allowance on $47 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. In addition, we maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure. We believe this liability for potential exposure to be adequate. 51 Table of Contents Accounting Developments For information regarding accounting developments, see Note 1, Accounting Policies and Methods of Application. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and credit. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. Interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations and in wholesale services. Our Risk Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with, and adherence to, the terms within these policies, including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels. Our RMC consists of members of senior management who monitor open commodity price risk positions and other types of risk, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities. It is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the RMC to perform its monitoring functions. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatments are described in further detail in Note 2, Risk Management. Commodity Price Risk Retail Energy Operations SouthStars use of derivatives is governed by a risk management policy, approved and monitored by its Risk and Asset Management Committee, which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. A 95% confidence interval is used to evaluate VaR exposure. A 95% confidence interval means there is a 5% probability that the actual change in portfolio value will be greater than the calculated VaR value over the holding period. We calculate VaR based on the variance covariance technique. This technique requires several assumptions for the basis of the calculation, such as price volatility, confidence interval and holding period. Our VaR may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because, although VaR is a common metric in the energy industry, there is no established industry standard for calculating VaR or for the assumptions underlying such calculations. The following table provides more information on SouthStars 1 day holding period VaR. In millions 1 day 2006 period end $ 0.1 2005 period end 0.3 SouthStar generates operating margin from the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions and derivative instruments aimed at managing exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStar uses these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins as wholesale prices fluctuate and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins. Wholesale Services Sequent routinely utilizes various types of financial and other instruments to mitigate certain commodity price risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and over the counter energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and financial swap agreements. The following table includes the fair values and average values of Sequents energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Sequent bases the average values on monthly averages for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Average values at December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Asset $ 95 $ 83 Liability 43 102 Fair value at December 31, In millions 2006 2005 Asset $ 133 $ 97 Liability 14 110 Sequent employs a systematic approach to evaluating and managing the risks associated with contracts related to wholesale marketing and risk management, including VaR. Similar to SouthStar, Sequent uses a 1 day holding period and a 95% confidence interval to evaluate its VaR exposure. Sequents open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management, including the chief risk officer. Because Sequent generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures and over the counter markets, its open exposure is generally minimal, permitting Sequent to operate within relatively low VaR limits. Sequent employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risks of its open positions. 52 Table of Contents Sequents management actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR. Sequent continues to maintain a relatively matched book, where its total buy volume is close to its sell volume, with minimal open commodity risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a 1 day holding period for all positions, Sequents portfolio of positions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 had the following 1 day holding period VaRs. In millions 2006 2005 2004 Period end $ 1.3 $ 0.6 $ 0.1 12 month average 1.2 0.4 0.1 High 2.5 1.1 0.4 Low (1) 0.7 0.0 0.0 (1) $0.0 values represent amounts less than $0.1 million. During most of 2005 and 2006, Sequent experienced increases in its high, average and period end 1 day VaR amounts compared to prior periods. These increases were directly associated with higher prices and related price volatility created by the Gulf Coast hurricanes during the third quarter of 2005 and the hurricanes lingering effects through the fourth quarters of 2005 and into 2006. In addition, Sequent has entered into additional storage and transportation positions, some of which are longer dated and are not fully hedged due to a lack of liquidity in certain markets for the future periods. As a result, these positions have increased Sequents reported VaR amounts. Sequent has refined the methodology associated with its VaR calculation to incorporate dynamic volatility factors and to exclude interruptible transportation positions. These changes had somewhat offsetting effects as the dynamic volatility factors increased the VaR and the exclusion of interruptible transportation positions reduced the VaR. This new methodology was applied on a prospective basis beginning in the second quarter of 2006. While not considered material, Sequents VaR amounts increased compared to prior periods as its calculation is now more sensitive to market volatility and the relative level of risk associated with increased storage and transportation positions. Due to the dynamic nature of measuring VaR, Sequent will continually evaluate the components of its VaR calculation and will make refinements as deemed necessary. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows. Our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. To facilitate the achievement of desired fixed rate to variable rate debt ratios, AGL Capital entered into interest rate swaps whereby it agreed to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable amounts calculated by reference to agreed on notional principal amounts. These swaps are designated to hedge the fair values of $100 million of the $300 million Senior Notes due in 2011.

In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. We accept credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities. The RMC reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each Marketer. We believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify, manage and report on Atlanta Gas Lights credit risk exposure to Marketers. Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments to Marketers of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. The fact that some of the interstate pipelines require Marketers to maintain security for their obligations to the interstate pipelines arising out of the assigned capacity somewhat mitigates this risk. 53 Table of Contents Retail Energy Operations SouthStar obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed SouthStars credit threshold.
