ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are an energy services holding company whose principal business is the distribution of natural gas in six states Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, Tennessee and Virginia. Our six utilities serve more than 2.2 million end use customers, making us the largest distributor of natural gas in the southeastern and mid Atlantic regions of the United States based on customer count. We are involved in various related businesses, including retail natural gas marketing to end use customers primarily in Georgia; natural gas asset management and related logistics activities for our own utilities as well as for nonaffiliated companies; natural gas storage arbitrage and related activities; and the development and operation of high deliverability underground natural gas storage assets. We also own and operate a small telecommunications business that constructs and operates conduit and fiber infrastructure within select metropolitan areas. We manage these businesses through four operating segments distribution operations, retail energy operations, wholesale services and energy investments and a nonoperating corporate segment. As of January 31, 2008, we employed a total of 2,332 employees across these five segments. The distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the six states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders. With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Various mechanisms exist that limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in all of our jurisdictions. Our retail energy operations segment, which consists of SouthStar, also is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to mitigate potential weather impacts. Our Sequent subsidiary within our wholesale services segment is relatively temperature sensitive, but has greater opportunity to capture margin as price volatility increases. Our energy investments segments primary activity is our natural gas storage business, which develops, acquires and operates high deliverability salt dome storage assets in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. While this business also can generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, the majority of our storage services are covered under medium to long term contracts at a fixed market rate. Executive Summary In support of our goals for 2007, we focused our efforts around five key operating priorities as discussed below. Marketing and customer retention investments in distribution operations and retail energy operations We targeted overall net customer growth rates for our distribution operations business in the range of 1% to 1.5%. In each of our utility service areas, we implemented targeted marketing and growth programs aimed at emphasizing natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and expanding the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In 2007, we grew our average customer count by approximately 21,000, a 0.9% increase as compared to last year. While this increase is slightly below our targeted range, the increase in the growth rate is an improvement over our relatively flat customer growth in 2006. Last year we had slower customer growth coming out of the winter heating season due in part to much higher natural gas prices, warmer weather and a higher average customer attrition rate of 1.9% in 2006 as compared to 1.2% in 2007, which reflects a 37% improvement. Our customer growth rate was negatively impacted by the downturn in the housing market during 2007; factors which are expected to continue to have a negative impact on customer growth in 2008. We continue to focus significant efforts in our distribution operations business on improving our net customer growth trends, despite the overall economy and the industry wide challenges of rising natural gas prices, competition from alternative fuels and declining natural gas usage per customer. These factors also impact customer growth at SouthStar where we are also focused on similar customer growth initiatives. We will continue to enter new markets and improve the overall profitability of its customers through a variety of enhancements to existing, and the implementation of new, product offerings and pricing plans. In 2007, SouthStar grew its average customer count by approximately 7,000 or a 1.3% increase over last year. 27 Table of Contents Return to normal weather and usage patterns In 2007, we saw average customer usage patterns related to natural gas price and weather conditions return to levels more consistent with historical averages. As the weather grew colder, compared to last year, and moved closer to 10 year average weather patterns primarily in Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia, we saw the conservation that occurred a year ago largely reverse itself and return to expected levels. Due to these factors, coupled with our targeted marketing and growth programs mentioned above, our overall throughput in 2007 at distribution operations increased 1% as compared to prior year and 3% at SouthStar for its customers in Georgia. While we saw these improvements in throughput and weather that was colder than last year by 10% in Maryland, 17% in New Jersey and 6% in Virginia, weather did not completely return to normal and consequently our earnings continue to be negatively impacted by warmer than normal weather. We attempt to stabilize and mitigate the impact to our earnings due to weather through hedging activities at SouthStar and through WNA regulatory mechanisms in distribution operations. While our hedging activities in 2007 at SouthStar largely offset the negative impact to earnings due to weather that was warmer than normal, distribution operations earnings were negatively impacted by $9 million due to weather that was warmer than normal and because the WNA regulatory mechanisms did not completely offset the negative impact to earnings from decreased consumption resulting from the warmer weather. These WNA regulatory mechanisms are most effective in reasonable temperature ranges relative to normal weather using historical averages due in part to their inherent design but also due to customer consumption patterns that are affected by weather conditions other than temperature. These other weather conditions include wind, cloud cover, precipitation and the duration of colder weather, among others, that are not captured in weather normalization adjustments, which are based primarily on average temperatures. There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. We continue to actively monitor these proposals and discussions because the results could negatively impact our operations through reduced demand for natural gas and increased costs to our business. While we are unable to predict the outcome and quantify any impacts from these discussions and proposals at this point, we are active in promoting natural gas as the cleanest and most efficient burning fossil fuel with the lowest carbon content as compared to oil and coal. Volatility in wholesale markets Lower volatility in the natural gas markets, as compared to last year, has limited Sequents asset optimization and arbitrage opportunities to generate operating margin in 2007. An important component of Sequents business is its ability to capture operating margin based on seasonal and locational spreads, both of which were significantly reduced in 2007 as compared to 2006. We continue to expect less volatility in the natural gas markets and, therefore, we expect Sequents abilities to capture economic value from asset optimization and arbitrage opportunities to be more consistent with those captured in 2007 as opposed to 2006 and 2005. Operational efficiency and cost control We continue to focus on operating our business as efficiently as possible, especially within our distribution operations and corporate segments through control of our operating costs. One of the key metrics we monitor in distribution operations is our operation and maintenance expenses per customer that was $145 per customer for 2007 as compared to $156 per customer in 2006, a 7% decrease year over year. This decrease was largely driven by a decrease in incentive compensation for employees at distribution operations and corporate as compared to last year due to lower payouts resulting from lower earnings per share in 2007 as compared to our AIP earning per share goals. Additionally in 2006 our earnings per share results were at the top end of the goals under the AIP, resulting in higher incentive compensation for 2006. We further utilize outside vendors to assist us with the execution of business processes that are ancillary to our delivery of natural gas and related to the performance of basic business functions. This allows us to control operating costs, increase the efficiency through which these functions are executed and improve our service levels to customers. Most recently, we partnered with third parties in India to provide certain call center operations, as well as certain support functions related to information technology, finance, supply chain and engineering. 28 Table of Contents New market growth and regulatory opportunities The four previous operating priorities require us to actively and continuously monitor the emerging issues and trends within our current operations and industry to allow us to take advantage of opportunities that complement and add value to our existing business operations. In 2007, we continued to expand Sequents operations into the western United States and Canada, as well as SouthStars operations into Ohio and Florida. Further, in October 2007, we acquired and have included within our wholesale services operating segment Compass Energy, which has enabled us to serve a broader geography of commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, we continued to focus our efforts around our storage business, particularly our Golden Triangle Storage underground natural gas storage project. We achieved a significant milestone in this project at the end of 2007 as the FERC issued an order granting a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the underground storage project and approving market based rates for the services Golden Triangle Storage will provide. In January 2008, we accepted the FERCs certificate and expect construction to begin in the first half of 2008. In distribution operations, we were also successful with certain regulatory initiatives that are critical to the fundamentals of our business as they help to preserve the long term success and earnings potential of our utility businesses. In September 2007, we received approval from the Georgia Commission on our capacity supply plan in Georgia, and a key part of that agreement was the ability to diversify our supply sources by gaining more access to the Elba Island LNG facility. As a result, we have negotiated an agreement with SNG to obtain an undivided interest in pipelines connecting our Georgia service territory to the Elba Island LNG facility and have filed a joint application with the FERC for approval of the project, which is expected to cost $22 million. In October 2007, the Georgia Commission approved the extension of the asset management agreement between Sequent and Atlanta Gas Light through March 2012. We are actively working with the respective commissions to renew or amend the existing agreements set to expire in 2008 in our other jurisdictions. In September 2007, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas WNA rider for commercial customers that applies to the 2007 and 2008 heating seasons. In Florida, we received approval from the Florida Commission in December 2007 to include the amortization of certain components of the purchase price we paid for Florida City Gas in our return on equity calculation for regulatory reporting purposes. Additionally, the Florida Commissions approval included provisions for a five year stay out. As a result, Florida City Gas base rates will not change during this period, except for unforeseen events beyond our control and the Florida Commission initiating base rate proceedings. In November 2007, Elkton Gas filed a base rate case with the Maryland Commission requesting a rate increase of less than $1 million. Starting in 2009 through 2011, we will be required to file base rate cases for Atlanta Gas Light, Virginia Natural Gas, Elizabethtown Gas and Chattanooga Gas. While we are unable to predict the outcome of these base rate proceedings, we will focus on incorporating and potentially proposing regulatory solutions into our base rate filings for many of the areas related to our key operation priorities as well as other emerging issues and trends impacting our utilities. Results of Operations Revenues We generate nearly all our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. We include in our consolidated revenues an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed, to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. The following table provides more information regarding the components of our operating revenues. In millions 2007 2006 2005 Residential $ 1,143 $ 1,127 $ 1,177 Commercial 500 460 452 Transportation 401 434 450 Industrial 250 310 412 Other 200 290 227 Total operating revenues $ 2,494 $ 2,621 $ 2,718 Operating margin and EBIT We evaluate the performance of our operating segments using the measures of operating margin and EBIT. We believe operating margin is a better indicator than operating revenues for the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of gas can vary significantly and is generally billed directly to our customers. We also consider operating margin to be a better indicator in our retail energy operations, wholesale services and energy investments segments since it is a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs. We believe EBIT is a useful measurement of our operating segments performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective, exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes, neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations. 29 Table of Contents Our operating margin and EBIT are not measures that are considered to be calculated in accordance with GAAP. You should not consider operating margin or EBIT an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, our operating performance than operating income or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and EBIT measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of our operating margin and EBIT to our operating income and net income, together with other consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

A reconciliation of operating margin and EBIT to our operating income and net income is contained in Results of Operations herein. (2) Includes intercompany eliminations 2007 compared to 2006 In 2007 our net income decreased by $1 million primarily due to decreased EBIT from wholesale services largely due to lower operating margin. This was offset by increased EBIT at distribution operations, retail energy operations and energy investments due to higher operating margin as compared to 2006. Additionally, distribution operations EBIT contribution increased due to lower operating expenses as compared to 2006. Our basic earnings per share increased by $0.01 primarily due to the reduction in the average number of shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. Our diluted earnings per share were flat. Operating margin Our operating margin in 2007, decreased $14 million or 1% primarily due to lower operating margin at our wholesale services segment. Distribution operations operating margin increased $13 million or 2% primarily due to a 21,000 or .9% increase in customers as compared to last year, a $2 million increase in base rates at Chattanooga Gas (effective January 1, 2007) and a $2 million increase in PRP operating revenues. Distribution operations operating margin was further increased by slightly overall higher customer usage of 3 Bcf or 1%. However, our customer usage was impacted by weather that, while colder than last year in some of our jurisdictions, was warmer than normal. Our WNA mechanisms in place to mitigate the loss of operating margin due to weather that was still warmer than normal did not fully offset such losses, resulting in a $9 million decrease in operating margin. Retail energy operations operating margin increased $32 million or 21%. This was primarily due to an $8 million increase in average customer usage in Georgia, a $2 million increase from the addition of approximately 7,000 or 1.3% customers, $3 million from the advancement into the Ohio market and $2 million in higher late payment fees. Retail energy operations operating margin was further positively impacted by the combination of retail price spreads and contributions from the optimization of storage and transportation assets and commodity risk management activities, as well as from a prior year LOCOM adjustment of $6 million to reduce weighted average inventory cost to market. Retail energy operations did not record a similar LOCOM adjustment in 2007 resulting in an increase in operating margin as compared to last year. Even though weather was 4% warmer than last year, retail energy operations use of weather derivatives largely offset the $2 million decline in operating margin due to warmer weather. Wholesale services operating margin decreased $62 million or 45%. This decrease is due to a $36 million reduction in reported hedge gains and a $46 million reduction in commercial activity due in part to reduced inventory storage spreads and lower volatility in the marketplace. These decreases were partially offset by a $20 million reduction in the required LOCOM adjustments to natural gas inventories for the year ended December 31, 2007, net of $3 million and $22 million in estimated hedging recoveries during 2007 and 2006, respectively. These are indicated in the following table. In millions 2007 2006 2005 Gain (loss) on storage hedges $ 12 $ 41 $ (7 ) Gain on transportation hedges 5 12 Commercial activity 61 107 102 Inventory LOCOM, net of hedging recoveries (1 ) (21 ) (3 ) Operating margin $ 77 $ 139 $ 92 32 Table of Contents The following graph presents the NYMEX forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2007, September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, for the period of January 2008 through December 2008, and reflects the prices at which wholesale services could buy natural gas at the Henry Hub for delivery in the same time period. NYMEX forward curve Wholesale services expected natural gas withdrawals from physical salt dome and reservoir storage are presented in the following table along with the operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal. Wholesale services expected operating revenues are net of the impact of regulatory sharing and reflect the amounts that it would expect to realize in future periods based on the inventory withdrawal schedule and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2007. Wholesale services storage inventory is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in an overall locked in margin, timing notwithstanding. Wholesale services physical salt dome and reservoir volumes are presented in NYMEX equivalent contract units of 10,000 million British thermal units (MMBtus). Three months ended Mar. 31, 2008 June 30, 2008 Dec.31, 2008 Total Salt dome (WACOG $6.70) 33 94 127 Reservoir (WACOG $6.20) 773 24 797 Total volumes 806 24 94 924 Expected operating revenues from physical inventory (in millions) $ 9 $ $ 2 $ 11 Energy investments operating margin increased $4 million or 11% primarily due to a $2 million increase in revenues at Jefferson Island as a result of increased interruptible margin opportunities and a $2 million increase at AGL Networks as a result of a larger customer base. Operating expenses Our operating expenses in 2007 decreased $15 million or 2% from 2006. The following table indicates the significant changes in our operating expenses. In millions Operating expenses for year ended Dec. 31, 2006 $ 651 Decreased incentive compensation costs at distribution operations due to not achieving AIP earnings goals (14 ) Decreased incentive compensation costs at wholesale services due to lower operating margin (13 ) Decreased bad debt expense at retail energy operations (3 ) Increased incentive compensation costs due to growth and improved operations at retail energy operations 3 Increased depreciation and amortization 6 Increased payroll and other operating costs at wholesale services due to continued expansion 7 Increased costs at retail energy operations due to customer care, marketing costs and higher payroll in support of customer and market growth initiatives 5 Other, net primarily at distribution operations due to pension, outside services and reduction in customer service expense (6 ) Operating expenses for year ended Dec. 31, 2007 $ 636 Our other income increased by $5 million. This was primarily due to lower charitable contributions in 2007 at distribution operations and retail energy operations. Interest expense The increased interest expense of $2 million or 2% in 2007 was due primarily to higher short term interest rates and a $3 million premium paid for the early redemption of the $75 million notes payable to AGL Capital Trust I, which was recorded as interest expense in 2007. As indicated in the following table, this was partially offset by lower average debt, primarily from reduced commercial paper borrowings for most of 2007. In millions 2007 2006 Change Interest expense $ 125 $ 123 $ 2 Average debt outstanding (1) $ 1,967 $ 2,023 $ (56 ) Average rate (2) 6.4 % 6.1 % 0.3 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. (2) Excluding $3 million premium paid for early redemption of debt, average rate in 2007 would have been 6.2%. Income tax expense The decrease in income tax expense of $2 million or 2% in 2007, compared to the same period in 2006 was primarily due to lower consolidated earnings and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 37.6% in 2007 compared to an effective tax rate of 37.8% in 2006. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily a result of our 2007 investment in a guaranteed affordable housing tax credit fund. We expect our effective tax rate in 2008 to remain consistent with our 2007 rate. For more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective rate, see Note 8. 33 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 In 2006 our net income increased by $19 million or 10%, our basic earnings per share increased by $0.23 or 9% and our diluted earnings per share increased by $0.24. This was primarily due to increased EBIT of $41 million in wholesale services which primarily reflected the recognition of unrealized hedge gains during 2006, as forward NYMEX prices declined significantly. In contrast, NYMEX price increases experienced during 2005 had the opposite effect, but to a lesser extent. In the distribution operations segment, EBIT improved by $11 million, due to reduced operating expenses of $19 million, offset by lower operating margin of $7 million. Our retail energy operations segments EBIT was flat compared to 2005. The energy investments segments EBIT was down $9 million primarily due to the loss of EBIT contributions as the result of the sale in 2005 of certain assets that were originally acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI. Operating margin Our operating margin increased $47 million or 4% from 2005. This was primarily due to increases at wholesale services and retail energy operations offset by declines at distribution operations. Wholesale services increased its operating margin $47 million or 51% as compared to 2005 due to significant arbitrage opportunities brought on by natural gas price volatility and periods of extreme weather. Forward NYMEX prices decreased during 2006, especially during the third and fourth quarters, and this resulted in the wholesale services segment recognizing $41 million of storage hedge gains in 2006, compared to the recognition of $7 million of storage hedge losses in 2005. In addition, wholesale services recognized $12 million in gains associated with the financial instruments used to hedge its transportation capacity. There were no significant gains or losses associated with transportation hedges recognized in the prior period. Consequently, wholesale services experienced a net change of $60 million from its hedging activities for 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, as a result of decreasing NYMEX prices the wholesale services segment evaluated the weighted average cost of its natural gas inventory and recorded LOCOM adjustments totaling $43 million in 2006; however, as inventory was physically withdrawn from storage during the year, $22 million of the 2006 adjustments were recovered and reflected in 2006 operating revenues when the original economic results were realized as the related hedging derivatives were settled. In 2005, wholesale services recorded LOCOM adjustments of $3 million. The results of the wholesale services segment also reflect improved commercial activities of approximately $5 million associated with larger seasonal storage spreads during the first half of 2006 and above average temperatures during the late summer months. These conditions offset the impacts of mild weather during the winter and early summer and the lower level of market volatility that we experienced compared to the hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. Retail energy operations operating margin increased by $10 million or 7% principally driven by improved retail price spreads, higher contributions from the optimization of storage and transportation assets and effective risk management, and an increase of approximately 2,000 average customers in 2006 as compared to 2005. These factors contributed $34 million in operating margin contributions, but was offset by $16 million in lower operating margin from customer conservation and lower consumption due to weather that was approximately 10% warmer than 2005, net of $5 million in net gains on weather derivatives. Operating margin was further negatively impacted by an adjustment in 2006 of $6 million to reduce inventory to market for which no LOCOM adjustment was recorded in 2005, and from $2 million in lower late payment fees and interruptible operating margin contributions. Operating margin for the distribution operations segment decreased $7 million or 1% primarily from warmer weather affecting customer usage and from our exiting the New Jersey and Florida appliance businesses. The operating margin at Elizabethtown Gas decreased $3 million with 17% warmer weather than in 2005. Virginia Natural Gas operating margin decreased $4 million with 17% warmer weather, and the operating margin at Florida City Gas decreased $2 million with 15% warmer weather. Further, our exiting of the New Jersey and Florida appliance businesses reduced operating margin by $3 million. This reduction was partially offset by a net increase in operating margin at Atlanta Gas Light of $6 million consisting of $5 million in gas storage carrying costs from higher average inventory balances and $2 million in PRP revenues from the continuing expenditures under the program, offset primarily by $2 million as a result of the effect of the Georgia Commissions June 2005 Rate Order. Operating margin at energy investments decreased $4 million or 10% largely due to the loss of $9 million of operating margin contributions from certain assets we acquired with the 2004 acquisition of NUI but sold in 2005. Jefferson Islands operating margin increased by $1 million compared to the prior year, in part due to increases in both firm and interruptible operating margin opportunities. AGL Networks operating margin increased by $1 million compared to the prior year due to a larger customer base. Pivotal Propane contributed a $2 million increase primarily in the first quarter of 2006 as it did not become operational until April 2005. 34 Table of Contents Operating expenses Our operating expenses increased $1 million or 0.2% from the same period in 2005. The following table sets forth the significant components of operating expenses: In millions Operating expenses for 2005 $ 650 Increased payroll, incentive compensation and corporate overhead allocated costs at wholesale services to support growth 7 Increased bad debt expenses at retail energy operations and distribution operations 4 Lower expenses resulting from energy investment assets sold in 2005 (8 ) Lower expenses at distribution operations related to workforce and facilities restructurings in 2005 and 2006 (15 ) Increased depreciation and amortization 5 Other 8 Operating expenses for 2006 $ 651 Interest expense Interest expense for 2006 increased by $14 million or 13% as compared to 2005. As indicated in the following table, higher short term interest rates and higher debt outstanding combined to increase our interest expense in 2006 relative to the previous year. The increase of $200 million in average debt outstanding for 2006 compared to 2005 was due to additional debt incurred as a result of higher working capital requirements. In millions 2006 2005 Change Total interest expense $ 123 $ 109 $ 14 Average debt outstanding (1) 2,023 1,823 200 Average interest rate 6.1 % 6.0 % 0.1 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. Income tax expense The increase in income tax expense of $12 million or 10% for 2006 compared to 2005 reflected additional income taxes primarily due to higher corporate earnings year over year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, short term borrowings under our commercial paper program (which is supported by our Credit Facility) and borrowings under lines of credit. Additionally from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets through our existing shelf registration statement to fund our liquidity and capital resource needs. We believe these sources will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, construction expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments, common share repurchases and other cash needs. Our issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and the SEC. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation. We will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements. The following table provides a summary of our operating, investing and financing activities for the last three years. In millions 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 376 $ 354 $ 80 Investing activities (253 ) (248 ) (194 ) Financing activities (122 ) (118 ) 97 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1 $ (12 ) $ (17 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities We prepare our statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in risk management assets and liabilities, undistributed earnings from equity investments, deferred income taxes and changes in the consolidated balance sheet for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. Our operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the first and fourth quarters of each year. As a result of this seasonality, our natural gas inventories, which usually peak on November 1 and largely are drawn down in the heating season, provide a source of cash as this asset is used to satisfy winter sales demand. The establishment and price fluctuations of our natural gas inventories which meet customer demand during the winter heating season can cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations from period to period and are reflected in changes to our working capital. 35 Table of Contents Year over year changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our distribution operations, retail energy operations and wholesale services segments resulting from the impact of weather, the price of natural gas, the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries as our business has grown and prices for natural gas have increased. The increase in natural gas prices directly impacts the cost of gas stored in inventory. 2007 compared to 2006 In 2007, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $376 million, an increase of $22 million or 6% from 2006. The increase was due to higher realized gains on our energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities and lower cash requirements for our natural gas inventories due to price and inventory volume fluctuations. This was offset by increased cash payments for income taxes due to realized gains on our energy marketing and risk management activities and higher working capital requirements. 2006 compared to 2005 In 2006, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $354 million, an increase of $274 million or 343% from 2005. The increase was primarily a result of higher earnings in 2006 of $19 million and the recovery of working capital during 2006 that was deployed in late 2005 due to higher natural gas commodity prices and colder weather in the 2005 heating season. A primary contributor to the recovery of working capital was a $157 million decrease in the amount of natural gas inventory purchases by Sequent and our utilities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our investing activities consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) expenditures. The majority of our PP&E expenditures are within our distribution operations segment, which includes our investments in new construction and infrastructure improvements. Our estimated PP&E expenditures of approximately $400 million in 2008 and actual PP&E expenditures of $259 million in 2007, $253 million in 2006 and $267 million in 2005 are presented in the following chart. Our estimated expenditures in 2008 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the base business and natural gas storage categories. In determining whether to proceed with these projects, we evaluate such discretionary capital projects in relation to a number of factors including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. As such, we will make adjustments to these discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors. Our estimated and actual PP&E expenditures are shown with the following categories. Base business new construction and infrastructure improvements at our distribution operations segment Natural gas storage salt dome cavern expansions at Golden Triangle and Jefferson Island Hampton Roads Virginia Natural Gas pipeline project, which will connect its northern and southern systems PRP Atlanta Gas Lights program to replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system in Georgia SNG a 250 mile pipeline in Georgia acquired from Southern Natural Gas (SNG) in 2005 Other primarily includes information technology, building and leasehold improvements and AGL Networks telecommunication expenditures In 2007, our PP&E expenditures were $6 million or 2% higher than in 2006. This was primarily due to an increase in PRP expenditures of $10 million as we replaced larger diameter pipe in more densely populated areas and $5 million in expenditures for the Hampton Roads project. This was offset by decreased expenditures of $4 million on our storage projects. The decrease of $14 million or 5% in PP&E expenditures in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the SNG pipeline acquisition of $32 million, which occurred in 2005, and $17 million in reduced PRP expenditures, primarily as a result of the June 2005 agreement with the Georgia Commission, which extended the PRP program by five years. This was offset by increased base business expenditures of $19 million, primarily as our utilities expanded their new construction investments. We also incurred higher information technology expenditures of $13 million, which included $5 million at retail energy operations, primarily due to the implementation of a new energy trading and risk management system and enhancements to the retail billing system. Additionally in 2006, we spent $12 million in additional PP&E expenditures at Jefferson Island as it began work on a salt dome storage expansion project which would add a third and fourth storage cavern. In 2005, our cash flows from investing activities were positively impacted as we sold our 50% interest in Saltville Gas Storage Company (Saltville) and associated subsidiaries for $66 million to a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation. We acquired Saltville through our acquisition of NUI in 2004. 36 Table of Contents Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our financing activities are primarily composed of borrowings and payments of short term debt, payments of medium term notes, and notes payable to AGL Capital Trust I and II, borrowings of senior notes, distributions to minority interests, cash dividends on our common stock issuances, purchases and issuances of treasury shares and the use of interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk. Our capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of equity and debt securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, appropriate mix of debt with fixed to floating interest rates (our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt), as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities. As of December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt was $840 million or 37% of our total debt, compared to $733 million or 34% as of December 31, 2006. The increased variable rate debt was principally due to higher commercial paper borrowings. As of December 31, 2007, our commercial paper borrowings were $58 million or 11% higher than the same time last year, primarily a result of a $42 million increase in common share repurchases in 2007 and slightly higher working capital needs. For more information on our debt, see Note 6. Credit Ratings We also work to maintain or improve our credit ratings on our debt to manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms. Factors we consider important in assessing our credit ratings include our balance sheet leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. Improvements in our operating performance led to our credit outlook being raised from negative to stable by S&P in late 2007. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2007. S&P Moodys Fitch Corporate rating A Commercial paper A 2 P 2 F 2 Senior unsecured BBB+ Baa1 A Ratings outlook Stable Stable Stable Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the rating agencies downgrade our ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease. Default Events Our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. Our most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, and acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Our Credit Facilitys financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70%; however, our goal is to maintain this ratio at levels between 50% and 60%. We are currently in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants. We believe that accomplishing these capitalization objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and to allow us access to capital at reasonable costs. The components of our capital structure, as of the dates indicated, are summarized in the following table. In millions Dec. 31, 2007 Dec. 31, 2006 Short term debt $ 580 15 % $ 539 14 % Long term debt (1) 1,674 43 1,622 43 Total debt 2,254 58 2,161 57 Common shareholders equity 1,661 42 1,609 43 Total capitalization $ 3,915 100 % $ 3,770 100 % (1) Net of interest rate swaps. 37 Table of Contents Short term Debt Our short term debt is composed of borrowings under our commercial paper program, lines of credit at Sequent, SouthStar and Pivotal Utility, the current portion of our medium term notes (for 2006) and the current portion of our capital leases. Our short term debt financing generally increases between June and December because our payments for natural gas and pipeline capacity are generally made to suppliers prior to the collection of accounts receivable from our customers. We typically reduce short term debt balances in the spring because a significant portion of our current assets are converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season. In June and August 2007 we extended Sequents $45 million unsecured lines of credit through June ($25 million) and August ($20 million) 2008. Sequents lines of credit are used solely for the posting of margin deposits for NYMEX transactions. In August 2007, we extended Pivotal Utilitys $20 million unsecured line of credit through August 2008. This line of credit supports Elizabethtown Gas hedging program and is used solely for the posting of margin deposits. These lines of credit bear interest at the federal funds effective rate plus 0.4% and are unconditionally guaranteed by us. Under the terms of our Credit Facility, which expires in August 2011, the aggregate principal amount available is $1 billion and we can request an option to increase the aggregate principal amount available for borrowing to $1.25 billion on not more than three occasions during each calendar year. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. However, the availability of borrowings and unused credit under our Credit Facility is limited and subject to conditions specified within the Credit Facility, which we currently meet. These conditions include: the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70%. As of December 31, 2007, our ratio of total debt of 58% to total capitalization was within our targeted and required ranges, and was consistent with our ratio of 57% at December 31, 2006 the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the agreement Long term Debt Our long term debt matures more than one year from the balance sheet date and consists of medium term notes, senior notes, gas facility revenue bonds, and capital leases. The following represents our long term debt activity in 2007. In January 2007, we used proceeds from the sale of commercial paper to redeem $11 million of 7% medium term notes previously scheduled to mature in January 2015. In June 2007 we refinanced $55 million of our gas facility revenue bonds due June 2032.The original bonds had a fixed interest rate of 5.7% per year and were refinanced with $55 million of adjustable rate gas facility revenue bonds. The maturity date of these bonds remains June 2032 and there is a 35 day auction period where the interest rate adjusts every 35 days. The interest rate at December 31, 2007, was 4.7%. In July 2007, we used the proceeds from the sale of commercial paper to pay to AGL Capital Trust I the $75 million principal amount of 8.17% junior subordinated debentures plus a $3 million premium for early redemption of the junior subordinated debentures, and to pay a $2 million note representing our common securities interest in AGL Capital Trust I. In December 2007, AGL Capital issued $125 million of 6.375% senior notes. The senior notes are part of a series of notes issued by AGL Capital in June 2006. Both sets of notes are now part of a single series with an aggregate of $300 million in principal outstanding. The proceeds of the note issuance, equal to approximately $123 million, were used to pay down short term indebtedness incurred under our commercial paper program. Minority Interest As a result of our consolidation of SouthStars accounts effective January 1, 2004, we recorded Piedmonts portion of SouthStars contributed capital as a minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets. A cash distribution of $23 million in 2007, $22 million in 2006 and $19 million in 2005 for SouthStars dividend distributions to Piedmont were recorded in our consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. Dividends on Common Stock Our $12 million or 11% increase in common stock dividend payments in 2007 compared to 2006, and $11 million or 11% increase in payments in 2006 compared to 2005, resulted from increases in the amount of our quarterly common stock dividends per share. 38 Table of Contents In 2007, our dividend payout ratio was 60%. This is an increase of 11% from our payout ratio of 54% in 2006. We expect that our dividend payout ratio will remain consistent with the dividend payout ratios of our peer companies, which is currently in a range of 60% to 65%. Our diluted earnings per share and dividends declared per share along with our payout ratio for the last three years are presented in the following chart. For information about restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, see Note 5 Common Shareholders Equity. Share Repurchases In March 2001 our Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to 600,000 shares of our common stock to be used for issuances under the Officer Incentive Plan. During 2007, we purchased 10,667 shares. As of December 31, 2007, we had purchased a total 297,234 shares, leaving 302,766 shares available for purchase. In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to purchase up to 8 million shares of our outstanding common stock over a five year period. These purchases are intended principally to offset share issuances under our employee and non employee director incentive compensation plans and our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases under this program may be made in the open market or in private transactions at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will purchase, and we can terminate or limit the program at any time. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $39.56 per share and an aggregate cost of $80 million. During the same period in 2006, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost of $36.67 per share and an aggregate cost of $38 million. This represented an increase of $42 million or 111% from last year. We hold the purchased shares as treasury shares. For more information on our share repurchases see Item 5 Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Shelf Registration In August 2007, we filed a new shelf registration with the SEC. The debt securities and related guarantees will be issued by AGL Capital under an indenture dated as of February 20, 2001, as supplemented and modified, as necessary, among AGL Capital, AGL Resources and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The indenture provides for the issuance from time to time of debt securities in an unlimited dollar amount and an unlimited number of series subject to our Credit Facilitys financial covenants related to total debt to total capitalization . The debt securities will be guaranteed by AGL Resources. This replaces the previous shelf registration, filed in October 2004, which had $782 million available to be issued. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligation payments such as debt and lease agreements, and commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2007. 39 Table of Contents 2009 & 2011 & 2013 & In millions Total 2008 2010 2012 thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,674 $ $ 2 $ 315 $ 1,357 Short term debt 580 580 ERC (1) 107 10 34 53 10 PRP costs (1) 245 55 112 60 18 Total $ 2,606 $ 645 $ 148 $ 428 $ 1,385 (1) Includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms. 2009 & 2011 & 2013 & In millions Total 2008 2010 2012 thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations and commitments (1): Interest charges (2) $ 1,176 $ 100 $ 200 $ 157 $ 719 Pipeline charges, storage capacity and gas supply (3) 1,792 456 637 348 351 Operating leases 154 26 50 34 44 Standby letters of credit, performance/surety bonds 30 24 6 Asset management agreements (4) 24 8 8 8 Total $ 3,176 $ 614 $ 901 $ 547 $ 1,114 (1) In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these items are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. (2) Floating rate debt is based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2007 and the maturity of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2007 we have $39 million of accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet that will be paid in 2008. (3) Charges recoverable through a PGA mechanism or alternatively billed to Marketers. Also includes demand charges associated with Sequent. (4) Represent fixed fee payments for Sequents asset management agreements between Atlanta Gas Light ($4 million) and Elizabethtown Gas ($4 million). As of December 31, 2007, $1 million of fixed fee payments are accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, which will be paid in 2008. Pipeline Charges, Storage Capacity and Gas Supply Contracts. A subsidiary of NUI entered into two 20 year agreements for the firm transportation and storage of natural gas during 2003 with annual aggregate demand charges of approximately $5 million. As a result of our acquisition of NUI and accordance with SFAS 141, we valued the contracts at fair value and established a long term liability for the excess liability that will be amortized over the remaining lives of the contracts. The gas supply amount includes SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 1.3 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2007, and is valued at $98 million. Operating leases. We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with SFAS 13. However, this accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flow from operating and financing activities. Standby letters of credit and surety bonds. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows. Pension and Postretirement Obligations We calculate any required pension contributions using the projected unit credit cost method. Under this method, we were not required to and did not make any pension contribution during 2007. During 2006, we voluntarily contributed $5 million to the AGL Resources Inc. Retirement Plan. The state regulatory commissions have phase ins that defer a portion of the postretirement benefit expense for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $12 million as of December 31, 2007 and $13 million as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we recorded a regulatory liability of $4 million as of December 31, 2007 and $4 million as of December 31, 2006 for our expected expenses under the AGL Postretirement Plan. See Note 3 Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information about our pension and postretirement plans. 40 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from our estimates. Each of the following critical accounting policies involves complex situations requiring a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. Pipeline Replacement Program Liabilities Atlanta Gas Light was ordered by the Georgia Commission (through a joint stipulation and a subsequent settlement agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the Commission staff) to undertake a PRP that would replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system. Approximately 103 miles of cast iron and 533 miles of bare steel pipe still require replacement. If Atlanta Gas Light does not perform in accordance with the initial and amended PRP stipulation, it can be assessed certain nonperformance penalties. However to date, Atlanta Gas Light is in full compliance. The stipulation also provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred under the program, which Atlanta Gas Light has recorded as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset has two components: the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders The determination of future expected costs associated with our PRP involves judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the future expected costs are projected capital expenditure spending, including labor and material costs, and the remaining infrastructure footage to be replaced for the remaining years of the program. We recorded a long term liability of $190 million as of December 31, 2007 and $202 million as of December 31, 2006, which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the PRP. As of December 31, 2007, we had recorded a current liability of $55 million, representing expected PRP expenditures for the next 12 months. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. If Atlanta Gas Lights PRP expenditures, subject to future recovery, were $10 million higher or lower its incremental expected annual revenues would have changed by approximately $1 million. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We historically reported estimates of future remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. As we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter cleanup contracts, we are increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of the remediation program. These estimates contain various engineering uncertainties, and we continuously attempt to refine and update these engineering estimates. Our latest available estimate as of December 31, 2007 for those elements of the remediation program with in place contracts or engineering cost estimates is $15 million for Atlanta Gas Lights Georgia and Florida sites. This is an increase of $2 million from the December 31, 2006 estimate of projected engineering and in place contracts, resulting from increased cost estimates during 2007. For elements of the remediation program where Atlanta Gas Light still cannot perform engineering cost estimates, considerable variability remains in available estimates. The estimated remaining cost of future actions at these sites is $20 million, which includes approximately $1 million in estimates of certain other costs it pays related to administering the remediation program and remediation of sites currently in the investigation phase. Beyond 2009, these costs cannot be estimated. As of December 31, 2007, we have recorded a liability of $35 million. Atlanta Gas Lights environmental remediation liability is included in its corresponding regulatory asset. Atlanta Gas Lights estimate does not include other potential expenses, such as unasserted property damage, personal injury or natural resource damage claims, unbudgeted legal expenses, or other costs for which it may be held liable but with respect to which the amount cannot be reasonably forecast. Atlanta Gas Lights recovery of environmental remediation costs is subject to review by the Georgia Commission, which may seek to disallow the recovery of some expenses. In New Jersey, Elizabethtown Gas is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Although the actual total cost of future environmental investigation and remediation efforts cannot be estimated with precision, the range of reasonably probable costs is $61 million to $119 million. As of December 31, 2007, we have recorded a liability of $61 million. 41 Table of Contents The New Jersey Commission has authorized Elizabethtown Gas to recover prudently incurred remediation costs for the New Jersey properties through its remediation adjustment clause. As a result, Elizabethtown Gas has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $66 million, inclusive of interest, as of December 31, 2007, reflecting the future recovery of both incurred costs and future remediation liabilities in the state of New Jersey. Elizabethtown Gas has also been successful in recovering a portion of remediation costs incurred in New Jersey from its insurance carriers and continues to pursue additional recovery. As of December 31, 2007, the variation between the amounts of the environmental remediation cost liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and the associated regulatory asset is due to expenditures for environmental investigation and remediation exceeding recoveries from ratepayers and insurance carriers. We also own several former NUI remediation sites located outside of New Jersey. One site, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, is subject to an order by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Preliminary estimates for investigation and remediation costs range from $11 million to $20 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had recorded a liability of $11 million related to this site. There is one other site in North Carolina where investigation and remediation is probable, although no regulatory order exists and we do not believe costs associated with this site can be reasonably estimated. In addition, there are as many as six other sites with which NUI had some association, although no basis for liability has been asserted. We do not believe that costs to investigate and remediate these sites, if any, can be reasonably estimated at this time. With respect to these costs, we currently pursue or intend to pursue recovery from ratepayers, former owners and operators and insurance carriers. Although we have been successful in recovering a portion of these remediation costs from our insurance carriers, we are not able to express a belief as to the success of additional recovery efforts. We are working with the regulatory agencies to manage our remediation costs so as to mitigate the impact of such costs on both ratepayers and shareholders. Derivatives and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as updated by SFAS 149, established accounting and reporting standards which require that every derivative financial instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for and is designated as a normal purchase and sale, it is exempted from the fair value accounting treatment of SFAS 133, as updated by SFAS 149, and is accounted for using traditional accrual accounting. SFAS 133 requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, SFAS 133 allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI until maturity in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, SFAS 133 requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. SFAS 133 applies to treasury locks and interest rate swaps executed by AGL Capital and gas commodity contracts executed by Sequent and SouthStar. SFAS 133 also applies to gas commodity contracts executed by Elizabethtown Gas under a New Jersey Commission authorized hedging program that requires gains and losses on these derivatives are reflected in purchased gas costs and ultimately billed to customers. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 2 Financial Instruments and Risk Management and Item 1 Business. Commodity related Derivative Instruments We are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. Through Sequent and SouthStar, we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas. Sequent recognizes the change in value of a derivative instrument as an unrealized gain or loss in revenues in the period when the market value of the instrument changes. Sequent recognizes cash inflows and outflows associated with the settlement of its risk management activities in operating cash flows, and reports these settlements as receivables and payables in the balance sheet separately from the risk management activities reported as energy marketing receivables and trade payables. We attempt to mitigate substantially all our commodity price risk associated with Sequents natural gas storage portfolio and lock in the economic margin at the time we enter into purchase transactions for our stored natural gas. We purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price we pay plus storage costs is less than the market price we could receive in the future. We lock in the economic margin by selling NYMEX futures contracts or other over the counter derivatives in the forward months corresponding with our withdrawal periods. We use contracts to sell natural gas at that future price to lock in the operating margin we will ultimately realize when the stored natural gas is actually sold. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS 133. 42 Table of Contents The purchase, storage and sale of natural gas are accounted for differently from the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. That difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported operating margin, even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date we entered into the transactions. We do not currently use hedge accounting under SFAS 133 to account for this activity. Natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the lower of average cost or market value. Under current accounting guidance, we recognize a loss in any period when the market price for natural gas is lower than the carrying amount of our purchased natural gas inventory. Costs to store the natural gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred. We recognize revenues and cost of natural gas sold in our statement of consolidated income in the period we sell gas and it is delivered out of the storage facility. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the operating margin upon the sale of stored natural gas are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change. This difference in accounting the lower of average cost or market basis for our storage inventory versus the fair value accounting for the derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk can and does result in volatility in our reported earnings. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of storage inventory will be substantially offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in realization of the economic profit margin we expected when we entered into the transactions. This accounting difference causes Sequents earnings on its storage positions to be affected by natural gas price changes, even though the economic profits remain essentially unchanged. SouthStar also uses derivative instruments to manage exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStars objective for holding these derivatives is to minimize volatility in wholesale commodity natural gas prices. A portion of SouthStars derivative transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. Derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings in the same period the underlying hedged item is reflected in the income statement. As of December 31, 2007, the ending balance in OCI for derivative transactions designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133 was a gain of $3 million, net of minority interest and taxes. Any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset the losses or gains on the hedged item, is recorded into earnings in the period in which it occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. SouthStars remaining derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. Therefore, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the period of change. SouthStar also enters into weather derivative instruments in order to preserve operating margins in the event of warmer than normal weather in the winter months. These contracts are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the guidance of EITF 99 02. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings in the period of change. The weather derivative contracts contain strike amount provisions based on cumulative heating degree days for the covered periods. In 2007 and 2006, SouthStar entered into weather derivatives (swaps and options) for the respective winter heating seasons, primarily from November through March. As of December 31, 2007, SouthStar recorded a current asset of $5 million for this hedging activity. Contingencies Our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities, including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, rate matters, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with SFAS 5. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates can be, and often are, revised either negatively or positively, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension an d other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. We annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. 43 Table of Contents The discount rate is used principally to calculate the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate which we have determined to be 6.4% at December 31, 2007, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on Moodys Corporate AA long term bond rate of 5.9% and the Citigroup Pension Liability rate of 6.5% at December 31, 2007. We further use these market indices as a comparison to a single equivalent discount rate derived with the assistance of our actuarial advisors. This analysis as of December 31, 2007 produced a single equivalent discount rate of 6.5%. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods. The expected long term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that years annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs. Prior to 2006, we estimated the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based on our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. However, starting in 2006, our postretirement plans have been capped at 2.5% for increases in health care costs. Consequently, a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate does not materially affect the periodic benefit cost for our postretirement plans. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase our accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4 million. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease our accumulated projected benefit obligation by $4 million. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon an annual review of participant census information as of the measurement date. At December 31, 2007, our pension and postretirement liability decreased by approximately $45 million, primarily resulting from an after tax gain to OCI of $24 million ($40 million before tax), $9 million in benefit payments that we funded offset by $4 million in net pension and postretirement benefit costs we recorded in 2007. These changes reflect our funding contributions to the plan, benefit payments out of the plans, and updated valuations for the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and plan assets. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), as the primary factors that drive the value of our unfunded ABO are the assumed discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. Additionally, equity market performance has a significant effect on our market related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five year moving weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense. See Note 3, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information on our pension and postretirement plans, which includes our investment policies and strategies, target allocation ranges and weighted average asset allocations for 2007 and 2006. 44 Table of Contents The actual return on our pension plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets of 9% will have an impact on our ABO as of December 31, 2008 and our pension expense for 2008. We are unable to determine how this actual return on plan assets will affect future ABO and pension expense, as actuarial assumptions and differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are determined at the time we complete our actuarial evaluation as of December 31, 2008. Our actual returns may also be positively or negatively impacted as a result of future performance in the equity and bond markets. The following tables illustrate the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, as discussed previously, while holding all other assumptions constant. AGL Resources Inc. Retirement and Postretirement Plans In millions Pension Benefits Health and Life Benefits Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Increase (decrease) in cost Increase (decrease) in obligation Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1 % $ / $ (3)/3 Discount rate +/ 1 % (40)/45 (4)/4 Healthcare cost trend rate +/ 1 % $ 4/(4) $ / NUI Corporation Retirement Plan In millions Pension Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Benefits Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1 % $ / $ (1)/1 Discount rate +/ 1 % (5)/5 /(1) Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the MRVPA. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. In addition to the assumptions listed above, the measurement of the plans obligations and costs depend on other factors such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans, earnings on the plans assets and mortality rates. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109 and FIN 48 which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 and FIN 48 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. At the date of adoption and as of December 31, 2007, we did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Our net long term deferred tax liability totaled $566 million at December 31, 2007 (see Note 8 Income Taxes). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our income tax returns. For state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had a $3 million valuation allowance on $53 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. Accounting Developments SFAS 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. However, it eliminates inconsistencies in the guidance provided in previous accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year. All valuation adjustments will be recognized as cumulative effect adjustments to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which SFAS 157 is initially applied. In December 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, at least annually. We will adopt SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008, for our financial assets and liabilities, which primarily consists of derivatives we record in accordance with SFAS 133, and on January 1, 2009, for our non financial assets and liabilities. For our financial assets and liabilities, we expect that our adoption of SFAS 157 will primarily impact our disclosures and not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We are currently evaluating the impact with respect to our non financial assets and liabilities. 45 Table of Contents SFAS 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, but is not required to be adopted. SFAS 159 establishes a framework for measuring fair value for eligible financial assets and liabilities with the intention of reducing earnings volatility. We currently have no financial assets or liabilities eligible for this treatment and have no plans to adopt SFAS 159. SFAS 160 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. SFAS 160 will require us to present our minority interest, to be referred to as a noncontrolling interest, separately within the capitalization section of our consolidated balance sheet. We will adopt SFAS 160 as of January 1, 2009. FIN 39 was issued in March 1992 and provides guidance related to offsetting payable and receivable amounts related to certain contracts, including derivative contracts. It was effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December 15, 1993. FSP FIN 39 1 was issued in April 2007 and is effective for us on January 1, 2008. FIN 39 1 amends FIN 39 and allows a company to elect to report certain derivative assets and liabilities subject to master netting agreements on either a gross basis or net basis on the balance sheet. The guidance also addresses reporting of collateral amounts relating to the netting agreements. We enter into derivative contracts, but FSP FIN 39 1 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and credit. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of natural gas. Interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations and in wholesale services. Our Risk Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with, and adherence to, the terms within these policies, including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels. Our RMC consists of members of senior management who monitor open commodity price risk positions and other types of risk, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities. It is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the RMC to perform its monitoring functions. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatments are described in further detail in Note 2, Financial Instruments and Risk Management. Commodity Price Risk Retail Energy Operations SouthStars use of derivatives is governed by a risk management policy, approved and monitored by its Risk and Asset Management Committee, which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities SouthStar generates operating margin from the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions and derivative instruments aimed at managing exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStar uses these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail commodity prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins. We have designated a portion of SouthStars derivative transactions as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS 133. We record derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassify them into earnings in the same period as the underlying hedged item occurs and is recorded in earnings. We record any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset and are greater than the losses or gains on the hedged item, in cost of gas in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. We have not designated the remainder of SouthStars derivative instruments as hedges under SFAS 133 and, accordingly, we record changes in their fair value in earnings in the period of change. 46 Table of Contents SouthStar recorded a net unrealized loss related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized in its energy marketing and risk management activities of $7 million during 2007, $14 million of unrealized gains during 2006 and unrealized losses of $4 million during 2005. The following tables illustrate the change in the net fair value of the derivative instruments and energy trading contracts during 2007, 2006 and 2005 and provide details of the net fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

SouthStar routinely utilizes various types of financial and other instruments to mitigate certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and over the counter energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and swap agreements. The following table includes the fair values and average values of SouthStars energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. SouthStar bases the average values on monthly averages for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

A 95% confidence interval means there is a 5% confidence that the actual loss in portfolio value will be greater than the calculated VaR value over the holding period. We calculate VaR based on the variance covariance technique. This technique requires several assumptions for the basis of the calculation, such as price distribution, price volatility, confidence interval and holding period. Our VaR may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because, although VaR is a common metric in the energy industry, there is no established industry standard for calculating VaR or for the assumptions underlying such calculations. SouthStars portfolio of positions for 2007 and 2006, had annual average 1 day holding period VaRs of less than $100,000, and its high, low and period end 1 day holding period VaR were immaterial. Wholesale Services Sequent routinely uses various types of financial and other instruments to mitigate certain commodity price risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and over the counter energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and financial swap agreements. Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities We account for derivative transactions in connection with Sequents energy marketing activities on a fair value basis in accordance with SFAS 133. We record derivative energy commodity contracts (including both physical transactions and financial instruments) at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value reflected in our earnings in the period of change. Sequents energy trading contracts are recorded on an accrual basis as required under the EITF 02 03 rescission of EITF 98 10, unless they are derivatives that must be recorded at fair value under SFAS 133. Sequent recorded a net unrealized loss related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized in its energy marketing and risk management activities and contract settlement of $62 million during 2007, $132 million of unrealized gains during 2006 and unrealized losses of $30 million during 2005. The following tables illustrate the change in the net fair value of Sequents derivative instruments and energy trading contracts during 2007, 2006 and 2005 and provide details of the net fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. 47 Table of Contents In millions 2007 2006 2005 Net fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of period $ 119 $ (13 ) $ 17 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during period (102 ) 17 (47 ) Change in net fair value of contracts 40 115 17 Net fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period $ 57 $ 119 $ (13 ) The sources of Sequents net fair value at December 31, 2007, are as follows.

The following table includes the fair values and average values of Sequents energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. Sequent bases the average values on monthly averages for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Similar to SouthStar, Sequent uses a 1 day holding period and a 95% confidence interval to evaluate its VaR exposure. Sequents open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management, including the chief risk officer. Because Sequent generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures and over the counter markets, its open exposure is generally minimal, permitting Sequent to operate within relatively low VaR limits. Sequent employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risks of its open positions. Sequents management actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR. Sequent continues to maintain a relatively matched book, where its total buy volume is close to its sell volume, with minimal open commodity risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a 1 day holding period for all positions, Sequents portfolio of positions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 had the following 1 day holding period VaRs. In millions 2007 2006 2005 Period end $ 1.2 $ 1.3 $ 0.6 12 month average 1.3 1.2 0.4 High 2.3 2.5 1.1 Low (1) 0.7 0.7 0.0 (1) $0.0 values represent amounts less than $0.1 million. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows. We manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on $840 million of variable rate debt, which includes $579 million of our variable rate short term debt, $100 million of variable rate senior notes and $161 million of variable rate gas facility revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point change in market interest rates from 5.56% to 6.56% would have resulted in an increase in pretax interest expense of $8 million on an annualized basis. To facilitate the achievement of desired fixed rate to variable rate debt ratios, AGL Capital entered into interest rate swaps whereby it agreed to exchange, fixed rate debt for floating rate debt. The swaps exchange at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable amounts calculated by reference to agreed on notional principal amounts. These swaps are designated to hedge the fair values of $100 million of the $300 million senior notes due in 2011. In August 2007, we executed a treasury lock agreement covering a notional amount totaling $125 million to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our $125 million senior notes offering in December 2007. The 10 year treasury interest rate was locked in at a weighted average rate of 4.5%. The treasury lock agreements settled and we paid $5 million in December 2007 in connection with our issuance of $125 million in senior notes. The $5 million is included within OCI (net of $2 million in income taxes) and will be amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes (through July 2016) as interest expense. 48 Table of Contents Credit Risk Distribution Operations Atlanta Gas Light has a concentration of credit risk as it bills only 12 Marketers in Georgia for its services. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies with the time of the year, with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in Georgia. These retail functions include customer service, billing, collections, and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Lights tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketers highest months estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2007, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, one of which was SouthStar, accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated operating margin and 52% of distribution operations operating margin. Several factors are designed to mitigate our risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. We accept credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities. The RMC reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each Marketer. We believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify, manage and report on Atlanta Gas Lights credit risk exposure to Marketers. Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. Retail Energy Operations SouthStar obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed SouthStars credit threshold. SouthStar considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on a review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, SouthStar also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties Moodys, S&P and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements. Wholesale Services Sequent has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Sequent also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Sequent is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Sequents credit risk. Sequent also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Master netting agreements enable Sequent to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Sequent also nets across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. Additionally, Sequent may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Sequent conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for its counterpartys line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have a minimum long term debt rating of Baa3 from Moodys and BBB from S&P. Generally, Sequent requires credit enhancements by way of guaranty, cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not meet the minimum ratings threshold. Sequent, which provides services to retail marketers and utility and industrial customers, also has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30 day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. As of December 31, 2007, Sequents top 20 counterparties represented approximately 53% of the total counterparty exposure of $366 million, derived by adding together the top 20 counterparties exposures and dividing by the total of Sequents counterparties exposures. 49 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, Sequents counterparties, or the counterparties guarantors, had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A , which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moodys ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moodys and 1 being D or Default by S&P and Moodys. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterpartys assigned internal rating is multiplied by the counterpartys credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. That sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to an S&P equivalent. The following table shows Sequents commodity receivable and payable positions as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, Gross receivables Gross payables In millions 2007 2006 2007 2006 Netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade $ 437 $ 359 $ 356 $ 297 Counterparty is non investment grade 24 62 18 52 Counterparty has no external rating 135 75 204 156 No netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade 3 9 5 Amount recorded on balance sheet $ 599 $ 505 $ 578 $ 510 Sequent has certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Sequent would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. Posting collateral would have a negative effect on our liquidity. If such collateral were not posted, Sequents ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired.
