ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the six states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders. With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas and general economic conditions that may impact our customers ability to pay for gas consumed. Various mechanisms exist that limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in all of our jurisdictions. Our retail energy operations segment, which consists of SouthStar, also is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to mitigate potential weather impacts. Our Sequent subsidiary within our wholesale services segment is temperature insensitive, but generally has greater opportunity to capture operating margin due to price volatility as a result of extreme weather. Our energy investments segments primary activity is our natural gas storage business, which develops, acquires and operates high deliverability salt dome storage assets in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. While this business also can generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, the majority of our storage services are covered under medium to long term contracts at a fixed market rate. Executive Summary Regulatory strategy We continue to actively pursue a regulatory strategy that reduces the lag between our investments in infrastructure and the recovery of those investments through various rate mechanisms. Our regulatory planning includes rate design proposals that should provide stabilized revenues through decoupling, or separating the recovery of fixed costs for providing service from the volumes of customer throughput. Our rate cases also include proposals for energy efficiency programs that should help customers lower the amount of gas used and conserve energy. Capital projects We continue to focus aggressively on capital discipline and cost control, while moving ahead with projects and initiatives that we expect to have current and future benefits and provide an appropriate return on invested capital. In 2009, our infrastructure improvement programs were approved in Georgia and New Jersey. Additionally, the Magnolia pipeline project, completed in November 2009, allowing access to Elba Island LNG, should enable us to meet future demand for and diversify our supply of natural gas for Atlanta Gas Light customers. Our Hampton Roads Crossing pipeline project, with portions placed in service in December 2009 and the remainder in January 2010, provides additional infrastructure to accommodate growth to the Virginia Natural Gas distribution system. In addition, our Golden Triangle Storage project in Beaumont, Texas is on schedule and we expect the first cavern to be in operation in the second half of 2010. Customer growth We continue to see challenging economic conditions in all of the areas we serve and, as a result, have experienced lower than expected customer growth in our distribution operations and retail energy operations segments throughout 2009, a trend we expect to continue through 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our distribution operations customer growth rate was (0.3)%, compared to 0.1% for 2008. The lower levels of customer growth are primarily a result of much slower growth in the residential housing markets throughout our service territories. This trend has been offset slightly by growth in the commercial customer segment in certain areas, primarily as a result of conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources as well as new product and service offerings. We continue to use a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing ones. These programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. We also use analytical predictive models to identify and target customers who might consider switching from natural gas to other sources of energy in order to retain them as a customer. We have seen a 4% decline in average customer count in Georgia at SouthStar for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008. This decline reflects some of the same economic conditions that have affected our utility businesses, as well as a more competitive retail market for natural gas in Georgia. Glossary of Key Terms 22 Table of Contents Natural gas price volatility Natural gas commodity prices have a significant impact on our customer rates and on our long term competitive position against other energy sources. Over the last two years, daily Henry Hub spot market prices for natural gas in the United States has been extremely volatile and ranged between a high of $13.58 per Mcf in July 2008 to a low of $2.51 per Mcf in September 2009. Our natural gas acquisition strategy is designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility customers and to hedge gas prices to effectively manage costs, reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage. Although spot natural gas prices were as low as $2.51 per Mcf during 2009, the current forward price of natural gas continues to remain at much higher levels from $5.12 to $6.47 per Mcf over the next year. Our hedging strategies and physical natural gas supplies in storage enable us to reduce earnings risk exposure due to higher gas costs. Capital market plan Our capital market plan over the next 12 to 18 months includes maintaining our total debt to total capitalization targets between 50% and 60%, the renewal of our $1 billion Credit Facility, the renewal of the letter of credit agreements which provide credit support for our variable rate gas facility revenue bonds and refinancing of $300 million in 7.125% senior notes set to mature in January 2011. We cannot predict whether renewing our Credit Facility or refinancing the senior notes would result in favorable terms or interest rates. Additionally, due to the significant changes in the credit markets, we expect that the costs of a renewed credit facility would increase and the duration to be less than the 5 year term under our existing Credit Facility. We have not yet determined whether we will seek to increase or decrease the size of the Credit Facility from its current $1 billion level. Hedges Changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of our operations to earnings variability. Our nonutility businesses principally use physical and financial arrangements to reduce the risks associated with both weather related seasonal fluctuations in market conditions and changing commodity prices. These economic hedges may not qualify, or are not designated for, hedge accounting treatment. As a result, our reported earnings for the wholesale services and retail energy operations segments reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating revenues or our OCI for those derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as accounting hedges. The net losses on weather hedges during 2009 at retail energy operations were more than offset by corresponding increases in operating margin due to colder weather the hedges were designed to protect against. Elizabethtown Gas utilizes certain financial derivatives in accordance with a directive from the New Jersey BPU to create a hedging program to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices. These derivative products are accounted for at fair value each reporting period. In accordance with regulatory requirements, realized gains and losses related to these financial derivatives are reflected in deferred natural gas costs and ultimately included in billings to customers. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability, as appropriate, in our consolidated statements of financial position. Seasonality The operating revenues and EBIT of our distribution operations, retail energy operations and wholesale services segments are seasonal. During the heating season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher because more customers are connected to our distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather than in periods of warmer weather. Occasionally in the summer, Sequents operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain statements of financial position items such as receivables, unbilled revenue, inventories and short term debt across quarters. However, these items are comparable when reviewing our annual results. Approximately 70% of these segments operating revenues and 79% of these segments EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2009 were generated during the first and fourth quarters of 2009, and are reflected in our consolidated statements of income for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2009. Our base operating expenses, excluding cost of gas, interest expense and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, our operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. Results of Operations We generate nearly all our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. We include in our consolidated revenues an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed, to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. No individual customer or industry accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. The following table provides more information regarding the components of our operating revenues. Glossary of Key Terms 23 Table of Contents In millions 2009 2008 2007 Residential $ 1,091 $ 1,194 $ 1,143 Commercial 467 598 500 Transportation 378 459 401 Industrial 185 322 250 Other 196 227 200 Total operating revenues $ 2,317 $ 2,800 $ 2,494 We evaluate segment performance using the measures of operating margin and EBIT, which include the effects of corporate expense allocations. Our operating margin and EBIT are not measures that are considered to be calculated in accordance with GAAP. Operating margin is a non GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues minus cost of gas, which excludes operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and the gain or loss on the sale of our assets; these items are included in our calculation of operating income as reflected in our consolidated statements of income. EBIT is also a non GAAP measure that includes operating income, other income and expenses. Items that we do not include in EBIT are financing costs, including interest and debt expense and income taxes, each of which we evaluate on a consolidated level. We believe operating margin is a better indicator than operating revenues for the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of gas can vary significantly and is generally billed directly to our customers. We also consider operating margin to be a better indicator in our retail energy operations, wholesale services and energy investments segments since it is a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs. We believe EBIT is a useful measurement of our operating segments performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective, exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes, neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations. You should not consider operating margin or EBIT an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, our operating performance than operating income or net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and EBIT measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of operating margin to operating income and EBIT to earnings before income taxes and net income, together with other consolidated financial information for the last three years. In millions 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 2,317 $ 2,800 $ 2,494 Cost of gas 1,142 1,654 1,369 Operating margin 1,175 1,146 1,125 Operating expenses 699 668 636 Operating income 476 478 489 Other income 9 6 4 EBIT 485 484 493 Interest expense 101 115 125 Earnings before income taxes 384 369 368 Income tax expense 135 132 127 Net income 249 237 241 Less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 27 20 30 Net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. $ 222 $ 217 $ 211 Over the last three years, on average, we have derived 67% of our operating segments EBIT from our regulated natural gas distribution business whose rates are approved by state regulatory commissions. We derived our remaining operating segments EBIT for the last three years principally from businesses that are complementary to our natural gas distribution business. These businesses include the sale of natural gas to retail customers, natural gas asset management and the operation of high deliverability natural gas underground storage as ancillary activities to our regulated utility franchises. Glossary of Key Terms 24 Table of Contents The following chart provides each operating segments percentage contribution to the total EBIT for our operating segments for the last three years. In 2009 our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. increased by $5 million from the prior year primarily due to decreased interest expense and increased EBIT from retail energy operations largely due to higher operating margin. This was partly offset by decreased EBIT at distribution operations, wholesale services and energy investments. The decrease in EBIT at distribution operations was primarily due to increased operating expenses offset by increased operating margin. The decrease in EBIT at wholesale services and energy investments was the result of decreased operating margins and increased operating expenses. In 2008 our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. increased by $6 million from the prior year primarily due to decreased interest expenses and increased EBIT from wholesale services and energy investments largely due to higher operating margin offset by higher operating expenses. This was offset by decreased EBIT at distribution operations and retail energy operations due to lower operating margins at both operating segments and higher operating expenses at distribution operations. Interest expense Our decreased interest expense over the last two years was primarily due to lower short term interest rates partially offset by higher average debt. The following table provides additional detail on interest expense for the last three years and the primary items that affect year over year change. In millions 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 101 $ 115 $ 125 Average debt outstanding (1) $ 2,239 $ 2,156 $ 1,967 Average rate (2) 4.5 % 5.3 % 6.4 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. (2) Excluding $3 million premium paid for early redemption of debt, average rate in 2007 would have been 6.2%. The difficult economic conditions of the current recession have resulted in low U.S. Treasury yields and corresponding indexes on short term borrowings. These factors have favorably impacted our earnings in 2009 and 2008 through reduced short term rates that we paid on our commercial paper borrowings. For more information on the impact that interest rate fluctuations have on our variable rate debt, see Interest Rate Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Income tax expense Our income tax expense in 2009 increased by $3 million or 2% compared to 2008, and increased by $5 million or 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were primarily due to higher consolidated earnings. Our effective tax rate was 37.8% in 2009 and 2008 and was 37.6% in 2007. As a result of our adoption of new authoritative guidance related to consolidations, income tax expense and our effective tax rate are determined from earnings before income taxes less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest. For more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective rate, see Note 8. Operating metrics Selected weather, customer and volume metrics for 2009, 2008 and 2007, which we consider to be some of the key performance indicators for our operating segments, are presented in the following tables. We measure the effects of weather on our business through heating degree days. Generally, increased heating degree days result in greater demand for gas on our distribution systems. However, extended and unusually mild weather during the heating season can have a significant negative impact on demand for natural gas. Our customer metrics highlight the average number of customers to which we provide services. This number of customers can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions and competition from alternative fuels. Volume metrics for distribution operations and retail energy operations present the effects of weather and our customers demand for natural gas. Wholesale services daily physical sales represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.

Our capital market strategy has continued to focus on maintaining a strong consolidated statement of financial position; ensuring ample cash resources and daily liquidity; accessing capital markets at favorable times as needed; managing critical business risks; and maintaining a balanced capital structure through the appropriate issuance of equity or long term debt securities. Our issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval, or review by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions, the SEC and the FERC. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation. We believe the amounts available to us under our Credit Facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities together with cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, pension contributions, construction expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments, common share repurchases and other cash needs through the next several years. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements. The following table provides a summary of our operating, investing and financing activities for the last three years. In millions 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 592 $ 227 $ 377 Investing activities (476 ) (372 ) (253 ) Financing activities (106 ) 142 (122 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 10 $ (3 ) $ 2 Cash Flow from Operating Activities We prepare our statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes and changes in the consolidated statements of financial position for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. Glossary of Key Terms 28 Table of Contents Our operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the first and fourth quarters of each year. As a result of this seasonality, our natural gas inventories are usually at their highest levels in November each year, and largely are drawn down in the heating season, providing a source of cash as this asset is used to satisfy winter sales demand. The injections in and price fluctuations of our natural gas inventories, which meet customer demand during the winter heating season, can cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations from period to period and are reflected in changes to our working capital. Year over year changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our distribution operations, retail energy operations and wholesale services segments resulting from the impact of weather, the price of natural gas, the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries as our business has grown and prices for natural gas have increased. The increase or decrease in the price of natural gas directly impacts the cost of gas stored in inventory. 2009 compared to 2008 In 2009, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $592 million, an increase of $365 million or 161% from 2008. The primary contributor to the recovery of working capital during 2009 was significantly lower natural gas commodity prices as compared to 2008. During 2008, the cost of natural gas increased significantly during the natural gas storage injection season. This resulted in a higher cost of inventories in 2008 as compared to 2009, and consequently higher customer bills and accounts receivable at the end of 2008. The higher receivable balances and inventory costs were billed to and /or collected from customers during 2009, which resulted in a $173 million increase in cash from the collection of our natural gas receivables and a $103 million increase in cash from our inventory withdrawals. As a result of the lower natural gas prices during 2009, we used less cash as we refilled our natural gas inventories. The lower natural gas prices and associated inventory costs reduced customer bills at the end of 2009, allowing us to reduce our working capital needs. Also contributing to the higher operating cash flows was the return of cash collateral requirements posted during 2008 due to unrealized hedge losses resulting from the dramatic decline in natural gas prices during the second half of 2008 and into 2009. Cash collateral requirements decreased $200 million for our derivative financial instrument activities at Sequent and SouthStar due to the change in hedge values as forward NYMEX curve prices shifted downward in 2009. 2008 compared to 2007 In 2008, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $227 million, a decrease of $150 million or 40% from 2007. This decrease was primarily a result of increased working capital requirements of $104 million, principally driven by increased cash used for inventory purchases which were impacted by rising natural gas prices during the first half of 2008. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of PP&E expenditures. The majority of our PP&E expenditures are within our distribution operations segment, which includes our investments in new construction and infrastructure improvements. Our estimated PP&E expenditures in 2010 and actual PP&E expenditures in 2009, 2008 and 2007 are shown within the following categories and are presented in the table below.

This was primarily due to $43 million expended for the completed Magnolia project, $45 million in increased spending for the completed Hampton Roads pipeline project and an increase in our natural gas storage project expenditures of $31 million as we continued construction of our Golden Triangle Storage facility. This was largely offset by decreased expenditures of $22 million for the other category, primarily on information technology and building and leasehold improvements. In 2008, our PP&E expenditures were $113 million or 44% higher than in 2007. This was primarily due to an increase in our natural gas storage project expenditures of $48 million as we began construction of our Golden Triangle Storage facility, $43 million in increased expenditures for the Hampton Roads project and increased expenditures of $29 million for the pipeline replacement program at Atlanta Gas Light as we replaced larger diameter pipe in more densely populated areas. This was offset by decreased expenditures of $7 million on our base business and other projects. Our estimated expenditures for 2010 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the base business, natural gas storage and other categories. We continually evaluate whether to proceed with these projects, reviewing them in relation to factors including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. We will make adjustments to these discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of equity and debt securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, appropriate mix of debt with fixed to floating interest rates (our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt), as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities. As of December 31, 2009, our variable rate debt was $762 million or 30% of our total debt, compared to $1,026 million or 40% as of December 31, 2008. This decrease was principally due to lower natural gas prices during the 2009 inventory injection season and thus requiring lower working capital needs, as well as our issuance of $300 million in senior notes in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, our Credit Facility and commercial paper borrowings were $601 million or 22% lower than the same time last year, primarily a result of higher working capital requirements in 2008, driven by higher natural gas prices during the 2008 inventory injection season. For more information on our debt, see Note 6. Our cash flows from financing activities reflect a net use of cash of $106 million in 2009 as compared to a net source of cash of $142 million in 2008. This change primarily reflects the repayment in 2009 of short term debt outstanding at the end of 2008 coupled with our net borrowing last year to meet working capital needs due to higher natural gas prices. Credit Ratings We strive to maintain or improve our credit ratings on our debt to manage our existing financing cost and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms. Factors we consider important in assessing our credit ratings include our statements of financial position leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2009. S&P Moodys Fitch Corporate rating A Commercial paper A 2 P 2 F2 Senior unsecured BBB+ Baa1 A Ratings outlook Stable Stable Stable A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for S&P is AAA, Moodys is Aaa and Fitch is AAA. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If the rating agencies downgrade our ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease. Default Events Our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. Our most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, and acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Glossary of Key Terms 30 Table of Contents Our Credit Facility has financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70%; however, our goal is to maintain this ratio at levels between 50% and 60%. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization calculation contained in our debt covenant includes standby letters of credit, surety bonds and the exclusion of other comprehensive income pension adjustments. Our debt to equity calculation, as defined by our Credit Facility, was 57% at December 31, 2009 and 59% at December 31, 2008. These amounts are within our required and targeted ranges. The components of our capital structure, as calculated from our consolidated statements of financial position, as of the dates indicated, are provided in the following table. In millions December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Short term debt $ 602 14 % $ 866 20 % Long term debt 1,974 45 1,675 40 Total debt 2,576 59 2,541 60 Equity 1,819 41 1,684 40 Total capitalization $ 4,395 100 % $ 4,225 100 % We currently comply with all existing debt provisions and covenants. We believe that accomplishing our capitalization objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and to allow us access to capital at reasonable costs. Short term Debt Our short term debt is composed of borrowings and payments under our Credit Facility and commercial paper program, lines of credit and payments of the current portion of our capital leases. Our short term debt financing generally increases between June and December because our payments for natural gas and pipeline capacity are generally made to suppliers prior to the collection of accounts receivable from our customers. We typically reduce short term debt balances in the spring because a significant portion of our current assets are converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by our $1 billion Credit Facility, which expires in August 2011. Our supplemental $140 million Credit Facility expired in September 2009. We have the option to request an increase in the aggregate principal amount available for borrowing under the $1 billion Credit Facility to $1.25 billion on not more than three occasions during each calendar year. We expect to begin the process of renewing our Credit Facility during 2010. Because of the current conditions in the credit markets, we are anticipating that the costs of a renewed Credit Facility will be significantly higher and that the term could be significantly shorter than the 5 year term of the current facility. These market conditions could also result in the need for us to increase the number of financial institution participants to provide a similar amount of financial commitments as our existing Credit Facility. As part of our renewal process we will consider whether the facility should increase or decrease from its current capacity of $1 billion. SouthStar has a $75 million line of credit which is used for its working capital and general corporate needs. Additionally, Sequent has a $5 million line of credit that bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) rate plus 3.0%. Sequents line of credit is used solely for the posting of margin deposits for NYMEX transactions and is unconditionally guaranteed by us. The lenders under our Credit Facility and lines of credit are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2009 as indicated in the following table. Investment grade, in the context of bond ratings, is the rating level above which institutional investors are authorized to invest (a bond judged likely enough to meet payment obligations that banks and pensions are allowed to invest in it). Lender rating (S&P / Moodys) Amount committed (in millions) % of total AAA / Aaa $ AA / Aa 328 31 % A / A 582 54 % BBB / Baa 165 15 % Total $ 1,075 100 % Based on current credit market conditions, it is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency. However, based on our current assessment of our lenders creditworthiness, we believe the risk of lender default is minimal. As of December 31, 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, we had $500 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our working capital needs. However, during the third and fourth quarters of 2008, adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets made it more difficult for us to access the commercial paper market at reasonable rates. As a result, at times we relied instead upon our Credit Facility for our liquidity and capital resource needs. The credit markets improved in 2009, allowing us to resume our commercial paper borrowings. Glossary of Key Terms 31 Table of Contents Increasing natural gas commodity prices can have a significant impact on our liquidity and working capital requirements. Based on current natural gas prices and our expected purchases during the upcoming injection season, a $1 increase per Mcf in natural gas prices could result in an additional $50 to $70 million of working capital requirements during the peak of the heating season based upon our current injection plan. This range is sensitive to the timing of storage injections and withdrawals, collateral requirements and our portfolio position. Long term Debt Our long term debt matures more than one year from the statements of financial position date and consists of medium term notes, senior notes, gas facility revenue bonds, and capital leases. The following represents our long term debt activity over the last three years. Gas Facility Revenue Bonds In June 2008, we refinanced $122 million of our gas facility revenue bonds, $47 million due October 2022, $20 million due October 2024 and $55 million due June 2032. There was no change to the maturity dates of these bonds. The $55 million bond had an interest rate that resets daily and the $47 million and $20 million bonds had a 35 day auction period where the interest rate adjusted every 35 days. Both the bonds with principal amounts of $47 million and $55 million now have interest rates that reset daily and the bond with a principal amount of $20 million has an interest rate that resets weekly. The interest rates at December 31, 2009, ranged from 0.2% to 0.4%. In September 2008, we refinanced $39 million of our gas facility revenue bonds due June 2026. The bonds had a 35 day auction period where the interest rate adjusted every 35 days now they have interest rates that reset daily. The maturity date of these bonds remains June 2026. The interest rate at December 31, 2009, was 0.2%. Senior notes In December 2007, AGL Capital issued $125 million of 6.375% senior notes. The proceeds of the note issuances, equal to approximately $123 million, were used to pay down short term indebtedness incurred under our commercial paper program. In August 2009, AGL Capital issued $300 million of 10 year senior notes at an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $297 million. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay a portion of our short term debt. Notes payable to Trusts In July 2007, we used the proceeds from the sale of commercial paper to pay AGL Capital Trust I the $75 million principal amount of 8.17% junior subordinated debentures plus a $3 million premium for early redemption of the junior subordinated debentures, and to pay a $2 million note representing our common securities interest in AGL Capital Trust I. Medium term notes In January 2007, we used proceeds from the sale of commercial paper to redeem $11 million of 7% medium term notes previously scheduled to mature in January 2015. Noncontrolling Interest A cash distribution for SouthStars dividend distributions to Piedmont of $20 million in 2009, $30 million in 2008 and $23 million in 2007 was recorded in our consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity. Dividends on Common Stock Our common stock dividend payments were $127 million in 2009, $124 million in 2008, and $123 million in 2007. The increases were generally the result of annual dividend increases of $0.04 per share for each of the last two years. Our average dividend yield over the last three years was 4.8%, which is slightly higher than the average 4.0% dividend yield of our peer companies. Our dividend payout ratio was 60% in 2009, 59% in 2008 and 54% in 2007. We expect that our dividend payout ratio will remain consistent with the dividend payout ratios of our peer companies, which is currently an average of 63%. For information about restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Methods of Application. Treasury Shares In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to purchase up to 8 million shares of our outstanding common stock over a five year period. These purchases are intended principally to offset share issuances under our employee and non employee director incentive compensation plans and our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases under this program may be made in the open market or in private transactions at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of common shares that we will purchase, and we can terminate or limit the program at any time. Glossary of Key Terms 32 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not purchase shares of our common stock. During the same period in 2007, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost of $39.56 per common share and an aggregate cost of $80 million. We currently anticipate holding the purchased shares as treasury shares. For more information on our common share repurchases see Item 5 Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Shelf Registration In August 2007, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC, which expires in August 2010. The debt securities and related guarantees will be issued by AGL Capital under an indenture dated as of February 20, 2001, as supplemented and modified, as necessary, among AGL Capital, AGL Resources and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The indenture provides for the issuance from time to time of debt securities in an unlimited dollar amount and an unlimited number of series, subject to our Credit Facility financial covenants related to total debt to total capitalization. The debt securities will be guaranteed by AGL Resources. In 2010, we expect to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC that would expire in 2013. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. As we do for other subsidiaries, AGL Resources provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for SouthStar in support of payment obligations. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligation payments such as debt and lease agreements, and commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2009. 2011 & 2013 & 2015 & In millions Total 2010 2012 2014 thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,974 $ $ 318 $ 225 $ 1,431 Short term debt 602 602 Pipeline replacement program costs (1) 210 55 111 44 Environmental remediation liabilities (1) 144 25 54 38 27 Total $ 2,930 $ 682 $ 483 $ 307 $ 1,458 Unrecorded contractual obligations and commitments (2): Pipeline charges, storage capacity and gas supply (3) $ 2,049 $ 510 $ 712 $ 354 $ 473 Interest charges (4) 1,014 109 176 156 573 Operating leases 115 28 40 14 33 Asset management agreements (5) 37 23 14 Pension contributions 21 21 Standby letters of credit, performance / surety bonds 19 18 1 Total $ 3,255 $ 709 $ 943 $ 524 $ 1,079 (1) Includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms. (2) In accordance with GAAP, these items are not reflected in our consolidated statements of financial position. (3) Charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism or alternatively billed to Marketers, and includes demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply amount includes SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 16 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2009, and is valued at $97 million. (4) Floating rate debt is based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2009, and the maturity of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2009, we have $41 million of accrued interest on our consolidated statements of financial position that will be paid in 2010. (5) Represent fixed fee minimum payments for Sequents asset management agreements. Glossary of Key Terms 33 Table of Contents Operating leases. We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to leases. However, this accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flow from operating and financing activities. Standby letters of credit and performance / surety bonds. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows. Pension and Postretirement Obligations. Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Pension Protection Act. Additionally, we calculate any required pension contributions using the projected unit credit cost method. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. The state regulatory commissions have phase ins that defer a portion of the postretirement benefit expense for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $10 million as of December 31, 2009 and $11 million as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we recorded a regulatory liability of $5 million as of December 31, 2009 and $5 million as of December 31, 2008 for our expected expenses under the AGL Postretirement Plan. See Note 3 Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information about our pension and postretirement plans. In 2009, we contributed $24 million to our qualified pension plans. In 2008, we did not make a contribution, as one was not required. Based on the current funding status of the plans, we would be required to make a minimum contribution to the plans of approximately $21 million in 2010. We are planning to make additional contributions in 2010 up to $17 million, for a total of up to $38 million, in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from our estimates. Each of the following critical accounting estimates involves complex situations requiring a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. Pipeline Replacement Program Liabilities Atlanta Gas Light was ordered by the Georgia Commission (through a joint stipulation and a subsequent settlement agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia Commission staff) to undertake a pipeline replacement program that would replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system. Approximately 31 miles of cast iron and 303 miles of bare steel pipe still require replacement. If Atlanta Gas Light does not perform in accordance with the initial and amended pipeline replacement program stipulation, it can be assessed certain nonperformance penalties. However to date, Atlanta Gas Light is in full compliance. The stipulation also provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred under the program, which Atlanta Gas Light has recorded as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset has two components: the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders The determination of future expected costs associated with our pipeline replacement program involves judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the future expected costs are projected capital expenditure spending, including labor and material costs, and the remaining infrastructure footage to be replaced for the remaining years of the program. We recorded a long term liability of $155 million as of December 31, 2009 and $140 million as of December 31, 2008, which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the pipeline replacement program. As of December 31, 2009, we had recorded a current liability of $55 million, representing expected pipeline replacement program expenditures for the next 12 months. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. If Atlanta Gas Lights pipeline replacement program expenditures, subject to future recovery, were $10 million higher or lower its incremental expected annual revenues would have changed by approximately $1 million. Glossary of Key Terms 34 Table of Contents Environmental Remediation Liabilities We historically reported estimates of future remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. As we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter into cleanup contracts, we are increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of the remediation program. These estimates contain various engineering uncertainties, and we continuously attempt to refine and update these engineering estimates. The following table provides more information on our former operating sites: In millions Cost estimate range Amount recorded Expected costs over next twelve months Georgia and Florida $ 64 $113 $ 64 $ 13 New Jersey 69 134 69 11 North Carolina 11 16 11 1 Total $ 144 $263 $ 144 $ 25 We have confirmed 13 former operating sites in Georgia and Florida where Atlanta Gas Light owned or operated all or part of these sites. One additional former MGP site has been recently identified adjacent to an existing MGP remediation site. Precise engineering soil and groundwater clean up estimates are not available and considerable variability exists with this potential new site. As of December 31, 2009, the soil and sediment remediation program was substantially complete for all Georgia sites, except for a few remaining areas of recently discovered impact, although groundwater cleanup continues. Investigation is concluded for one phase of the Orlando, Florida site; however, the Environmental Protection Agency has not approved the clean up plans. For elements of the Georgia and Florida sites where we still cannot provide engineering cost estimates, considerable variability remains in future cost estimates. Additionally, we have identified six former operating sites in New Jersey where Elizabethtown Gas owned or operated all or part of these sites. Material cleanups of these sites have not been completed nor are precise estimates available for future cleanup costs and therefore considerable variability remains in future cost estimates. We have also identified a site in North Carolina, which is subject to a remediation order by the North Carolina Department of Energy and Natural Resources. There are no cost recovery mechanisms for the environmental remediation of this site. Atlanta Gas Lights environmental remediation liability is included in its corresponding regulatory asset. Atlanta Gas Lights estimate does not include other potential expenses, such as unasserted property damage, personal injury or natural resource damage claims, unbudgeted legal expenses, or other costs for which it may be held liable but with respect to which the amount cannot be reasonably forecast. Atlanta Gas Lights recovery of environmental remediation costs is subject to review by the Georgia Commission, which may seek to disallow the recovery of some expenses. In New Jersey, Elizabethtown Gas is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The New Jersey BPU has authorized Elizabethtown Gas to recover prudently incurred remediation costs for the New Jersey properties through its remediation adjustment clause. Elizabethtown Gas has been successful in recovering a portion of remediation costs incurred in New Jersey from its insurance carriers and continues to pursue additional recovery. As of December 31, 2009, the variation between the amounts of the environmental remediation cost liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position and the associated regulatory asset is due to expenditures for environmental investigation and remediation exceeding recoveries from ratepayers and insurance carriers. We also own remediation sites located outside of New Jersey. One site, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, is subject to an order by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. There is one other site in North Carolina where investigation and remediation is possible, although no regulatory order exists and we do not believe costs associated with this site can be reasonably estimated. With respect to these costs, we currently pursue or intend to pursue recovery from ratepayers (except for the Elizabeth City, North Carolina site), former owners and operators and insurance carriers. While we have been successful in recovering a portion of these remediation costs from our insurance carriers, we are not able to express a belief as to the success of additional recovery efforts. We are working with the regulatory agencies to manage our remediation costs so as to mitigate the impact of such costs on both ratepayers and shareholders. Glossary of Key Terms 35 Table of Contents Derivatives and Hedging Activities The authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging established accounting and reporting standards which require that every derivative financial instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the statements of financial position as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for and is designated as a normal purchase and sale, it is exempted from the fair value accounting treatment of this guidance, and is accounted for using traditional accrual accounting. The guidance requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, the guidance allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, the guidance requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. The guidance applies to gas commodity contracts executed by Sequent and SouthStar. The guidance also applies to gas commodity contracts executed by Elizabethtown Gas under a New Jersey BPU authorized hedging program that requires gains and losses on these derivatives are reflected in purchased gas costs and ultimately billed to customers. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 2 and Item 1 Business. Commodity related Derivative Instruments We are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. Through Sequent and SouthStar, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas. Sequent recognizes the change in value of a derivative financial instrument as an unrealized gain or loss in revenues in the period when the market value of the instrument changes. Sequent recognizes cash inflows and outflows associated with the settlement of its risk management activities in operating cash flows, and reports these settlements as receivables and payables in the statements of financial position separately from the risk management activities reported as energy marketing receivables and trade payables. We attempt to mitigate substantially all of our commodity price risk associated with Sequents natural gas storage portfolio and lock in the economic margin at the time we enter into purchase transactions for our stored natural gas. We purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price we pay plus storage costs is less than the market price we could receive in the future. We lock in the economic margin by selling NYMEX futures contracts or other OTC derivatives in the forward months corresponding with our withdrawal periods. We use contracts to sell natural gas at that future price to lock in the operating revenues we will ultimately realize when the stored natural gas is actually sold. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging. The purchase, storage and sale of natural gas are accounted for differently from the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio. That difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported operating margin, even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date we entered into the transactions. We do not currently use hedge accounting under the authoritative guidance to account for this activity. Natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Under current accounting guidance, we recognize a loss in any period when the market price for natural gas is lower than the carrying amount of our purchased natural gas inventory. Costs to store the natural gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred. We recognize revenues and cost of natural gas sold in our statement of consolidated income in the period we sell gas and it is delivered out of the storage facility. The derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the operating margin upon the sale of stored natural gas are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change. This difference in accounting the lower of weighted average cost or market basis for our storage inventory versus the fair value accounting for the derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk can and does result in volatility in our reported earnings. Over time, gains or losses on the sale of storage inventory will be substantially offset by losses or gains on the derivatives, resulting in realization of the economic profit margin we expected when we entered into the transactions. This accounting difference causes Sequents earnings on its storage positions to be affected by natural gas price changes, even though the economic profits remain essentially unchanged. Glossary of Key Terms 36 Table of Contents SouthStar also uses derivative instruments to manage exposures arising from changing commodity prices. SouthStars objective for holding these derivatives is to minimize volatility in wholesale commodity natural gas prices. A portion of SouthStars derivative transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging. Derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and are reclassified into earnings in the same period the underlying hedged item is reflected in the income statement. As of December 31, 2009, the ending balance in OCI for derivative transactions designated as cash flow hedges under the guidance was a loss of $4 million, net of noncontrolling interest and taxes. Any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset the losses or gains on the hedged item, is recorded into earnings in the period in which it occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. SouthStars remaining derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under the guidance. Therefore, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the period of change. SouthStar also enters into weather derivative instruments in order to stabilize operating margins in the event of warmer than normal and colder than normal weather in the winter months. These contracts are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the authoritative guidance related to financial instruments. Changes in the intrinsic value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings in the period of change. The weather derivative contracts contain strike amount provisions based on cumulative heating degree days for the covered periods. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, SouthStar entered into weather derivatives (swaps and options) for the respective winter heating seasons, primarily from November through March. As of December 31, 2009, SouthStar recorded a current asset of $2 million for this hedging activity. Contingencies Our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities, including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, rate matters, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance related to contingencies. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates can be, and often are, revised either negatively or positively, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. We annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the expected return on assets, the assumed health care cost trend rate and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate. With the assistance of our actuaries, we consider certain market indices, including Moodys Corporate AA long term bond rate, the Citigroup Pension Liability rate, other high grade bond indices and a single equivalent discount rate derived utilizing the forecasted future cash flows in each year to the appropriate spot rates based on high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds. The expected long term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that years annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs. Glossary of Key Terms 37 Table of Contents During 2009, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $12 million related to our defined pension and postretirement benefit costs. We estimate that in 2010, we will record net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the range of $15 million to $17 million, a $3 million to $5 million increase compared to 2009. In determining our estimated expenses for 2010, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.75% expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 6% for the AGL Retirement Plan and 5.75% for the NUI Retirement Plan and for our postretirement plan. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal and retirement rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension and postretirement expense recorded in future periods. The following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions for our pension and postretirement plans, as discussed previously, while holding all other assumptions constant. In millions Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in ABO Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1 % $ / $ (4) / 4 Discount rate +/ 1 % (58) / 64 (5) / 5 Effective on July 1, 2009, all post 65 health coverage except for the retiree health care reimbursement account and opt out benefits was eliminated. There were no changes to the life insurance plan. Effective January 1, 2010, enhancements were made to the pre 65 medical coverage by removing the current cap on the expected costs and implementation of a new cap determined by the new retiree premium schedule based on salary level and years of service. Consequently, a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate does not materially affect the periodic benefit cost or our accumulated projected benefit obligation for our postretirement plans. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon an annual review of participant census information as of the measurement date. At December 31, 2009, our pension and postretirement liability decreased by approximately $48 million, primarily resulting from an after tax gain to OCI of $17 million ($28 million before tax), 2009 contributions of $24 million and $8 million in benefit payments that we funded offset by $12 million in net pension and postretirement benefit costs we recorded in 2009. These changes reflect our funding contributions to the plan, benefit payments out of the plans, and updated valuations for the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and plan assets. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported unfunded PBO and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, as the primary factors that drive the value of our unfunded accumulated benefit obligation are the assumed discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. Additionally, for our largest pension plan equity market performance has a significant effect on our market related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five year moving weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the MRVPA. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. See Note 3, Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information on our pension and postretirement plans, which includes our investment policies and strategies, target allocation ranges and weighted average asset allocations for 2009 and 2008. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance related to income taxes which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, we did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As a result of our adoption of new authoritative guidance related to consolidations, income tax expense and our effective tax rate are determined from earnings before income tax less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest. For more information on our adoption of this guidance, see Note 5. Glossary of Key Terms 38 Table of Contents Our net long term deferred tax liability totaled $695 million at December 31, 2009 (see Note 8 Income Taxes). This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our income tax returns. For state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had a $3 million valuation allowance on $79 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. Accounting Developments Variable Interest Entity In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, which amended the guidance related to transfers and servicing. This guidance requires improved disclosures about transfers of financial assets and removes the exception from applying the guidance related to consolidations specifically for variable interest entities (VIE) to qualifying special purpose entities. This amendment will be effective for us on January 1, 2010 and it will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In June 2009, the FASB issued additional consolidation guidance for VIE. This authoritative guidance requires us to assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether we have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE. In addition, the guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2010 and it will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our VIE is described in further detail in Note 5. Glossary of Key Terms 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to risks associated with natural gas prices, interest rates and credit. Natural gas price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of natural gas. Interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations and in wholesale services. Our Risk Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with, and adherence to, the terms within these policies, including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels. Our RMC consists of members of senior management who monitor open natural gas price risk positions and other types of risk, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities. It is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the RMC to perform its monitoring functions. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatments are described in further detail in Note 2. Natural Gas Price Risk Retail Energy Operations SouthStars use of derivative instruments is governed by a risk management policy, approved and monitored by its Finance and Risk Management Committee, which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities SouthStar routinely utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain natural gas price and weather risk inherent in the natural gas industry. This includes the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. SouthStar uses these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins. We have designated a portion of SouthStars derivative transactions as cash flow hedges in accordance with authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging. We record derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassify them into earnings as cost of gas in our consolidated statement of income in the same period as the underlying hedged transaction occurs and is recorded in earnings. We record any hedge ineffectiveness, defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset and are greater than the losses or gains on the hedged item, in cost of gas in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. SouthStar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness. We have not designated the remainder of SouthStars derivative instruments as hedges under the guidance and, accordingly, we record changes in their fair value in earnings as cost of gas in our consolidated statements of income in the period of change. SouthStar recorded a net unrealized gain related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized in its energy marketing and risk management activities of $20 million during 2009, unrealized losses of $27 million during 2008 and $7 million during 2007. The following tables illustrate the change in the net fair value of the derivative financial instruments during 2009, 2008 and 2007 and provide details of the net fair value of derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

A 95% confidence interval means that over the holding period, an actual loss in portfolio value is not expected to exceed the calculated VaR more than 5% of the time. We calculate VaR based on the variance covariance technique. This technique requires several assumptions for the basis of the calculation, such as price distribution, price volatility, confidence interval and holding period. Our VaR may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because, although VaR is a common metric in the energy industry, there is no established industry standard for calculating VaR or for the assumptions underlying such calculations. SouthStars portfolio of positions for 2009, 2008 and 2007, had annual average 1 day holding period VaRs of less than $100,000, and its high, low and period end 1 day holding period VaR were immaterial. Wholesale Services Sequent routinely uses various types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain natural gas price risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and financial swap agreements. Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities We account for derivative transactions in connection with Sequents energy marketing activities on a fair value basis in accordance with authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging. We record derivative energy commodity contracts (including both physical transactions and financial instruments) at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value reflected in our earnings in the period of change. Sequents energy trading contracts are recorded on an accrual basis and its derivatives are recorded at fair value under authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging. Sequent experienced a $36 million increase in the net fair value of its outstanding contracts during 2009 and $25 million during 2008 and a $62 million decrease in the net fair value of its outstanding contracts during 2007, due to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments utilized in its energy marketing and risk management activities and contract settlements and new business contracts acquired in 2009. The following tables illustrate the change in the net fair value of Sequents derivative financial instruments during 2009, 2008 and 2007 and provide details of the net fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Because Sequent generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures markets, its open exposure is generally immaterial, permitting Sequent to operate within relatively low VaR limits. Sequent employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risks of its open positions. Sequents management actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR. Sequent continues to maintain a relatively matched book, where its total buy volume is close to its sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a 1 day holding period for all positions, Sequents portfolio of positions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 had the following VaRs.

As of December 31, 2009, Golden Triangle Storage had locked in the price of approximately 68% of the required pad gas for the first storage cavern or 2 Bcf and the associated fair value of the derivative financial instruments was immaterial. Glossary of Key Terms 42 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows. Our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on $762 million of variable rate debt, which includes $601 million of our variable rate short term debt and $161 million of variable rate gas facility revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2009, a 100 basis point change in market interest rates from 0.4% to 1.4% would have resulted in an increase in pretax interest expense of $8 million on an annualized basis. Credit Risk Distribution Operations Atlanta Gas Light has a concentration of credit risk as it bills nine certificated and active Marketers and one regulated natural gas provider responsible for offering natural gas to low income customers and customers unable to get natural gas service from other Marketers in Georgia for its services. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies with the time of the year, with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in Georgia. These retail functions include customer service, billing, collections, and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Lights tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketers highest months estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2009, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for approximately 31% of our consolidated operating margin and 44% of distribution operations operating margin. Several factors are designed to mitigate our risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. We accept credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities. The RMC reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each Marketer. We believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify, manage and report on Atlanta Gas Lights credit risk exposure to Marketers. Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. Retail Energy Operations SouthStar obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed SouthStars credit threshold. SouthStar considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on a review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, SouthStar also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties Moodys, S&P and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements. Wholesale Services Sequent has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Sequent also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Sequent is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Sequents credit risk. Sequent also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Master netting agreements enable Sequent to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Sequent also nets across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. Additionally, Sequent may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Sequent conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for its counterpartys line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long term debt rating of Baa3 from Moodys and BBB from S&P. Generally, Sequent requires credit enhancements by way of guaranty, cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings. Glossary of Key Terms 43 Table of Contents Sequent, which provides services to retail marketers and utility and industrial customers, also has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30 day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. As of December 31, 2009, Sequents top 20 counterparties represented approximately 58% of the total counterparty exposure of $534 million, derived by adding together the top 20 counterparties exposures and dividing by the total of Sequents counterparties exposures. As of December 31, 2009, Sequents counterparties, or the counterparties guarantors, had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A , which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moodys ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moodys and 1 being D or Default by S&P and Moodys. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to an S&P equivalent. There were no credit defaults with Sequents counterparties. The following table shows Sequents third party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions. As of Dec. 31, Gross receivables In millions 2009 2008 Netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade $ 483 $ 398 Counterparty is non investment grade 12 15 Counterparty has no external rating 106 129 No netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade 14 7 Counterparty is non investment grade Amount recorded on statements of financial position $ 615 $ 549 As of Dec. 31, Gross payables In millions 2009 2008 Netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade $ 277 $ 266 Counterparty is non investment grade 34 41 Counterparty has no external rating 207 228 No netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade 6 4 Counterparty is non investment grade Amount recorded on statements of financial position $ 524 $ 539 Sequent has certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Sequent would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. If such collateral were not posted, Sequents ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired. If our credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade status, the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between Sequent and its counterparties would have totaled $25 million at December 31, 2009, which would not have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
