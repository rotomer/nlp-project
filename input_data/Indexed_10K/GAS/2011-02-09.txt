ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Our distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the six states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders. With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas and general economic conditions that may impact our customers ability to pay for gas consumed. Various mechanisms exist that limit our exp osure to weather changes within specified ranges in all of our jurisdictions. Our retail energy operations segment, which consists of SouthStar, also is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to mitigate potential weather impacts. Sequent, our wholly owned subsidiary within our wholesale services segment is temperature insensitive, but generally has greater opportunity to capture operating margin due to price volatility as a result of extreme weather. Our energy investments segments primary activity is our natural gas storage business, which develops, acquires and operates high deliverability salt dome storage assets in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. While this business also can generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, the majority of our storage services are covered under medium to long term contracts at a fixed market rate. For more information on our operating segments, see Item 1, Business. Executive Summary Proposed merger with Nicor In December 2010, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Nicor, which we expect to complete in the second half of 2011. The proposed merger will create a combined company with increased scale and scope in both regulated utility and non regulated businesses as indicated below: Seven regulated natural gas distribution companies providing natural gas services to approximately 4.5 million customers in Illinois, Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee and Maryland Over 1 million retail customers in the unregulated businesses Physical wholesale gas business delivering approximately 4.7 Bcf of natural gas per day Natural gas storage facilities that will provide approximately 31 Bcf of storage in 2012 Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by, among others, the Illinois Commerce Commission. We anticipate that the necessary approvals will be obtained. In January 2011, we filed a joint application with Nicor to the Illinois Commerce Commission for approval of the proposed merger. As stated above, approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission is a condition to completion of the merger. The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicors gas distribution subsidiary at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion. The Illinois Commerce Commission has eleven months to act upon the application; however, we and Nicor have asked for approval of the merger by October 1, 2011 . The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Nicor, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances. For additional information relating to the proposed merger please see our Form 8 K filed on December 7, 2010. Further information concerning the proposed merger was included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S 4 that was filed with the SEC on February 4, 2011. Legislative and regulatory update We continue to actively pursue a regulatory strategy that improves customer service and reduces the lag between our investments in infrastructure and the recovery of those investments through various rate mechanisms. If our rate design approvals are not approved, we will continue to work cooperatively with our regulators, legislators and others to create a framework that is conducive to our business goals and the interests of our customers and shareholders. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) was enacted in July 2010, representing an overhaul of the framework for regulation of United States financial markets. We are currently evaluating the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act and the potential impact that it may have on us. Glossary of Key Terms 28 Table of Contents However, we believe that an aspect of the Dodd Frank Act which requires that various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, establish additional regulations for participating in financial markets for hedging certain risks inherent in our business, including commodity and interest rate risks, may be applicable to us. As a result, the costs of participating in financial markets for hedging certain risks may be increased as a result of the new legislation. We may also incur additional costs associated with our compliance with new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations. For additional information on our regulatory strategy see Item 1, &#822 0;Business under the caption Regulatory Planning. Customer growth initiatives Relative to recent years, we continue to see higher than normal rates of unemployment, depressed housing markets with high inventories, significantly reduced new home construction and a slow down in new commercial development. As a result, we experienced slight customer losses in our distribution operations and retail energy operations segments throughout 2010. We have largely offset this trend by implementing customer attrition mitigation strategies to retain existing customers at all of our utilities. We expect a similar environment to prevail throughout 2011. We use a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. These efforts include working to add residential customers, multifamily complexes and commercial customers who use natural gas for purposes other than space heating, as well as evaluating and launching new natural gas related programs, products and services to enhance customer growth, mitigate customer attrition and increase operating revenues. These programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. Natural gas price volatility The volatility of natural gas commodity prices have a significant impact on our customer rates, our long term competitive position against other energy sources and the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. During 2008 and 2009, daily Henry Hub spot market prices for natural gas in the United States were extremely volatile. However, during 2010, the volatility of natural gas prices was lower than it has been for the last few years as a result of a robust natural gas supply, the weak economy and ample storage. Our natural gas acquisition strategy is designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility cus tomers and to hedge gas prices to effectively manage costs, reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage. Additionally, our hedging strategies and physical natural gas supplies in storage enable us to reduce earnings risk exposure due to higher gas costs. It is possible that natural gas prices will remain low for an extended period based on current levels of excess supply relative to market demand for natural gas, in part due to abundant sources of new shale natural gas reserves and the lack of demand by commercial and industrial enterprises. However, as economic conditions improve the demand for natural gas may increase, natural gas prices could rise and higher volatility could return to the natural gas markets. Capital market plan Our capital market plan for the remainder of 2011 includes successfully completing offerings of approximately $1 billion in long term debt and $1.4 billion in common stock to finance the proposed Nicor merger and maintaining our solid investment grade credit ratings. For additional information on our Credit Facility and our capital market plan see Liquidity and Capital Resources under the caption Cash Flow from Financing Activities and Short term Debt. See also Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Hedges Changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of our operations to earnings variability. Our non utility businesses principally use physical and financial arrangements to reduce the risks associated with both weather related seasonal fluctuations in market conditions and changing commodity prices. These economic hedges may not qualify, or are not designated for, hedge accounting treatment. As a result, our reported earnings for the wholesale services and retail energy operations segments reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating revenues or our OCI for those derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as accounting hedges . Seasonality The operating revenues and EBIT of our distribution operations, retail energy operations and wholesale services segments are seasonal. During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher because more customers are connected to our distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, Sequents operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain statements of financial position items such as receivables, unbilled revenue, inventories and short term debt across quarters. However, these items are comparable when reviewing our annual results. Glossary of Key Terms 29 Table of Contents Approximately 70% of these segments operating revenues and 78% of these segments EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2010 were generated during the first and fourth quarters of 2010, and are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2010. Our base operating expenses, excluding cost of gas, interest expense and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, our operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. Results of Operations We generate nearly all our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. We include in our consolidated revenues an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed, to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. No individual customer or industry accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. The following table provides more information regarding the components of our operating revenues. In millions 2010 2009 2008 Residential $ 1,083 $ 1,091 $ 1,194 Commercial 521 467 598 Transportation 404 378 459 Industrial 205 185 322 Other 160 196 227 Total operating revenues $ 2,373 $ 2,317 $ 2,800 We evaluate segment performance using the measures of operating margin and EBIT, which include the effects of corporate expense allocations. Operating margin is a non GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues minus cost of gas, which excludes operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and the gain or loss on the sale of our assets. These items are included in our calculation of operating income as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income. EBIT is also a non GAAP measure that includes operating income, other income and expenses. Items that we do not include in EBIT are financing costs, including interest and debt expense and income taxes, each of which we evaluate on a consolidated basis. We believe operating margin is a better indicator than operating revenues for the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of gas can vary significantly and is generally billed directly to our customers. We also consider operating margin to be a better indicator in our retail energy operations, wholesale services and energy investments segments since it is a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs. We believe EBIT is a useful measurement of our operating segments performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective, exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes, neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations. You should not consider operating margin or EBIT an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, our operating performance than operating income, or net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and EBIT measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table reconciles operating margin to operating income and EBIT to earnings before income taxes and net income, together with other consolidated financial information for the last three years. In millions 2010 2009 2008 Operating revenues $ 2,373 $ 2,317 $ 2,800 Cost of gas 1,164 1,142 1,654 Operating margin 1,209 1,175 1,146 Operating expenses 709 699 668 Operating income 500 476 478 Other (expense) income (1 ) 9 6 EBIT 499 485 484 Interest expenses 109 101 115 Earnings before income taxes 390 384 369 Income tax expenses 140 135 132 Net income 250 249 237 Less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 16 27 20 Net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. $ 234 $ 222 $ 217 In 2010, our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. increased by $12 million from the prior year primarily due to increased EBIT at distribution operations largely due to new rates at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas as well as the completion of the Hampton Roads and Magnolia pipeline projects. The increase in our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. was also favorably impacted by increased EBIT at wholesale services and our additional 15% ownership interest in SouthStar, which was effective January 1, 2010. This was partly offset by increased interest expense and decreased EBIT at retail energy operations, energy investments and corporate. The decrease in EBIT at retail energy operations was mainly due to increased operating expenses. The decrease in EBIT at energy investments was the result of decreased operating margins mainly due to the sale of AGL Networks. The decrease in EBIT at corporate was mainly due to approximately $6 million of outside services expenses associated with non recurring transaction costs associated with the proposed merger with Nicor. Glossary of Key Terms 30 Table of Contents In 2009, our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. increased by $5 million from the prior year primarily due to decreased interest expense and increased EBIT from retail energy operations largely due to higher operating margin. This was partly offset by decreased EBIT at distribution operations, wholesale services and energy investments. The decrease in EBIT at distribution operations was primarily due to increased operating expenses offset by increased operating margin. The decrease in EBIT at wholesale services and energy investments was the result of decreased operating margins and increased operating expenses. The following table provides each operating segments percentage contribution to the total EBIT for our operating segments for the last three years. 2010 2009 2008 Distribution operations 69 % 67 % $ 68 % Retail energy operations 20 21 16 Wholesale services 10 10 12 Energy investments 1 2 $ 4 Total EBIT 100 % 100 % 100 % Over the last three years, on average, we have derived 69% of our operating segments EBIT from our regulated natural gas distribution business whose rates are approved by state regulatory commissions. We derived our remaining operating segments EBIT for the last three years principally from businesses that are complementary to our natural gas distribution business. These businesses include the sale of natural gas to retail customers, natural gas asset management and the operation of high deliverability natural gas underground storage as ancillary activities to our regulated utility franchises. Interest expense Our interest expense over the last three years has fluctuated primarily due to short term interest rate changes and higher average debt levels. The following table provides additional detail on interest expense for the last three years and the primary items that affect year over year change. In millions 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 109 $ 101 $ 115 Average debt outstanding (1) $ 2,393 $ 2,239 $ 2,156 Average rate 4.6 % 4.5 % 5.3 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. The difficult economic conditions of the past few years have resulted in low United States Treasury yields and corresponding indexes on short term borrowings. These factors have favorably impacted our earnings in 2010, 2009 and 2008 through reduced short term rates that we paid on our commercial paper borrowings. For more information on the impact that interest rate fluctuations have on our variable rate debt, see Interest Rate Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Income tax expense Our income tax expense in 2010 increased by $5 million or 4% compared to 2009, and increased by $3 million or 2% in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases were primarily due to higher consolidated earnings. Our effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2010 and 37.8% in 2009 and 2008. As a result of the authoritative guidance related to consolidations, income tax expense and our effective tax rate are determined from earnings before income taxes less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest. For more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective rate, see Note 11. Operating metrics Selected weather, customer and volume metrics for 2010, 2009 and 2008, which we consider to be some of the key performance indicators for our operating segments, are presented in the following tables. We measure the effects of weather on our business through heating degree days. Generally, increased heating degree days result in greater demand for gas on our distribution systems. However, extended and unusually mild weather during the Heating Season can have a significant negative impact on demand for natural gas. Our customer metrics highlight the average number of customers to which we provide services. This number of customers can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions and competition from alternative fuels. Volume metrics for distribution operations and retail energy operations present the effects of weather and our customers demand for natural gas. Wholesale services daily physical sales represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers. Within our energy investments segment, our natural gas storage businesses generally prefer to have approximately 95% of their working natural gas capacity under firm subscription. This allows our natural gas storage business to generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, but retain consistency with their earnings.

The need for long term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long term debt. In addition, we anticipate incurring indebtedness in connection with financing the consideration for the proposed Nicor merger. The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is primarily provided by our operating activities. Our short term cash requirements not met by cash from operations are primarily satisfied with short term borrowings under our commercial paper program, which is supported by our Credit Facility. Periodically, we raise funds supporting our long term cash needs from the issuance of long term debt or equity securities. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short term and long term needs in a cost effective manner. Our capital market strategy has continued to focus on maintaining a strong Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, ensuring ample cash resources and daily liquidity, accessing capital markets at favorable times as needed, managing critical business risks and maintaining a balanced capital structure through the appropriate issuance of equity or long term debt securities. Our issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt and equity, is subject to customary approval or review by state and federal regulatory bodies including the various public service commissions of the states in which we conduct business, the SEC and the FERC. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flows are derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation. We believe the amounts available to us under our senior notes and Credit Facility, Bridge Facility, Term Loan Facility and through the issuance of debt and equity securities, combined with cash provided by our operating activities, will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, pension contributions, construction expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments, common share repurchases, financing requirements for the Nicor merger and other cash needs through the next several years. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and ot her factors, some of which we are unable to control. These factors include, among others regulatory changes, the price of natural gas, the demand for natural gas and operational risks. We will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies, the proposed merger with Nicor and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements. Cash Flows The following table provides a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the last three years. In millions 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 526 $ 592 $ 227 Investing activities (442 ) (476 ) (372 ) Financing activities (86 ) (106 ) 142 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (2 ) 10 (3 ) Cash and cash equivalent at beginning of period 26 16 19 Cash and cash equivalent at end of period $ 24 $ 26 $ 16 Cash Flow from Operating Activities We prepare our statement of cash flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes and changes in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. Year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily due to working capital changes within our distribution operations, retail energy operations and wholesale services segments resulting from the impact of weather, the price of natural gas, natural gas storage, the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries. The increase or decrease in the price of natural gas directly impacts the cost of gas stored in inventory. Glossary of Key Terms 35 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 In 2010, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $526 million, a decrease of $66 million or 11% from 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to 2009 within most of our service areas. As a result, the use of working capital for our gas receivables increased $134 million due to increased volumes sold to our customers. We also refunded an additional $38 million to our utility customers for billed commodity costs compared to 2009 as natural gas commodity cost recovery rates charged to customers were reduced as under recovered amounts were collected in part due to the decline in natural gas prices. This increased use of operating cash flow was mostly offset by decreased working capital used by Sequent of $128 million for its energy marketing activities, resulting from the timing of payments for gas purchases relative to collections of accounts receivable and an increase in Sequents daily physical sales. 2009 compared to 2008 In 2009, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $592 million, an increase of $365 million or 161% from 2008. The primary contributor to the recovery of working capital during 2009 was significantly lower natural gas commodity prices as compared to 2008. During 2008, the cost of natural gas increased significantly during the natural gas storage injection season. This resulted in a higher cost of inventories in 2008 as compared to 2009, and consequently higher customer bills and accounts receivable at the end of 2008. The higher receivable balances and inventory costs were billed to and /or collected from customers during 2009, which resulted in a $173 million increase in cash from the collection of our natural gas receivables and a $103 million increase in cash from our inventory withdrawals. As a result of the lower natural gas prices during 2009, we used less cash while refilling our natural gas inventories. The lower natural gas prices and associated inventory costs reduced customer bills at the end of 2009, allowing us to reduce our working capital needs. Also contributing to the higher operating cash flows was the return of cash collateral requirements posted during 2008 due to unrealized hedge losses resulting from the dramatic decline in natural gas prices during the second half of 2008 and into 2009. Cash collateral requirements decreased $200 million for our derivative financial instrument activities at Sequent and SouthStar due to the change in hedge values as forward NYMEX curve prices shifted downward in 2009 and as positions settled. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of PP&E expenditures. The majority of our PP&E expenditures are within our distribution operations and energy investment segments. Our estimated PP&E expenditures for 2011 and our actual PP&E expenditures incurred in 2010, 2009 and 2008 are shown within the following categories and are presented in the table below. Base business new construction and infrastructure improvements at our distribution operations segment Regulatory infrastructure programs Programs that update or expand our distribution systems and liquefied natural gas facilities to improve system reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. These programs include the pipeline replacement program and STRIDE at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas utility infrastructure enhancements program. Hampton Roads Virginia Natural Gas pipeline project, which connects its northern and southern systems Magnolia project pipelines which diversify our sources of natural gas by connecting our Georgia service territory to the Elba Island LNG terminal Natural gas storage salt dome cavern expansions at Golden Triangle Storage and Jefferson Island Other primarily includes information technology and building and leasehold improvements In millions 2008 2009 2010 2011 (1) Base business $ 131 $ 132 $ 159 $ 146 Regulatory infrastructure programs 70 76 186 175 Hampton Roads and Magnolia project 48 136 3 Natural gas storage 64 95 114 37 Other 59 37 48 81 Total $ 372 $ 476 $ 510 $ 439 (1) Estimated PP&E expenditures Our PP&E expenditures were $510 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $476 million for the same period in 2009. This increase of $34 million or 7% was primarily due to a $19 million increase in expenditures for the construction of the Golden Triangle Storage natural gas storage facility, $26 million in expenditures for Elizabethtown Gas utility infrastructure enhancements program and $84 million in expenditures for STRIDE and $38 million in other capital projects in distribution operations. This was offset by reduced expenditures of $133 million for the Hampton Roads and Magnolia projects, for which construction was substantially completed in 2009. The higher capital expenditures were further offset by $73 million in proceeds from the disposition of assets. Glossary of Key Terms 36 Table of Contents In 2009, our PP&E expenditures were $104 million or 28% higher than in 2008. This was primarily due to $43 million expended for the completed Magnolia project, $45 million in increased spending for the completed Hampton Roads pipeline project and an increase in our natural gas storage project expenditures of $31 million as we continued construction of our Golden Triangle Storage facility. This was largely offset by decreased expenditures of $22 million for the other category, primarily on information technology and building and leasehold improvements. Our estimated expenditures for 2011 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the base business, regulatory infrastructure programs and other categories. We continually evaluate whether to proceed with these projects, reviewing them in relation to factors including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. We will make adjustments to these discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of equity and debt securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, appropriate mix of debt with fixed to floating interest rates (our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt), as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities. As of December 31, 2010, our variable rate debt was $892 million or 33% of our total debt, compared to $762 million or 30% as of December 31, 2009. This increase was principally due to increased commercial paper borrowings. As of December 31, 2010, our commercial paper borrowings were $131 million or 22% higher than the same time last year, primarily a result of higher working capital requirements and increased capital expenditures. For more information on our debt, see Note 7. Our cash used in financing activities was $86 million in 2010 compared to cash used of $106 million in 2009. The decreased use of cash of $20 million was primarily due to increased commercial paper borrowings of $395 million in 2010 compared to 2009. This was partially offset by our issuance of $300 million of senior notes in August 2009. Additional offsets in 2010 include our purchase of an additional 15% ownership interest in SouthStar for $58 million, an increase in dividends paid on common shares of $6 million, purchase of treasury shares of $7 million and an increased distribution to the noncontrolling interest of $7 million. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain adequate and cost effective financing are directly impacted by our credit ratings as well as the availability of financial markets. In addition, credit ratings are important to counterparties when we engage in certain transactions including OTC derivatives. It is our long term objective to maintain, or improve, our credit ratings to manage our existing financing cost and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and may periodically change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating agencies regularly review our performance, prospects and financial condition and reevaluate their ratings of our long term debt and short term borrowings, including our corporate ratings. There is no guarantee that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Factors we consider important in assessing our credit ratings include our statements of financial position leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2010. S&P Moodys Fitch Corporate rating A A Commercial paper A 2 P 2 F2 Senior unsecured BBB+ Baa1 A Ratings outlook Negative Stable Stable Subsequent to the announcement of our proposed merger with Nicor, S&P placed our long term debt ratings and our A corporate credit ratings on credit watch with negative implications. The primary reason for this change is the increased leverage we will assume to complete the proposed merger and the uncertainties that exist with the proposed merger. S&Ps rating for our commercial paper was affirmed A 2. Moodys and Fitch each affirmed stable outlooks for their ratings of our debt obligations based on our sufficient equity as part of the financing for the proposed merger. Glossary of Key Terms 37 Table of Contents Our credit ratings depend largely on our financial performance, and a downgrade in our current ratings, particularly below investment grade, could adversely affect our borrowing costs and significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. Merger Financing Agreements In December 2010, we amended our existing Credit Facility to allow for the closing of the proposed merger with Nicor. Additionally, in December 2010, we entered into a $1.05 billion Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility may be used to partially finance the cash portion of our proposed merger with Nicor and pay related fees and expenses in the event that permanent financing is not available at the time of the closing of the proposed merger. The Bridge Facility matures 364 days after funds are borrowed and any repaid amounts under the Bridge Facility may not be re borrowed. The interest rate applicable to the Bridge Facility is the higher of (i) at our option, a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% based on our credit rating, and the applicable interest rate option, and subject to a 0.25% increase for each 90 day period that elapses after the closing of the Bridge Facility or (ii) the highest interest rate we or any of our subsidiaries are paying on any similar facility. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Bridge Facility. We do not currently plan to draw on our Bridge Facility to fund the proposed merger with Nicor, as we anticipate having more permanent financing in place subsequent to receipt of all regulatory approvals. Default Provisions Our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment, additional collateral support or similar actions. Our Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay any interest or principal when due, the failure to furnish financial statements within the timeframe established by each debt facility, the failure to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, cross defaults to certain other material indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, incorrect or misleading representations or warranties, insolvency or bankruptcy, fundamental change of control, the occurrence of certain Employee Retirement Income Security Act events, judgment s in excess of specified amounts and certain impairments to the guarantee. Our Credit Facility contains certain non financial covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, loans and investments, acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, asset dispositions, mergers and consolidations and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Our Credit Facility also includes a financial covenant that does not permit our ratio, on a consolidated basis, of total debt to total capitalization to exceed 70% (excluding for these purposes, debt incurred to partially refinance the Bridge Facility during the period prior to funding under the Bridge Facility) at the end of any fiscal month. This ratio, as defined within our debt agreements, includes standby letters of credit, performance/surety bonds and the exclusion of other comprehensive income pension adjustments. Adjusting for these items, our ratio, on a consolidated basis, of total debt to total capitalization was 58% at December 31, 2010 and 57% at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were in compliance with all of our existing debt provisions and covenants, both financial and non financial. Additionally, our Bridge Facility and Term Loan facility each contain the same financial covenant and similar non financial covenants and default provisions; however, these are not effective until we draw under these facilities. Our ratio, on a consolidated basis, of total debt to total capitalization is typically greater at the beginning of the Heating Season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund our natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to maintain our capitalization ratio in a target range of 50% to 60%. Accomplishing this capital structure objective and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings. The components of our capital structure, as calculated from our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, as of the dates indicated, are provided in the following table. In millions December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Short term debt $ 1,033 23 % $ 602 14 % Long term debt 1,673 37 1,974 45 Total debt 2,706 60 2,576 59 Equity 1,836 40 1,819 41 Total capitalization $ 4,542 100 % $ 4,395 100 % Short term Debt Our short term debt is composed of borrowings and payments under our Credit Facility and commercial paper program, lines of credit and payments of the current portion of our capital leases and our senior notes maturing in less than one year. Glossary of Key Terms 38 Table of Contents In millions Year end balance outstanding (1) Daily average balance outstanding (2) Largest balance outstanding (2) Commercial paper $ 732 $ 419 $ 760 Senior notes 300 300 300 Capital leases 1 1 1 Total short term debt $ 1,033 $ 720 $ 1,061 (1) As of December 31, 2010. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest amounts borrowed on our commercial paper borrowings are important when assessing the intra period fluctuation of our short term borrowings and any potential liquidity risk. Our year end short term debt outstanding and our largest short term debt balance outstanding are significantly higher than our average short term debt outstanding during 2010 due to our seasonal short term cash requirements. Such cash requirements generally increase between June and December as we purchase natural gas and pipeline capacity in advance of the Heating Season. The variation of when we pay our suppliers for natural gas purchases and pipeline capacity and when we recover our costs from our customers through their monthly bills can significantly affect our short term cash requirements. Our short term debt balances are typically reduced during the Heating Season because a significant portion of our current assets, primarily natural gas inventories, are converted into cash in the Heating Season. Additionally, increasing natural gas commodity prices can have a significant impact on our commercial paper borrowings. Based on current natural gas prices and our expected purchases during the upcoming injection season, a $1 increase per Mcf in natural gas prices could result in an additional $60 to $70 million of working capital requirements during the peak of the Heating Season based upon our current injection plan. This range is sensitive to the timing of storage injections and withdrawals, collateral requirements and our portfolio position. In September 2010, we entered into our new Credit Facility. The new Credit Facility matures in September 2013, and replaced our previous $1 billion facility that was due to expire during 2011. The new Credit Facility allows us to borrow up to $1 billion on a revolving basis, and includes an option to increase the Credit Facility to $1.25 billion, subject to the agreement by lenders who wish to participate in such an increase. The new Credit Facility may be used to provide for working capital, finance certain permitted acquisitions, issue up to $250 million in letters of credit and for general corporate purposes including to provide commercial paper backstop, fund capital expenditures, make repurchases of capital stock a nd repay existing indebtedness. In December 2010, we amended our Credit Facility in connection with the Nicor merger to, among other things, increase the accordion feature from $250 million to $750 million. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. In December 2010, we entered into a $300 million Term Loan Facility to help repay the senior notes that matured in January 2011. The Term Loan Facility matures 180 days after the funds are borrowed. The interest rate applicable to the Term Loan Facility is, at our option, a floating base rate or a floating Eurodollar rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% based on our credit rating and interest rate option. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility. However, subsequent to year end, along with $150 million of commercial paper borrowings we borrowed $150 million under the Term Loan Facility to repay the $300 million of senior notes that matured in January 2011. In February 2011, we intend to use commercial paper borrowings to repay the $150 million currently outstanding under the Ter m Loan Facility. SouthStar has a $75 million line of credit which is used for its working capital and general corporate needs. Additionally, Sequent has a $5 million line of credit that bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus 3.0%. Sequents line of credit is used solely for the posting of margin deposits for NYMEX transactions and is unconditionally guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings on either of these lines of credit. The lenders under our Credit Facility, Bridge Facility, Term Loan Facility and lines of credit are major financial institutions with approximately $2.6 billion of committed balances and all have investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2010.Based on current credit market conditions, it is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency. However, based on our current assessment of our lenders creditworthiness, we believe the risk of lender default is minimal. Long term Debt Our long term debt matures more than one year from December 31, 2010 and consists of medium term notes, senior notes, gas facility revenue bonds, and capital leases. Our long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures, long term debt maturities and decisions to refinance long term debt. The following represents our long term debt activity over the last three years. Glossary of Key Terms 39 Table of Contents Gas Facility Revenue Bonds In June and September 2008, we refinanced $160 million of our gas facility revenue bonds. There was no change to the maturity dates of these bonds. In October 2010, we completed the remarketing of $160 million of gas facility revenue bonds with rates that reset daily. As part of the remarketing, we entered into new agreements with remarketing agents to resell the bonds to investors. We established new letters of credit to provide credit enhancement to the bonds. The weighted average interest rates on our variable rate bonds during 2010 ranged from 0.23% to 0.36%. Senior notes In August 2009, we issued $300 million of 10 year senior notes at an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $297 million. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay a portion of our short term debt. We had $300 million of senior notes that matured in January 2011, which, as of December 31, 2010, were reported as the current portion of long term debt on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. These senior notes were repaid in January 2011 with $150 million of our commercial paper and $150 million borrowed under our Term Loan Facility. Noncontrolling Interest We recorded cash distributions for SouthStars dividend distributions to Piedmont of $27 million in 2010, $20 million in 2009 and $30 million in 2008 in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as financing activities. Dividends on Common Stock Our common stock dividend payments were $133 million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $124 million in 2008. The increases were generally the result of annual dividend increases of $0.04 per share for each of the last three years. For information about restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Methods of Application. Treasury Shares In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to purchase up to 8 million shares of our outstanding common stock over a five year period. These purchases are intended principally to offset share issuances under our employee and non employee director incentive compensation plans and our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases under this program may be made in the open market or in private transactions at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of common shares that we will purchase, and we can terminate or limit the program at any time. This program expired in January 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we purchased approximately 0.2 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost of $36.01 per common share and an aggregate cost of $7 million. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not purchase shares of our common stock. We currently anticipate holding the purchased shares as treasury shares. For more information on our common share repurchases see Item 5 Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Shelf Registration On August 17, 2010, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC, which expires in 2013. Debt securities and related guarantees issued under the shelf registration will be issued by AGL Capital under an indenture dated as of February 20, 2001, as supplemented and modified, as necessary, among AGL Capital, AGL Resources and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The indenture provides for the issuance from time to time of debt securities in an unlimited dollar amount and an unlimited number of series, subject to our Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility financial covenants related to total debt to total capitalization. The debt securities will be guaranteed by AGL Resources. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. Glossary of Key Terms 40 Table of Contents The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligation payments such as debt and lease agreements, and commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2010. 2012 & 2014 & 2016 & In millions Total 2011 2013 2015 thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,673 $ $ 242 $ 200 $ 1,231 Short term debt (1) 1,033 1,033 Pipeline replacement program costs (2) 228 62 166 Environmental remediation liabilities (2) 143 14 62 53 14 Total $ 3,077 $ 1,109 $ 470 $ 253 $ 1,245 Unrecorded contractual obligations and commitments (3) (9): Pipeline charges, storage capacity and gas supply (4) $ 1,899 $ 523 $ 663 $ 262 $ 451 Interest charges (5) 897 89 166 144 498 Operating leases (6) 95 22 30 13 30 Pension contributions (7) 30 30 Asset management agreements (8) 15 10 3 2 Standby letters of credit, performance / surety bonds (10) 14 12 2 Total $ 2,950 $ 686 $ 864 $ 421 $ 979 (1) Includes current portion of long term debt of $300 million which matured and was repaid in January 2011. (2) Includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms. (3) In accordance with GAAP, these items are not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. (4) Includes charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism or alternatively billed to Marketers and demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply amount includes SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 14 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2010, and is valued at $63 million. As we do for other subsidiaries, we provide guarantees to certain gas suppliers for SouthStar in support of payment obligations. (5) Floating rate debt is based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2010 and the maturity date of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2010, we have $40 million of accrued interest on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that will be paid in 2011. (6) We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to leases. However, this lease accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flow from operating and financing activities. (7) Based on the current funding status of the plans, we would be required to make a minimum contribution to our pension plans of approximately $30 million in 2011. We may make additional contributions in 2011. (8) Represent fixed fee minimum payments for Sequents affiliated asset management agreements. (9) The Merger Agreement with Nicor contains termination rights for both us and Nicor and provides that, if we terminate the agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million. In addition, if we terminate the agreement due to a failure to obtain the necessary financing for the transaction, we may also be required to pay Nicor $115 million. (10) We provide guarantees to certain gas suppliers of SouthStar in support of payment obligations. Standby letters of credit and performance / surety bonds. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows. Pension and postretirement obligations. Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Pension Protection Act. Additionally, we calculate any required pension contributions using the traditional unit credit cost method. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Glossary of Key Terms 41 Table of Contents The state regulatory commissions have phase ins that defer a portion of the postretirement benefit expense for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $9 million as of December 31, 2010 and $10 million as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we recorded a regulatory liability of $6 million as of December 31, 2010 and $5 million as of December 31, 2009 for our expected expenses under the AGL Postretirement Plan. See Note 5 Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information about our pension and postretirement plans In 2010, we contributed $31 million to our qualified pension plans. In 2009, we contributed $24 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on the current funding status of the plans, we would be required to make a minimum contribution to the plans of approximately $30 million in 2011. We are planning to make additional contributions in 2011 up to $31 million, for a total of up to $61 million, in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our financial statements because they result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We frequently re evaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following represents those that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty, judgment and complexity; these include Regulatory Infrastructure Program Liabilities, Environmental Remediation Liabilities, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, Contingencies, Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Income Taxes. Regulatory Infrastructure Program Liabilities We record regulatory assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in accordance with authoritative guidance related to regulated entities. We record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery is probable through either rate riders or base rates specifically authorized by a state regulatory commission. We record regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the rate making process. By order of the Georgia Commission, our wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light began a pipeline replacement program to replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system by December 2013. The order provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program, which Atlanta Gas Light has recorded as a regulatory asset. Atlanta Gas Light will recover from end use customers, through billings to Marketers, the costs related to the program net of any cost savings from the program. All such amounts will be recovered through a combination of straight fixed variable rates and a pipeline replacement revenue rider. The regulatory asset has two components (i) the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders, and (ii) the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders. The determination of future expected costs associated with our pipeline replacement program liabilities involves judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the future expected costs are: projected capital expenditure spending, including labor and material costs the remaining pipeline footage to be replaced for remainder of the program changes in the regulatory environment or our completive position passage of new legislation changes in accounting guidance To the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are adjusted accordingly. We recorded a long term liability of $166 million as of December 31, 2010 and $155 million as of December 31, 2009, which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the pipeline replacement program. As of December 31, 2010, we had recorded a current liability of $62 million, representing expected pipeline replacement program expenditures for the next 12 months. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. If Atlanta Gas Lights pipeline replacement program expenditures, subject to future recovery, were $10 million higher or lower its incremental expected annual revenues would have changed by approximately $1 million. Details of our regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in Note 2. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to legislation and regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters. Additionally, we owned and operated a number of MGP sites at which hazardous substances may be present. In accordance with GAAP, we have established reserves for environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated. We historically reported estimates of future environmental remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs. We presently report estimates of future remediation costs on an undiscounted basis. These estimates contain various engineering uncertainties, and we continuously attempt to refine these estimates. Glossary of Key Terms 42 Table of Contents In Georgia and Florida, we have confirmed 14 former MGP sites where Atlanta Gas Light owned or operated all or part of these sites. Atlanta Gas Lights environmental remediation liability is included in its corresponding regulatory asset. Our recovery of these environmental remediation costs is subject to review by the Georgia Commission, which may seek to disallow the recovery of some expenses. We have identified 6 former operating sites in New Jersey, where Elizabethtown Gas is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The New Jersey BPU has authorized Elizabethtown Gas to recover prudently incurred remediation costs for the New Jersey properties through its remediation adjustment clause. We also own remediation sites in other states. One site, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, is subject to an order by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. There is one other site in North Carolina where investigation and remediation is possible. We do not believe costs associated with this site can be reasonably estimated. There are no cost recovery mechanisms for the environmental remediation sites in North Carolina. We cannot perform precise engineering soil and groundwater clean up estimates for certain of our former MGP sites. As we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter into cleanup contracts, we are increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of the remediation program. The following table provides more information on our former operating sites: In millions Cost estimate range Amount recorded Expected costs over next twelve months Georgia and Florida $ 57 $105 $ 57 $ 3 New Jersey 75 138 75 10 North Carolina 11 16 11 1 Total $ 143 $259 $ 143 $ 14 In accordance with GAAP we have recorded the lower end of the range. Beyond 2012, these costs cannot be estimated and considerable variability remains in available estimates. Details of our environmental remediation costs are discussed in Note 2 and Note 10. Derivatives and Hedging Activities The authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging requires that every derivative financial instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the statements of financial position as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for and is designated as a normal purchase and sale, it is exempted from the fair value accounting treatment and is subject to traditional accrual accounting. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique. The guidance requires that changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, the guidance allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, the guidance requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce the impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas. The fair value of natural gas derivative financial instruments we use to manage exposures arising from changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. Glossary of Key Terms 43 Table of Contents Additionally, as required by the authoritative guidance, we are required to classify our derivative financial assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The determination of the fair value of our derivative instruments incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include: the credit worthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit) events specific to a given counterparty the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities. We have recorded derivative financial instrument assets of $228 million at December 31, 2010 and $238 million at December 31, 2009. Additionally, we have recorded derivative financial liabilities of $48 million at December 31, 2010 and $62 million at December 31, 2009. In 2010, we recorded $46 million of losses and in 2009 we recorded $15 million of losses on our Consolidated Statements of Income. If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions we use in pricing our derivative assets or liabilities, we may experience a significant impact on our financial position, result of operations and cash flows. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 2 and Item 1, Business. Contingencies Our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities, including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, rate matters, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance related to contingencies. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates can be, and often are, revised either negatively or positively, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 10. Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates. We annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities and update when appropriate. The critical actuarial assumptions used to develop the required estimates for our pension and postretirement plans include the following key factors: assumed discount rates expected return on plan assets the market value of plan assets assumed mortality table assumed rates of retirement. The discount rate is utilized in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs. When establishing our discount rate, with the assistance of our actuaries, we consider certain market indices, including Moodys Corporate AA long term bond rate, the Citigroup Pension Liability rate, other high grade bond indices and a single equivalent discount rate derived utilizing the forecasted future cash flows in each year to the appropriate spot rates based on high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds. The expected long term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that years annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported results. For our largest pension plan, market performance also effects our market related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five year moving weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense. Glossary of Key Terms 44 Table of Contents In addition, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) or the MRVPA for our largest pension plan. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. During 2010, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $17 million related to our defined pension and postretirement benefit costs. We estimate that in 2011, we will record net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the range of $19 million to $21 million, a $2 million to $4 million increase compared to 2010. In determining our estimated expenses for 2011, our actuarial consultant assumed an 8.75% expected return on plan assets and a discount rate of 5.40% for the AGL Retirement Plan and 5.20% for the NUI Retirement Plan and for our postretirement plan. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal and retirement rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants. The following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions for our pension and postretirement plans while holding all other assumptions constant. In millions Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in APBO Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1 % $ / $ (4) / 4 Discount rate +/ 1 % (80) / 90 (7) / 7 See Note 5 for additional information on our pension and postretirement plans. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our income tax returns. For state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. We had a $3 million valuation allowance on $109 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. Our net long term deferred tax liability totaled $768 million at December 31, 2010. See Note 11 for additional information on our taxes. Accounting Developments In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to improve fair value measurement disclosures. The guidance requires us to separately disclose significant transfers of amounts between Levels 1 and 2 and the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) should separately present transfers in/out of Level 3 as well as purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. We are required to present fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and to disclose our valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value. The amended guidance became effective for us on January 1, 2010, with the exception of the presentation of Level 3 fair value measurements, which will be effective for us on January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For more information on our fair value measurements, see Note 3. In December 2010, the FASB provided additional guidance for performing Step 1 of the test for goodwill impairment when an entity has reporting units with zero or negative carrying values. Under the new guidance, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test must be performed when adverse qualitative factors indicate that goodwill is more likely than not impaired. Although the guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2011, our goodwill impairment analysis for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 indicates that the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceed their carrying values, and we did not take a goodwill impairment charge in the current year nor do we expect to take a charge in future years. The amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Glossary of Key Terms 45 Table of Contents In December 2010, the FASB issued clarification of the accounting guidance around disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations that occur in the current reporting period. The guidance requires us to present pro forma information in our comparative financial statements as if the acquisition date for any business combinations taking place in the current reporting period had occurred at the beginning of the prior year reporting period. We will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2011, and include any required pro forma information for our proposed merger with Nicor, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2011. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to risks associated with natural gas prices, interest rates and credit. Natural gas price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of natural gas. Interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations and in wholesale services. Our Risk Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with, and adherence to, the terms within these policies, including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels. Our RMC consists of members of senior management who monitor open natural gas price risk positions and other types of risk, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities. It is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the RMC to perform its monitoring functions. Natural Gas Price Risk Retail Energy Operations SouthStars use of derivative instruments is governed by a risk management policy, approved and monitored by its Finance and Risk Management Committee, which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. SouthStar routinely utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain natural gas price and weather risk inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and swap agreements. This includes the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. SouthStar uses these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins. Wholesale Services Sequent routinely uses various types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain natural gas price risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and financial swap agreements. Energy Investments Golden Triangle Storage uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas that will be purchased in future periods for pad gas and additional volumes of gas used to de water the cavern (de water gas) during the construction of storage caverns. Pad gas includes volumes of non working natural gas used to maintain the operational integrity of the caverns. De water gas is used to remove water from the cavern in anticipation of commercial service and will be sold after completion of de watering. We also use derivative financial instruments for asset optimization purposes. Consolidated The following tables include the fair values and average values of our consolidated derivative financial instruments as of the dates indicated. We base the average values on monthly averages for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Derivative financial instruments average fair values at December 31, In millions 2010 (1) 2009 (1) Asset $ 226 $ 194 Liability 70 97 (1) Excludes cash collateral amounts.

The sources of our net fair value at December 31, 2010, are as follows. In millions Prices actively quoted (Level 1) (1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) (2) Mature through 2011 $ (32 ) $ 82 Mature 2012 2013 (17 ) 31 Mature 2014 2016 11 Total derivative financial instruments (3) $ (49 ) $ 124 (1) Valued using NYMEX futures prices. (2) Valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers. (3) Excludes cash collateral amounts. Value at risk Our open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management, including the chief risk officer. Because we generally manage physical gas assets and economically protect our positions by hedging in the futures markets, our open exposure is generally immaterial, permitting us to operate within relatively low VaR limits. We employ daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risks of our open positions. We actively monitor open commodity positions and the resulting VaR. We also continue to maintain a relatively matched book, where our total buy volume is close to our sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a 1 day holding period, SouthStars portfolio of positions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were less than $0.1 million and Sequent had the following VaRs. In millions 2010 2009 2008 Period end $ 1.6 $ 2.4 $ 2.5 12 month average 1.3 1.8 1.8 High 3.0 3.3 3.1 Low 0.7 0.7 0.8 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows. Our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on $892 million of variable rate debt, which includes $732 million of our variable rate short term debt and $160 million of variable rate gas facility revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2010, a 100 basis point change in market interest rates from 0.4% to 1.4% would have resulted in an increase in pretax interest expense of $9 million on an annualized basis. Credit Risk Distribution Operations Atlanta Gas Light has a concentration of credit risk as it bills eleven certificated and active Marketers in Georgia for its services. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies with the time of the year, with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in Georgia. These retail functions include customer service, billing, collections, and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Lights tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketers highest months estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2010, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for approximately 31% of our consolidated operating margin and 43% of distribution operations operating margin. Several factors are designed to mitigate our risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. We accept credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities. The RMC reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each Marketer. We believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify, manage and report on Atlanta Gas Lights credit risk exposure to Marketers. Glossary of Key Terms 47 Table of Contents Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. Retail Energy Operations SouthStar obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed SouthStars credit threshold. SouthStar considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on a review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, SouthStar also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties Moodys, S&P and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements. Wholesale Services Sequent has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Sequent also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Sequent is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Sequents credit risk. Sequent also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions . Master netting agreements enable Sequent to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Sequent also nets across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. Additionally, Sequent may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Sequent conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for its counterpartys line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long term debt rating of Baa3 from Moodys and BBB from S&P. Generally, Sequent requires credit enhancements by way of guaranty, cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings. Sequent, which provides services to retail marketers and utility and industrial customers, also has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30 day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. As of December 31, 2010, excluding $61 million of customer deposits, Sequents top 20 counterparties represented approximately 56% of the total counterparty exposure of $598 million, derived by adding together the top 20 counterparties exposures, exclusive of customer deposits, and dividing by the total of Sequents counterparties exposures. As of December 31, 2010, Sequents counterparties, or the counterparties guarantors, had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of BBB+, which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moodys ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moodys and 1 being D or Default by S&P and Moodys. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to an S&P equivalent. There were no credit defaults with Sequents counterparties. The following table shows Sequents third party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions. Glossary of Key Terms 48 Table of Contents As of Dec. 31, Gross receivables In millions 2010 2009 Netting agreements in place and counterparty is: Investment grade $ 515 $ 483 Non investment grade 11 12 No external rating 260 106 No netting agreements in place and counterparty is: Investment grade 2 14 Amount recorded on statements of financial position $ 788 $ 615 As of Dec. 31, Gross payables In millions 2010 2009 Netting agreements in place and counterparty is: Investment grade $ 341 $ 277 Non investment grade 40 34 No external rating 363 207 No netting agreements in place and counterparty is: Investment grade 6 Amount recorded on statements of financial position $ 744 $ 524 Sequent has certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status. Under such circumstances, Sequent would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. If such collateral were not posted, Sequents ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired. If our credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade status, the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between Sequent and its counterparties would have totaled $39 million at December 31, 2010, which would not have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
