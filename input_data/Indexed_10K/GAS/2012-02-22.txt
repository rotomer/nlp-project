ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary Merger with Nicor On December 9, 2011, we closed the merger with Nicor. We are now the nations largest natural gas only distribution company based on customer count. The merger created a combined company with increased scale and scope in both regulated utility and non regulated businesses as indicated below: Seven regulated natural gas distribution companies providing natural gas services to approximately 4.5 million customers in Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee and Maryland Over 1 million retail customers in the unregulated businesses Physical wholesale gas business delivering approximately 5.2 Bcf of natural gas per day Natural gas storage facilities that are expected to provide approximately 31.8 Bcf of working gas storage capacity in 2012 As a result of our merger with Nicor some of our businesses have been reclassified to different segments. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional segment information including recasted prior period information. The following table provides more information on our segments. EBIT (2) Assets (3) Capital Expenditures (2) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Distribution operations 80 % 70 % 67 % 79 % 73 % 74 % 85 % 70 % 74 % Retail operations 18 21 22 4 3 4 1 1 1 Wholesale services 1 10 10 9 18 16 0 0 0 Midstream operations 2 1 1 4 6 5 8 25 23 Cargo shipping 0 n/a n/a 5 n/a n/a 0 n/a n/a Other (1) (1 ) (2 ) 0 (1 ) 0 1 6 4 2 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) The 2011 results exclude the effects of the $68 million of merger expenses which were reported within our other segment. (2) The year ending December 31, 2011 only includes 22 days of Nicor activity from December 10, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (3) The 2011 amounts include Nicor assets as of December 31, 2011. Over the last three years, on average, we have derived 72% of our operating segments EBIT from our regulated natural gas distribution business whose rates are approved by state regulatory commissions. We derived our remaining operating segments EBIT for the last three years principally from businesses that are complementary to our natural gas distribution business. These businesses include the sale of natural gas to retail customers, natural gas asset management and the operation of high deliverability natural gas underground storage as ancillary activities to our regulated utility franchises. The increased impact of the rate regulated distribution operations segment on our overall business is expected to reduce our exposure to market fluctuations. For additional information on the Nicor merger see Item 1 Business as well as Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Legislative and regulatory update We continue to actively pursue a regulatory strategy that improves customer service and reduces the lag between our investments in infrastructure and the recovery of those investments through various rate mechanisms. If our rate design proposals are not approved, we will continue to work cooperatively with our regulators, legislators and others to create a framework that is conducive to our business goals and the interests of our customers and shareholders. On December 20, 2011, the Virginia Commission approved an annual increase of $11 million in base rate revenues and established an authorized return on equity of 10% for Virginia Natural Gas with an overall return on rate base set at 7.38%. Additionally, $3.1 million of costs previously recovered through base rates will now be recovered through the companys gas cost recovery rate. Customers bills will be credited to refund the difference between the final approved rates and interim rate increase, which began with usage on and after October 1, 2011. The new rate is expected to increase the average residential customers monthly bill by less than $3.50 per month depending on usage. Customer growth initiatives While there has been some improvement in the economic conditions within the areas we serve, we continue to see higher rates of unemployment, depressed housing markets with high inventories, significantly reduced new home construction and a slow down in new commercial development. As a result, we have experienced only slight customer gains in our distribution operations and retail operations segments throughout 2011. Our year over year consolidated utility customer gain rate was 0.1% in 2011, compared to a loss rate of (0.1)% for 2010. We anticipate overall competition and customer trends in 2012 to be similar to our 2011 results. In addition, for the full year 2011 Nicor Gas increased their customer count by 0.4% compared to 0.2% for 2010. We use a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. These efforts include working to add residential customers, multifamily complexes and commercial customers who use natural gas for purposes other than space heating, as well as evaluating and launching new natural gas related programs, products and services to enhance customer growth, mitigate customer attrition and increase operating revenues. These programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. On October 10, 2011, Georgia Natural Gas was named the exclusive natural gas partner for the Delta Air Lines Inc. Delta SkyMiles Program in Georgia. This is a long term partnership and we expect it will help retain current customers as well as attract new customers from other Marketers in Georgia. 33 Natural gas price volatility Volatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the country. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on our customer rates, our long term competitive position against other energy sources and the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. During 2008 and 2009, daily Henry Hub spot market prices for natural gas in the United States were extremely volatile. However, during 2010 and 2011, the volatility of natural gas prices has been significantly lower than it had been for several prior years. This is the result of a robust natural gas supply, the weak economy, mild weather and ample storage. Our natural gas acquisition strategy is designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility customers and to hedge gas prices to effectively manage costs, reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage. Additionally, our hedging strategies and physical natural gas supplies in storage enable us to reduce earnings risk exposure due to higher gas costs. It is possible that natural gas prices will remain low for an extended period based on current levels of excess supply relative to market demand for natural gas, in part due to abundant sources of new shale natural gas reserves and the lack of demand by commercial and industrial enterprises. However, as economic conditions improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, natural gas prices could rise and higher volatility could return to the natural gas markets. Consequently, we are working to reposition our wholesales services business model with respect to fixed costs and the types of contracts pursued and executed. Hedges Changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of our operations to earnings variability. Our non utility businesses principally use physical and financial arrangements to reduce the risks associated with both weather related seasonal fluctuations in market conditions and changing commodity prices. These economic hedges may not qualify, or are not designated for, hedge accounting treatment. As a result, our reported earnings for the wholesale services, retail operations and midstream operations segments reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives. These values may change significantly from period to period and are reflected as gains or losses within our operating revenues or our OCI for those derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as accounting hedges. Seasonality The operating revenues and EBIT of our distribution operations, retail operations, wholesale services and cargo shipping segments are seasonal. During the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher because more customers are connected to our distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale services operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain Statements of Financial Position items such as receivables, unbilled revenue, inventories and short term debt across quarters. However, these items are comparable when reviewing our annual results. Additionally, the revenues of our cargo shipping business are generally higher in the fourth quarter as our customers require more tourist related shipments as the hotels, resorts, and cruise ships typically have increased occupancy rates commencing in the fourth quarter and increasing further into the first quarter and consumer spending increases during traditional holiday periods. Approximately 71% of these segments operating revenues and 92% of these segments EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2011 were generated during the first and fourth quarters of 2011, and are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2011. Our base operating expenses, excluding cost of goods sold, interest expense and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, our operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. Results of Operations We generate the majority of our operating revenues through the sale, distribution and storage of natural gas. We include in our consolidated revenues an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed, but not yet billed, to residential, commercial and industrial customers from the date of the last bill to the end of the reporting period. No individual customer or industry accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. As a result of our merger with Nicor, our results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2011 includes 22 days of Nicor activity from December 10, 2011 through December 31, 2011. See Note 3 for additional merger related information and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information regarding reclassification of our business segments. The following table provides more information regarding the components of our operating revenues. 34 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Residential $ 1,065 $ 1,083 $ 1,091 Commercial 467 521 467 Transportation 403 404 378 Industrial 289 205 185 Other 114 160 196 Total operating revenues $ 2,338 $ 2,373 $ 2,317 We evaluate segment performance using the measures of operating margin and EBIT, which include the effects of corporate expense allocations. Operating margin is a non GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues minus cost of goods sold and revenue tax expense in distribution operations. Operating margin excludes operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, and the gain or loss on the sale of our assets. These items are included in our calculation of operating income as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income. EBIT is also a non GAAP measure that includes operating income and other income and expenses. Items that we do not include in EBIT are financing costs, including interest and debt expense and income taxes, each of which we evaluate on a consolidated basis. We believe operating margin is a better indicator than operating revenues for the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of goods sold and revenue tax expenses can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to our customers. We also consider operating margin to be a better indicator in our retail operations, wholesale services, midstream operations and cargo shipping segments since it is a direct measure of operating margin before overhead costs. We believe EBIT is a useful measurement of our operating segments performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective, exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes, neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations. You should not consider operating margin or EBIT an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, our operating performance than operating income, or net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our operating margin and EBIT measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table reconciles operating revenue and operating margin to operating income and EBIT to earnings before income taxes and net income, together with other consolidated financial information for the last three years. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Operating revenues $ 2,338 $ 2,373 $ 2,317 Cost of goods sold (1,097 ) (1,164 ) (1,142 ) Revenue tax expense (1) (9 ) 0 0 Operating margin 1,232 1,209 1,175 Operating expenses (2) (733 ) (703 ) (699 ) Revenue tax expense (1) 9 0 0 Nicor merger expenses (3) (68 ) (6 ) 0 Operating income 440 500 476 Other income (expense) 7 (1 ) 9 EBIT 447 499 485 Interest expenses 136 109 101 Earnings before income taxes 311 390 384 Income tax expenses 125 140 135 Net income 186 250 249 Less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 14 16 27 Net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. $ 172 $ 234 $ 222 (1) Adjusted for revenue tax expenses for Nicor Gas which are passed directly through to customers. (2) Excludes transaction expenses associated with the merger with Nicor of approximately $68 million ($55 million net of tax) in 2011 and $6 million ($4 million net of tax) in 2010. (3) Transaction expenses associated with the Nicor merger are part of operating expenses, but are shown separately to better compare year over year results. In 2011, our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. decreased by $62 million or 26% compared to last year. The decrease was primarily the result of approximately $68 million ($55 million net of tax) of transaction expenses associated with the merger with Nicor in 2011, which were expensed as incurred. We incurred approximately $6 million ($4 million net of tax) of Nicor transaction costs in 2010. Additionally, we experienced reduced EBIT at wholesale services and retail energy operations due to decreased average customer usage, warmer weather, losses associated with pipeline constraints in the Marcellus shale gas region and significantly lower natural gas volatility. This decrease was partially offset by higher EBIT at distribution operations due to increased revenues from new rates at Atlanta Gas Light and increased regulatory infrastructure program revenues at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas. The decrease in our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. was also unfavorably impacted by increased interest expenses resulting from higher average debt outstanding, primarily the result of the additional long term debt issuance used to fund the Nicor merger. 35 In 2010, our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. increased by $12 million from the prior year primarily due to increased EBIT at distribution operations largely due to new rates at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas as well as the completion of the Hampton Roads project by Virginia Natural Gas. The increase in our net income attributable to AGL Resources Inc. was also favorably impacted by increased EBIT at wholesale services and our additional 15% ownership interest in SouthStar, which was effective January 1, 2010. This was partly offset by increased interest expense and decreased EBIT at retail operations, midstream operations and other. The decrease in EBIT at retail operations was mainly attributable to increased operating expenses. The variances for each operating segment are contained within the year over year 2011 compared to year over year discussion on the following pages. Interest expense In 2011, our interest expense increased by approximately $27 million. This increase was primarily the result of our prefunding the cash portion of the merger consideration through the issuance of approximately $975 million of long term debt during the year. This increased our annual interest expense by approximately $17 million. The remaining increase during 2011 related primarily to fees paid on our Term Loan Facility and our Bridge Facility. The increase in our interest expenses of $8 million in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of fluctuations in short term interest rates and higher average debt levels. The following table provides additional detail on interest expense for the last three years and the primary items that affect year over year change. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Interest expenses $ 136 $ 109 $ 101 Average debt outstanding (1) $ 2,652 $ 2,393 $ 2,239 Average rate (2) 5.1 % 4.6 % 4.5 % (1) Daily average of all outstanding debt. (2) Increase in the 2011 average interest rate is due to our senior note issuances during the current year. Income tax expense Our income tax expense in 2011 decreased by $15 million or 11% compared to 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower consolidated earnings as previously discussed. Our effective tax rate was 42.1% in 2011, 37.5% in 2010 and 37.8% in 2009. The increased effective tax rate in 2011 was primarily due to non deductible merger transaction expenses. Our income tax expense in 2010 increased by $5 million or 4% compared to 2009 primarily due to higher consolidated earnings. As a result of the authoritative guidance related to consolidations, income tax expense and our effective tax rate are determined from earnings before income taxes less net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest. For more information on our income taxes, including a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Operating metrics Selected weather, customer and volume metrics for 2011, 2010 and 2009, which we consider to be some of the key performance indicators for our operating segments, are presented in the following tables. For the businesses that were acquired from the Nicor merger we only include the 22 days of activity from December 10, 2011 through December 31, 2011. We measure the effects of weather on our business through heating degree days. Generally, increased heating degree days result in greater demand for gas on our distribution systems. However, extended and unusually mild weather during the Heating Season can have a significant negative impact on demand for natural gas. Our customer metrics highlight the average number of customers to which we provide services. This number of customers can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions and competition from alternative fuels. Volume metrics for distribution operations and retail operations present the effects of weather and our customers demand for natural gas. Wholesale services daily physical sales represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers. Within our midstream operations segment, our natural gas storage businesses seek to have a significant percentage of their working natural gas capacity under firm subscription, but also take into account current and expected market conditions. This allows our natural gas storage business to generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, but retain some consistency with their earnings and maximize the value of the investments. 36 Weather 2011 vs. 2010 vs. 2011 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 vs. Heating degree days (1) Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 normal normal normal Normal 2011 2010 2009 colder (warmer) colder (warmer) colder (warmer) colder (warmer) colder (warmer) Georgia 2,679 2,454 3,209 2,803 (24 )% 14 % (8 )% 20 % 5 % Virginia 3,182 2,945 3,601 3,312 (18 )% 9 % (7 )% 13 % 4 % New Jersey 4,639 4,275 4,445 4,755 (4 )% (7 )% (8 )% (4 )% 3 % Florida 551 310 1,108 548 (72 )% 102 % (44 )% 101 % (1 )% Tennessee 3,085 2,953 3,594 3,154 (18 )% 14 % (4 )% 16 % 2 % Maryland 4,696 4,489 4,679 4,783 (4 )% (2 )% (4 )% 0 % 2 % Ohio 4,898 4,656 5,181 4,919 (10 )% 5 % (5 )% 6 % 0 % 2011 vs. 2010 vs. 2011 vs. 2010 vs. 2009 vs. Quarter ended December 31, 2010 2009 normal normal normal Normal 2011 2010 2009 colder (warmer) colder (warmer) colder (warmer) colder (warmer) colder (warmer) Georgia 1,036 852 1,187 1,182 (28 )% 0 % (18 )% 15 % 14 % Virginia 1,091 853 1,380 1,065 (38 )% 30 % (22 )% 26 % (2 )% New Jersey 1,620 1,328 1,720 1,618 (23 )% 6 % (18 )% 6 % 0 % Florida 174 66 365 158 (82 )% 131 % (62 )% 110 % (9 )% Tennessee 1,216 1,104 1,382 1,283 (20 )% 8 % (9 )% 14 % 6 % Maryland 1,673 1,463 1,822 1,665 (20 )% 9 % (13 )% 9 % 0 % Ohio 1,828 1,563 2,028 1,893 (23 )% 7 % (14 )% 11 % 1 % Customers (average end use in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 2011 2010 2009 % change % change Distribution Operations Nicor Gas (2) 2,188 n/a n/a n/a % n/a % Atlanta Gas Light 1,541 1,544 1,549 (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Virginia Natural Gas 278 275 273 1.1 0.7 Elizabethtown Gas 276 274 273 0.7 0.4 Florida City Gas 103 103 103 0.0 0.0 Chattanooga Gas 62 62 62 0.0 0.0 Elkton Gas 6 6 6 0.0 0.0 Total 4,454 2,264 2,266 n/a % (0.1 )% Retail Operations Georgia 485 496 504 (2 )% (2 )% Ohio and Florida (3) 96 77 103 25 % (25 )% Total 581 573 607 1 % (6 )% Market share in Georgia 33 % 33 % 33 % 0 % 0 % Volumes In billion cubic feet (Bcf) Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 2011 2010 2009 % change % change Distribution Operations (4) Firm 247 243 218 2 % 11 % Interruptible 105 99 98 6 % 1 % Total 352 342 316 3 % 8 % Retail Operations Georgia firm 35 46 40 (24 )% 15 % Ohio and Florida 9 10 11 (10 )% (9 )% Wholesale Services Daily physical sales (Bcf / day) (4) 5.21 4.57 2.96 14 % 54 % As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Midstream Operations Working natural gas capacity 13.5 13.5 7.5 % of capacity under subscription (5) 68 % 51 % 67 % (1) Obtained from weather stations relevant to our service areas at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center.

Please note that our segments have changed as a result of our merger with Nicor and amounts from the periods presented have been reclassified between the segments to reflect these changes. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional segment information. (2) The increase in operating expenses for 2011 is primarily due to $68 million in transaction expenses associated with the merger with Nicor. For more information see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Additionally, includes intercompany eliminations. (3) Operating margin and expense for 2011 are adjusted for revenue tax expense for Nicor Gas which is passed directly through to customers. Distribution Operations Our distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the seven states we serve. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation, interest, maintenance and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders. With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, our second largest utility, the earnings of our regulated utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas and general economic conditions that may impact our customers ability to pay for gas consumed. We have various mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms, at all of our utilities, with the exception of Nicor Gas, that limit our exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in all of our utilities respective service areas.

Our wholesale services segment also incurred credit losses of $4 million during 2011 associated with a counterparty that filed for bankruptcy during the early part of the third quarter. Natural gas shale production in the Northeast, specifically from the Marcellus region, resulted in pipeline capacity constraints. During the second half of 2011, our wholesale services segment experienced constraints for natural gas purchased from producers in the Marcellus shale gas producing region, resulting in the sale of natural gas at a loss, higher transportation costs and the costs to renegotiate certain of Sequents producer contracts. Total losses related to these constraints during 2011 were approximately $18 million. 39 Change in storage and transportation hedges Seasonal (storage) and geographical location (transportation) spreads continue to be significantly lower than in 2010 and overall natural gas price volatility remained low during the second half of 2011. Gains in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to significantly larger seasonal and geographical location spreads at the time the hedges of our storage and transportation positions were executed and the subsequent downward movement of natural gas prices and collapse of regional transportation spreads during 2011 and 2010. The following table indicates the components of wholesale services operating margin for the periods presented. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Commercial activity recognized $ 32 $ 77 $ 67 Gain on transportation hedges 14 1 43 Gain on storage hedges 37 29 1 Inventory LOCOM adjustment, net of estimated current period recoveries (26 ) (2 ) 0 Operating margin $ 57 $ 105 $ 111 For more information on Sequents expected operating revenues from its storage inventory in 2012 and discussion of commercial activity, see description of the inventory roll out schedule in Item 1 Business. Midstream Operations Our midstream operations segments primary activity is our natural gas storage business, which develops, acquires and operates high deliverability underground natural gas storage assets. While this business can also generate additional revenue during times of peak market demand for natural gas storage services, the majority of our storage services are covered under medium to long term contracts at a fixed market rate. For more information on our operating segments, see Item 1, Business.

Such shipments consist primarily of southbound cargo such as building materials, food and other necessities for developers, distributors and residents in the region, as well as tourist related shipments intended for use in hotels and resorts, and on cruise ships. The balance of the cargo consists primarily of interisland shipments of consumer staples and northbound shipments of apparel, rum and agricultural products. Other related services such as inland transportation and cargo insurance are also provided within the cargo shipping segment. Our cargo shipping segment also includes an equity investment in Triton, a cargo container leasing business. Triton is a full service global leasing company and an owner lessor of marine intermodal cargo containers. Profits and losses are generally allocated to investors capital accounts in proportion to their capital contributions. Our investment in Triton is accounted for under the equity method, and our share of earnings is reported within Other Income on our Consolidated Statements of Income. For more information about our investment in Triton, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. The cargo shipping business reported an immaterial EBIT for the 22 days following the close of our merger with Nicor for the period ending December 31, 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview The acquisition of natural gas and pipeline capacity, payment of dividends, and working capital requirements are our most significant short term financing requirements. The need for long term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long term debt. The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is primarily provided by our operating activities. Our short term cash requirements not met by cash from operations are primarily satisfied with short term borrowings under our commercial paper programs, which are supported by the AGL Credit Facility and the Nicor Gas Credit Facility. Periodically, we raise funds supporting our long term cash needs from the issuance of long term debt or equity securities. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short term and long term needs in a cost effective manner. 40 Our capital market strategy has continued to focus on maintaining strong Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, ensuring ample cash resources and daily liquidity, accessing capital markets at favorable times as necessary, managing critical business risks and maintaining a balanced capital structure through the appropriate issuance of equity or long term debt securities. Our issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt and equity, is subject to customary approval or review by state and federal regulatory bodies including the various commissions of the states in which we conduct business, the SEC and the FERC. Furthermore, a substantial portion of our consolidated assets, earnings and cash flow are derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries, whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation. Nicor Gas is restricted by regulation in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. Dividends to AGL Resources are allowed only to the extent of Nicor Gas retained earnings balance, which was $465 million at December 31, 2011. We believe the amounts available to us under our senior notes, AGL Credit Facility and Nicor Gas Credit Facility, through the issuance of debt and equity securities, combined with cash provided by operating activities, will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, pension contributions, construction expenditures, anticipated debt redemptions, interest payments on debt obligations, dividend payments, common share repurchases and other cash needs through the next several years. Our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and our debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which we are unable to control. These factors include, among others, regulatory changes, the price of and demand for natural gas and operational risks. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $71 million of cash and short and long term investments on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that were generated from Tropical Shipping. This cash and the investments are not available for use by our other operations, and if we repatriate all or a portion of Tropical Shippings earnings in the form of a dividend we would be subject to a significant amount of United States income tax. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our income taxes. We will continue to evaluate our need to increase available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements, including the impact of changes in natural gas prices, liquidity requirements established by rating agencies and other factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information on items that could impact our liquidity and capital resource requirements. Merger Financing On December 9, 2011, we closed our merger with Nicor at which time each outstanding share of Nicor common stock, other than shares to be cancelled and Dissenting Shares, as defined in the Merger Agreement, was converted into the right to receive consideration of (i) 0.8382 of a share of AGL Resources common stock and (ii) $21.20 in cash. Fractional shares were paid in cash as were stock options and restricted stock units that were awarded to Nicor employees for pre merger services. The total value of the consideration paid to Nicor common shareholders was approximately $2.5 billion based primarily upon the volume weighted average price of AGL Resources common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December 8, 2011, and the number of Nicor common shares outstanding as of the Effective Date, as defined in the Merger Agreement. Upon closing the merger, we assumed all of Nicors outstanding debt, the fair value of which was approximately $1.0 billion. During 2011, we secured the permanent debt financing we used to pay the cash portion of the purchase consideration. This included approximately $200 million from our $500 million in senior notes that were issued in March 2011, $500 million in senior notes that were issued in September 2011, and $275 million in senior unsecured notes that were issued in the private placement market in October 2011. As a result of the merger with Nicor, we assumed the first mortgage bonds of Nicor Gas, which at December 31, 2011 had principal balances totaling $500 million and maturity dates between 2016 and 2038. These bonds were recorded at their estimated fair value of $599 million on the date the merger closed. Additionally, we assumed $424 million in short term debt upon closing the merger. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and our ability to obtain adequate and cost effective financing are directly impacted by our credit ratings as well as the availability of financial markets. In addition, credit ratings are important to our counterparties when we engage in certain transactions including over the counter derivatives. It is our long term objective to maintain or improve our credit ratings in order to manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and may periodically change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of other ratings. The rating agencies regularly review our performance, prospects and financial condition and reevaluate their ratings of our long term debt and short term borrowings, our corporate ratings, including our ratings outlook. There is no guarantee that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Factors we consider important in assessing our credit ratings include our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position leverage, capital spending, earnings, cash flow generation, available liquidity and overall business risks. We do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any agreements that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2011. 41 AGL Resources Nicor Gas S&P Moodys Fitch S&P Moodys Fitch Corporate rating BBB+ n/a A BBB+ n/a A Commercial paper A 2 P 2 F2 A 2 P 2 F 1 Senior unsecured BBB+ Baa1 A BBB+ A3 A+ Senior secured n/a n/a n/a A A1 AA Ratings outlook Stable Stable Stable Stable Stable Stable In December 2011, subsequent to the completion of our merger with Nicor, all three of the rating agencies reassessed their credit ratings for the post merger company and its subsidiaries and noted the outlook is now stable. Fitch affirmed its ratings for both AGL Resources and Nicor Gas. S&P downgraded the corporate credit rating of AGL Resources from A to BBB+ while downgrading the corporate credit rating of Nicor Gas from AA to BBB+. Moodys affirmed the senior unsecured and short term ratings of the legacy subsidiaries of AGL Resources while downgrading the senior unsecured rating of Nicor Gas from A2 to A3 and the commercial paper rating of Nicor Gas from P 1 to P 2. The primary reason for the downgrade for AGL Resources was the increased financial leverage resulting from the merger and the resulting weakening of our consolidated credit metrics. The downgrade of Nicor Gas was primarily an attempt to conform the Nicor Gas credit ratings to those of the subsidiaries of AGL Resources. These credit rating changes are not expected to materially impact our borrowing costs. It is expected that long term rating stability will depend on a reduction in leverage through successful merger integration and the realization of operating synergies. Our credit ratings depend largely on our financial performance, and a downgrade in our current ratings, particularly below investment grade, would increase our borrowing costs and could limit our access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. Default Provisions Our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions. Our credit facilities contain customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay any interest or principal when due, the failure to furnish financial statements within the timeframe established by each debt facility, the failure to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, cross defaults to certain other material indebtedness in excess of specified amounts, incorrect or misleading representations or warranties, insolvency or bankruptcy, fundamental change of control, the occurrence of certain Employee Retirement Income Security Act events, judgments in excess of specified amounts and certain impairments to the guarantee. Our credit facilities contain certain non financial covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, loans and investments, acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, asset dispositions, mergers and consolidations, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Our credit facilities also includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 70% at the end of any fiscal month. This ratio, as defined within our debt agreements, includes standby letters of credit, performance/surety bonds and the exclusion of other comprehensive income pension adjustments. Adjusting for these items, the following table contains our debt to capitalization ratios for the periods presented, which are within our required and targeted ranges. AGL Resources Nicor Gas December 31, December 31, 2011 2010 2011 Debt to capitalization ratio 58 % 58 % 60 % We were in compliance with all of our debt provisions and covenants, both financial and non financial, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization, on a consolidated basis, is typically greater at the beginning of the Heating Season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund our natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to maintain our ratio of total debt to total capitalization in a target range of 50% to 60%. Accomplishing this capital structure objective and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings. For more information on our default provisions see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. The components of our capital structure, as calculated from our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, as of the dates indicated, are provided in the following table. 42 December 31, 2011 2010 Short term debt 16 % 23 % Long term debt 43 37 Total debt 59 60 Equity 41 40 Total capitalization 100 % 100 % Cash Flows The following table provides a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the last three years. In millions 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 451 $ 526 $ 592 Investing activities (1,339 ) (442 ) (476 ) Financing activities 933 (86 ) (106 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 45 (2 ) 10 Cash and cash equivalent at beginning of period 24 26 16 Cash and cash equivalent at end of period $ 69 $ 24 $ 26 Cash Flow from Operating Activities We prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows using the indirect method. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period. These reconciling items include depreciation and amortization, changes in derivative instrument assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes and changes in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period. Year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily due to working capital changes within our distribution operations, retail operations and wholesale services segments resulting from the impact of weather, the price of natural gas, natural gas storage, the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries. The increase or decrease in the price of natural gas directly impacts the cost of gas stored in inventory. 2011 compared to 2010 In 2011, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $451 million, a decrease of $75 million or 14% from 2010. This decrease was primarily a result of merger related expenses in 2011 of $68 million and the payment of $22 million of Nicor deferred compensation plans and $12 million of Nicor financial advisor fees. Our gas and trade payables required $58 million more of cash compared to 2010, primarily related to our subsidiaries acquired as part of the Nicor merger. Additionally, we had a $69 million decrease in operating cash flow from loaned gas activities associated with park and loan gas transactions in part due to fewer opportunities resulting from a weakening of storage price differentials. These decreases in our cash flow from operating activities were partially offset by $125 million increase in cash received from inventories. The $158 million is primarily due to Nicor Gas net inventory withdrawals of $89 million in the period after merger closing through December 31, 2011 and by overall lower average cost of gas inventory and lower volumes of gas inventory for our other subsidiaries. 2010 compared to 2009 In 2010, our net cash flow provided from operating activities was $526 million, a decrease of $66 million, or 11%, from 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to 2009 within most of our service areas. As a result, the use of working capital for our gas receivables increased $134 million due to increased volumes sold to our customers. We also refunded an additional $38 million to our utility customers for billed commodity costs compared to 2009 as natural gas commodity cost recovery rates charged to customers were reduced as under recovered amounts were collected in part due to the decline in natural gas prices. This increased use of operating cash flow was mostly offset by decreased working capital used by Sequent of $128 million for its energy marketing activities, resulting from the timing of payments for gas purchases relative to collections of accounts receivable and an increase in Sequents daily physical sales. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of our $912 million payment for the cash portion of the purchase consideration, net of cash that was acquired in the Nicor merger. Additionally, we incurred PP&E expenditures, the majority of which were within our distribution operations and midstream operations segments. Our estimated PP&E expenditures for 2012 and our actual PP&E expenditures incurred in 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown within the following categories and are presented in the table below. 43 Distribution business primarily includes new construction and infrastructure improvements Regulatory infrastructure programs programs that update or expand our distribution systems and liquefied natural gas facilities to improve system reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. These programs include the pipeline replacement program and STRIDE at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas utility infrastructure enhancements program Pipeline projects projects include (i) Hampton Roads, a Virginia Natural Gas pipeline project, which connects its northern and southern systems and (ii) Magnolia Pipeline, which diversifies our sources of natural gas by connecting our Georgia service territory to the Elba Island LNG terminal Natural gas storage additional underground natural gas storage at Golden Triangle Storage, Jefferson Island and Central Valley Other primarily includes cargo shipping, information technology and building and leasehold improvements In millions 2012 (1) 2011 (2) 2010 2009 Distribution business $ 376 $ 159 $ 159 $ 132 Regulatory infrastructure programs 286 192 186 76 Pipeline projects 0 0 3 136 Natural gas storage 66 22 114 95 Other 81 54 48 37 Total $ 809 $ 427 $ 510 $ 476 (1) Estimated PP&E expenditures. (2) Only includes Nicor expenditures subsequent to the merger date of December 9, 2011. Our PP&E expenditures were $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $510 million for the same period in 2010. This decrease of $83 million, or 16%, was primarily due to a $98 million decrease in expenditures for the construction of the Golden Triangle Storage natural gas storage facility due to completion of base infrastructure spending and completion of the first cavern. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $13 million at Nicor Gas and $6 million at Central Valley that were incurred subsequent to merger closing. Our PP&E expenditures were $510 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $476 million for the same period in 2009. This increase of $34 million, or 7%, was primarily due to a $19 million increase in expenditures for the construction of the Golden Triangle Storage natural gas storage facility, $26 million in expenditures for Elizabethtown Gas utility infrastructure enhancements program, $84 million in expenditures for STRIDE and $38 million in other capital projects in distribution operations. This was offset by reduced expenditures of $133 million for the Hampton Roads and Magnolia projects, for which construction was substantially completed in 2009. The higher capital expenditures were further offset by $73 million in proceeds from the disposition of assets. Our estimated expenditures for 2012 include discretionary spending for capital projects principally within the distribution business, regulatory infrastructure programs and other categories. We continually evaluate whether to proceed with these projects, reviewing them in relation to factors including our authorized returns on rate base, other returns on invested capital for projects of a similar nature, capital structure and credit ratings, among others. We will make adjustments to these discretionary expenditures as necessary based upon these factors. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of equity and debt securities. This strategy includes active management of the percentage of total debt relative to total capitalization, appropriate mix of debt with fixed to floating interest rates (our variable debt target is 20% to 45% of total debt), as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities. On May 4, 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $250 million to effectively convert a portion of our $300 million 6.4% fixed rate senior notes that mature July 2016 to a variable rate obligation. As of December 31, 2011, we also held forward starting interest rate swaps totaling $90 million that were redesignated as cash flow hedges upon the close of the merger. Under the terms of the swaps, we agree to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2011, our variable rate debt was $1.7 billion, or 36%, of our total debt, compared to $892 million, or 33%, as of December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily due to increased commercial paper borrowings as of year end and the $250 million interest rate swaps, both of which increased our ratio of variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2011, our commercial paper borrowings of $1.3 billion were 80% higher than the same time last year, primarily a result of the additional short term debt that we assumed from the Nicor merger and higher working capital requirements. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Our cash provided by financing activities was $933 million in 2011 compared to cash used of $86 million in 2010. The increase in net cash flow provided by financing activities of $1.0 billion was primarily due to our $1.3 billion of long term debt issued, discussed below, and increased commercial paper borrowings of $91 million in 2011 compared to 2010. This was partially offset by payment for a senior note maturity of $300 million, decreased distribution to the noncontrolling interest of $11 million and increased dividends paid on common shares of $15 million. 44 Short term Debt Our short term debt as of December 31, 2011 was comprised of borrowings under our commercial paper programs and current portions of our senior notes and capital leases. In millions Year end balance outstanding (1) Daily average balance outstanding (2) Minimum balance outstanding (2) Largest balance outstanding (2) Commercial paper AGL Capital (3) (4) $ 869 $ 324 $ 0 $ 1,179 Commercial paper Nicor Gas (5) 452 456 410 514 Senior notes 15 20 0 300 Capital leases 2 2 2 2 Term loan facility (3) 0 12 0 150 Total short term debt $ 1,338 $ 814 $ 412 $ 2,145 (1) As of December 31, 2011. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2011, with the exception of the Nicor Gas commercial paper program, which is for the period December 10, 2011 December 31, 2011. The minimum and largest balances outstanding for each short term debt instrument occurred at different times during the year and thus the total balances are not indicative of actual borrowings on any one day during the year. (3) During 2011, our short term debt balances were impacted by our $300 million senior notes, which matured in January 2011. These senior notes were initially repaid with a $150 million funding under our Term Loan Facility and borrowings under our AGL Capital commercial paper program. In February 2011, the Term Loan Facility was repaid through additional AGL Capital commercial paper borrowings at which time the Term Loan Facility expired. (4) During 2011, we completed $1,275 million in senior note offerings to repay our maturing long term debt of $300 million and for the approximate $980 million in cash payments made for the Nicor merger consideration. Prior to the closing of the merger, a portion of the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding AGL Capital commercial paper. (5) We assumed approximately $424 million in commercial paper borrowings as of the closing of the Nicor merger. The largest, minimum and daily average balances borrowed under our commercial paper programs are important when assessing the intra period fluctuation of our short term borrowings and potential liquidity risk. Our year end short term debt outstanding and our largest short term debt balance outstanding were significantly higher than our average short term debt outstanding during 2011 due to our seasonal cash requirements. Such cash requirements generally increase between June and December as we purchase natural gas in advance of the Heating Season. The timing differences of when we pay our suppliers for natural gas purchases and when we recover our costs from our customers through their monthly bills can significantly affect our cash requirements. Our short term debt balances are typically reduced during the Heating Season as a significant portion of our current assets, primarily natural gas inventories, are converted into cash. Additionally, increasing natural gas commodity prices can have a significant impact on our commercial paper borrowings. Based on current natural gas prices and our expected injection plan, a $1 increase or decrease per thousand cubic feet of natural gas could result in a $200 million change of working capital requirements during the peak of the Heating Season. This range is sensitive to the timing of storage injections and withdrawals, collateral requirements and our portfolio position. On November 10, 2011, the existing AGL Credit Facility was amended to increase the available principal to $1.3 billion in support of the AGL Capital commercial paper program. On December 15, 2011, Nicor Gas entered into a $700 million revolving credit facility to support the Nicor Gas commercial paper program. The AGL Credit Facility and the Nicor Gas Credit Facility can be drawn upon to meet working capital and other general corporate needs. The interest rates payable on borrowings under these facilities are calculated either at the alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin, or LIBOR, plus an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin used in both interest rate calculations will vary according to AGL Capitals and Nicor Gas current credit ratings. At December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under either of these facilities. SouthStars five year $75 million unsecured credit facility expired in November 2011. The timing of natural gas withdrawals is dependent on the weather and natural gas market conditions, both of which impact the price of natural gas. Increasing natural gas commodity prices can have a significant impact on our commercial paper borrowings. Based on current natural gas prices and our expected purchases during the upcoming injection season, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover our working capital needs for the upcoming Heating Season. The lenders under our credit facilities and lines of credit are major financial institutions with approximately $2.2 billion of committed balances and all have investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2011. It is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency. However, based on our current assessment of our lenders creditworthiness, we believe the risk of lender default is minimal. Long term Debt Our long term debt matures more than one year from December 31, 2011, and consisted of medium term notes: Series A, Series B, and Series C, which we issued under an indenture during December 1989, senior notes, first mortgage bonds, gas facility revenue bonds and capital leases. 45 Our long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures, long term debt maturities and decisions to refinance long term debt. The following represents our long term debt activity over the last three years. Issuance Date Amount (in millions) Term (in years) Interest rate Senior notes (1) March 2011 $ 500 30 5.9 % Senior notes (2) September 2011 $ 200 30 5.9 % Senior notes (2) September 2011 $ 300 10 3.5 % Senior notes Series A (2) October 2011 $ 120 5 1.9 % Senior notes Series B (2) October 2011 $ 155 7 3.5 % Gas facility revenue bonds (3) October 2010 $ 160 11 21 reset daily Senior notes (4) August 2009 $ 300 10 5.25 % (1) The net proceeds were used to repay our commercial paper and to repay our $300 million in senior notes that matured on January 14, 2011. The remaining proceeds were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration and expenses incurred in connection with the Nicor merger. (2) The net proceeds were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration and expenses incurred in connection with the Nicor merger. (3) We entered into new agreements with remarketing agents to resell the bonds to investors, and established new letters of credit to provide credit enhancement to the bonds. (4) The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our commercial paper. Noncontrolling Interest We recorded cash distributions for SouthStars dividend distributions to Piedmont of $16 million in 2011, $27 million in 2010 and $20 million in 2009 in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as financing activities. The primary reason for the reduction in the distribution to Piedmont during the current year is due to our increased ownership percentage in SouthStar in 2010. The 2010 distribution was paid on 2009 earnings. Dividends on Common Stock Our common stock dividend payments were $148 million in 2011, $133 million in 2010 and $127 million in 2009. The increases were generally the result of annual dividend increases of $0.04 per share for each of the last three years. However, as a result of the Nicor merger, AGL Resources shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 8, 2011, received a pro rata dividend of $0.0989 per share for the stub period, accruing from November 19, 2011 totaling $7 million. For information about restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. In addition, in conjunction with the Nicor merger we issued 38.2 million shares of AGL Resources common stock, which is the same class as our previously issued common stock and receives dividends at the same rate as the shares issued prior to the merger. Our common stock outstanding totaled approximately 117.0 million shares at December 31, 2011. Treasury Shares In February 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to purchase up to 8 million shares of our outstanding common stock over a five year period. These purchases are intended principally to offset share issuances under our employee and non employee director incentive compensation plans and our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. Stock purchases under this program may be made in the open market or in private transactions at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of common shares that we will purchase, and we can terminate or limit the program at any time. This program expired in January 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we purchased 65,250 shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost of $36.25 per common share and an aggregate cost of $2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not purchase shares of our common stock. We currently anticipate holding the purchased shares as treasury shares. For more information on our common share repurchases see Item 5 Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Shelf Registration On August 17, 2010, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC, which expires in 2013. Debt securities and related guarantees issued under the shelf registration will be issued by AGL Capital under an indenture dated as of February 20, 2001, as supplemented and modified, as necessary, among AGL Capital, AGL Resources and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The indenture provides for the issuance from time to time of debt securities in an unlimited dollar amount and an unlimited number of series, subject to our AGL Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility financial covenants related to total debt to total capitalization. The debt securities will be guaranteed by AGL Resources. On February 25, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a shelf registration with a capacity of $225 million with the SEC, which expires in March, 2012. First mortgage bonds issued under the shelf registration will be issued by Nicor Gas under an indenture dated as of January 1, 1954, as supplemented and modified, as necessary, among Northern Illinois Gas Company doing business as Nicor Gas Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. At December 31, 2011, Nicor Gas had the capacity to issue approximately $480 million of additional first mortgage bonds under the terms of its indenture. 46 Off balance sheet arrangements We have certain guarantees, as further described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. We believe the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. The following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligation payments such as debt and lease agreements, and commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2011. 2017 & In millions Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt (1) $ 3,431 $ 0 $ 225 $ 0 $ 200 $ 545 $ 2,461 Short term debt (2) 1,338 1,338 0 0 0 0 0 Pipeline replacement program costs (3) 276 131 145 0 0 0 0 Environmental remediation liabilities (3) 327 37 66 55 45 32 92 Total $ 5,372 $ 1,506 $ 436 $ 55 $ 245 $ 577 $ 2,553 Unrecorded contractual obligations and commitments (4) (9) (10): Pipeline charges, storage capacity and gas supply (5) $ 2,263 $ 781 $ 494 $ 269 $ 164 $ 85 $ 470 Interest charges (6) 2,581 169 161 158 149 137 1,807 Operating leases (7) 220 32 25 20 19 18 106 Asset management agreements (8) 26 11 9 3 2 1 0 Standby letters of credit, performance / surety bonds (9) 22 18 4 0 0 0 0 Other 14 5 3 2 2 2 0 Total $ 5,126 $ 1,016 $ 696 $ 452 $ 336 $ 243 $ 2,383 (1) Excludes the $99 million step up to fair value of first mortgage bonds, $18 million unamortized debt premium and $13 million interest rate swaps fair value adjustment. (2) Includes current portion of long term debt of $15 million which matures in June 2012. (3) Includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms. (4) In accordance with GAAP, these items are not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. (5) Includes charges recoverable through a natural gas cost recovery mechanism or alternatively billed to Marketers and demand charges associated with Sequent. The gas supply amount includes amounts for Nicor Gas and SouthStar gas commodity purchase commitments of 67 Bcf at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices as of December 31, 2011, and is valued at $222 million. As we do for other subsidiaries, we provide guarantees to certain gas suppliers for SouthStar in support of payment obligations. (6) Floating rate interest charges are calculated based on the interest rate as of December 31, 2011 and the maturity date of the underlying debt instrument. As of December 31, 2011, we have $61 million of accrued interest on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that will be paid in 2012. (7) We have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions. We account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the respective minimum lease terms, in accordance with authoritative guidance related to leases. Our operating leases are primarily for real estate. (8) Represent fixed fee minimum payments for Sequents affiliated asset management agreements. (9) We provide guarantees to certain municipalities and other agencies and certain gas suppliers of SouthStar in support of payment obligations. (10) Based on the current funding status of the plans, we would be required to make a minimum contribution to our pension plans of approximately $36 million in 2012. We may make additional contributions in 2012. 47 Substitute natural gas In 2011, Illinois enacted laws that required Nicor Gas and other large gas utilities in Illinois to elect to either file rate cases with the Illinois Commission in 2012, 2014 and 2016 or sign contracts to purchase SNG to be produced from two coal gasification plants proposed to be constructed in Illinois. On September 30, 2011, Nicor Gas signed an agreement to purchase approximately 25 Bcf of SNG annually from one of the proposed facilities for a 10 year term beginning as early as 2015. The price of the SNG under this contract could potentially be significantly more than market price. The counterparty has announced plans to construct a 60 Bcf per year coal gasification plant in southern Illinois. On October 11, 2011, the IPA approved the form of a draft 30 year contract for the purchase by us of approximately 20 Bcf per year of SNG from the second proposed plant beginning as early as 2018. In November 2011, Nicor Gas filed a lawsuit against the IPA and the developer of this second proposed plant contending that the draft contract approved by the IPA does not conform to certain requirements of the enabling legislation. The lawsuit is pending in circuit court in DuPage County, Illinois. In accordance with the enabling legislation, the draft contract approved by the IPA for the second proposed plant was submitted to the Illinois Commission for further approvals by that regulatory body. The Illinois Commission issued an order on January 10, 2012 approving a final form of contract for the second plant. The final form of contract approved by the Illinois Commission modified the draft contract submitted by the IPA in various respects. Both we and the developer of the plant have filed applications for rehearing with the Illinois Commission seeking changes to the final form of contract it approved. The price of the SNG that may be produced from both of the coal gasification plants may significantly exceed market prices and is dependent upon a variety of factors, including plant construction costs, and is currently not estimable. Illinois laws provided that prices paid for SNG purchase from the plants are to be considered prudent and not subject to review or disallowance by the Illinois Commission. For additional information regarding the SNG plant legislation see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Standby letters of credit and performance / surety bonds. We also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business. Contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur, such as financial guarantees, and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor. We would expect to fund these contingent financial commitments with operating and financing cash flows. Pension and other retirement obligations. Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Pension Protection Act. Additionally, we calculate any required pension contributions using the traditional unit credit cost method. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. The contributions represent the portion of the other retirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. The state regulatory commissions in all of our jurisdictions, except Illinois, have phase ins that defer a portion of the retirement benefit expenses for retirement plans other than pensions for future recovery. We recorded a regulatory asset for these future recoveries of $291 million as of December 31, 2011 and $9 million as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we recorded a regulatory liability of $19 million as of December 31, 2011 and $6 million as of December 31, 2010 for our expected expenses under the AGL Postretirement Plan. In Illinois, all accrued retirement plan expenses are recovered through base rates. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information about our pension and other retirement plans. In 2011, we contributed $56 million to our qualified pension plans. In 2010, we contributed $31 million to these qualified pension plans. Based on the current funding status of these plans, we would be required to make a minimum contribution to the plans of approximately $36 million in 2012. We may make additional contributions in 2012 in order to preserve the current level of benefits under these plans and in accordance with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those judgments and estimates have a significant effect on our financial statements because they result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We frequently re evaluate our judgments and estimates that are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein, the following policies represent those that may involve a higher degree of uncertainty, judgment and complexity; these include Regulatory Infrastructure Program Liabilities, Environmental Remediation Liabilities, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Contingencies, Pension and Other Retirement Plans and Income Taxes. 48 Regulatory Infrastructure Program Liabilities We record regulatory assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in accordance with authoritative guidance related to regulated entities. We record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery is probable through either rate riders or base rates specifically authorized by a state regulatory commission. We record regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the rate making process. By order of the Georgia Commission, our wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light began a pipeline replacement program to replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system by December 2013. The order provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program, which Atlanta Gas Light has recorded as a regulatory asset. Atlanta Gas Light will recover from end use customers, through billings to Marketers, the costs related to the program net of any cost savings from the program. All such amounts will be recovered through a combination of straight fixed variable rates and a pipeline replacement revenue rider. The regulatory asset has two components (i) the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders, and (ii) the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders. The determination of future expected costs associated with our pipeline replacement program liabilities involves judgment. To the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are adjusted accordingly. Factors that must be considered in estimating the future expected costs are: projected capital expenditure spending, including labor and material costs the remaining pipeline footage to be replaced for remainder of the program changes in the regulatory environment or our completive position passage of new legislation changes in accounting guidance We recorded a long term liability of $145 million as of December 31, 2011 and $166 million as of December 31, 2010, which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the pipeline replacement program. As of December 31, 2011, we had recorded a current liability of $131 million, representing expected pipeline replacement program expenditures for the next 12 months. We report these estimates on an undiscounted basis. If Atlanta Gas Lights pipeline replacement program expenditures, subject to future recovery, were $10 million higher or lower its incremental expected annual revenues would have changed by approximately $1 million. Details of our regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Environmental Remediation Liabilities We are subject to legislation and regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters. Additionally, we owned and operated a number of MGP sites at which hazardous substances may be present. In accordance with GAAP, we have established reserves for environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated. We historically reported estimates of future environmental remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs. We presently report estimates of future remediation costs on an undiscounted basis. These estimates contain various engineering uncertainties, and we continuously attempt to refine these estimates. However, we have not yet performed these probabilistic models for all of our sites in Illinois, which will be completed in 2012. In Georgia and Florida, we have confirmed 14 former MGP sites where Atlanta Gas Light, or its predecessors, owned or operated all or part of these sites. Atlanta Gas Lights environmental remediation liability is included in its corresponding regulatory asset. Our recovery of these environmental remediation costs is subject to review by the Georgia Commission, which may seek to disallow the recovery of some expenses. We have identified 26 sites in Illinois for which we may have some responsibility. Most of these sites are not presently owned by us. In accordance with Illinois Commission authorization, we have been recovering, and expect to continue to recover, these costs from our customers, subject to annual prudence reviews. We have identified 6 former operating sites in New Jersey, where Elizabethtown Gas is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The New Jersey BPU has authorized Elizabethtown Gas to recover prudently incurred remediation costs for the New Jersey properties through its remediation adjustment clause. We also own remediation sites in other states. One site, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, is subject to an order by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. There are no cost recovery mechanisms for the environmental remediation sites in North Carolina. 49 We cannot perform precise engineering soil and groundwater cleanup estimates for certain of our former MGP sites. As we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter into cleanup contracts, we are increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of the remediation program and the liabilities may increase as estimates are refined and remediation efforts proceed. The following table provides more information on our former operating sites: In millions Cost estimate range Amount recorded Expected costs over next twelve months Illinois $134 $216 $ 134 $ 19 Georgia and Florida 42 98 58 7 New Jersey 124 174 124 9 North Carolina 10 16 11 2 Total $310 $504 $ 327 $ 37 (1) Our ERC liabilities are customarily reported estimates of future remediation costs for our former operating sites that are contaminated based on probabilistic models of potential costs and on an undiscounted basis. However, we have not yet performed these probabilistic models for all of our sites in Illinois, which will be completed in 2012. In accordance with GAAP we have recorded the lower end of the range. Beyond 2012, these costs cannot be estimated and considerable variability remains in available estimates. Details of our environmental remediation costs are discussed in Note 2 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Derivatives and Hedging Activities The authoritative guidance to determine whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in our assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment. The authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging requires that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the Statements of Financial Position as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. However, if the derivative transaction qualifies for and is designated as a normal purchase and normal sale, it is exempted from the fair value accounting treatment and is subject to traditional accrual accounting. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique. The guidance requires that changes in the derivatives fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, the guidance allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or to record the gains and losses in OCI until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, the guidance requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. Nicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas utilize derivative instruments for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory commissions, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. We use derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to our results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments we use to manage exposures arising from changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. Additionally, as required by the authoritative guidance, we are required to classify our derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The determination of the fair value of our derivative instruments incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include: the credit worthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit) events specific to a given counterparty the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities. 50 We have recorded derivative instrument assets of $314 million at December 31, 2011 and $228 million at December 31, 2010. Additionally, we have recorded derivative liabilities of $110 million at December 31, 2011 and $48 million at December 31, 2010. We recorded gains on our Consolidated Statements of Income of $24 million in 2011 and losses of $46 million in 2010 and $15 million in 2009. If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions we use in pricing our derivative assets or liabilities, we may experience a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein and Item 1, Business. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Our goodwill assets increased from $418 million to $1.8 billion and our intangible assets increased from $2 million to $105 million as a result of the Nicor merger. Our intangible assets at December 31, 2010 were $3 million, but tas a result of amortization during 2011 were $2 million as of the date of the Nicor merger. The fair values of intangible assets were assigned to the trade names and customer relationships at Nicors unregulated operations using a combination of the valuation approaches, including cost savings, multi period excess earnings and relief from royalty approaches. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. We test goodwill impairment utilizing a fair value approach at a reporting unit level which generally equates to our operating segments as discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its fair value. Our goodwill impairment analysis for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit is substantially in excess of carrying value, and are not at risk of failing step one of the impairment evaluation. As a result, we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges and do not anticipate taking goodwill impairment charges in the foreseeable future. Goodwill recorded from the Nicor merger totaled $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion was assigned to distribution operations, $124 million to retail operations, $77 million to cargo shipping, $2 million to midstream operations, $2 million to wholesale services and $8 million to other. For additional information see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Intangible assets from the Nicor merger totaled to $103 million, of which $85 million was assigned to retail operations and $18 million to cargo shipping. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, we amortize intangible assets over their useful lives as we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets. These assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators arise. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value is recorded. No impairment has been recognized. Contingencies Our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities, including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables, rate matters, and legal and environmental exposures. We accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance related to contingencies. We base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates can be, and often are, revised either negatively or positively, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure. Changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Our contingencies are further discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Pension and Other Retirement Plans Our pension and other retirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates. We annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other retirement plan costs and liabilities and update them when appropriate. The critical actuarial assumptions used to develop the required estimates for our pension and other retirement plans include the following key factors: 51 assumed discount rates expected return on plan assets the market value of plan assets assumed mortality table assumed health care costs assumed compensation increases assumed rates of retirement assumed rates of termination The discount rate is utilized in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and other retirement obligations and our annual net pension and other retirement costs. When establishing our discount rate, with the assistance of our actuaries, we consider certain market indices, including the Citigroup Pension Liability rate, the Moodys Corporate AA long term bond rate, other high grade bond indices and a single equivalent discount rate, which is derived by applying the appropriate spot rates based on high quality (AA or better) corporate bonds, to the forecasted future cash flows in each year. The expected long term rate of return on assets is used to calculate the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and other retirement plans costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that years annual pension or other retirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or other retirement plan costs. Equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported results. Plan assets for the Nicor Gas pension plan are measured at fair value. For the AGL pension plan, market performance also effects our market related value of plan assets (MRVPA), which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets. The MRVPA recognizes differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology. Gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the MRVPA based on the five year moving weighted average methodology, which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense. In addition, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and amortized into cost when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) or the MRVPA for the AGL pension plan and fair value of the assets for the Nicor Gas pension plan. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. During 2011, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $22 million related to our defined pension and other retirement benefit plans. We estimate that in 2012, we will record net periodic pension and other retirement benefit costs in the range of $54 million to $57 million (net of capitalization), a $32 million to $35 million increase compared to 2011. Approximately $25 million to $27 million (net of capitalization) of the increase relates to the Nicor Gas retirement plans, which were acquired through the merger with Nicor. Accordingly, excluding the impacts of the additional costs from the Nicor Gas retirement plans, we anticipate that our net periodic pension and other retirement benefit costs to increase by $5 million to $7 million. Nicor Gas had recorded $19 million in net periodic benefit costs in 2011 prior to the completion of the merger. In determining our estimated expenses for 2012, our actuarial consultant assumed the following expected return on plan assets and discount rates Pension plans Other retirement plans Discount rate 4.60 % 4.50 % Expected return on plan assets 8.25% 8.50 % 6.8% 8.50 % The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal and retirement rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants. The following table illustrates the effect of changing the critical actuarial assumptions for our pension and other retirement plans while holding all other assumptions constant. In millions Actuarial assumptions Percentage point change in assumption Increase (decrease) in PBO/ APBO Increase (decrease) in cost Expected long term return on plan assets +/ 1 % $ 0 / 0 $ (5) / 5 Discount rate +/ 1 % (161) / 178 (6) / 6 See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our pension and other retirement plans. 52 Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities are estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our income tax returns. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in our judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. We consider, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in our investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. For state income tax and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In addition, we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. We had a $3 million valuation allowance on $204 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized. Our gross long term deferred tax liability totaled $1,646 million at December 31, 2011. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein for additional information on our taxes. We are required to determine whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on our tax return should be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have a liability recorded for payment of interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. Accounting Developments On May 12, 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements. The guidance expands the qualitative and quantitative disclosures for Level 3 significant unobservable inputs, permits the use of premiums and discounts to value an instrument if it is standard practice and limits best use valuation to non financial assets and liabilities. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On June 16, 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to comprehensive income. The guidance eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the Statements of Equity, but instead allows companies to elect to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement (Statements of Comprehensive Income) or in two consecutive statements. This guidance does not change any of the components of net income or other comprehensive income and earnings per share will still be calculated based on net income. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2012, and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On September 15, 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. The guidance provides us with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the normally required two step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to proceed with the quantitative testing. The guidance allows us to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to quantitative testing and resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2012, but early adoption is permitted. We adopted the guidance early and relied upon a qualitative assessment when performing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2011. 53 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to risks associated with natural gas prices, interest rates, credit and fuel prices. Natural gas price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of natural gas. Interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at Atlanta Gas Light in distribution operations and in wholesale services. Our fuel price risk is primarily in cargo shipping, which is partially reduced through fuel surcharges. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by a risk management policy, approved and monitored by our Risk Management Committee (RMC), which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. Our RMC is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with, and adherence to, the terms within these policies, including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels. Our RMC consists of members of senior management who monitor open natural gas price risk positions and other types of risk, corporate exposures, credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities. It is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the RMC to perform its monitoring functions. Natural Gas Price Risk Distribution Operations Our utilities, excluding Atlanta Gas Light, are authorized to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that allow them to adjust their rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and to ensure they recover 100% of the costs incurred in purchasing gas for their customers. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end use customers, it has no natural gas price risk. Nicor Gas and Elizabethtown Gas enter into derivative instruments to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. Retail Operations We routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to mitigate certain natural gas price and weather risk inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and swap agreements. This includes the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. We use these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins. Wholesale Services We routinely use various types of derivative instruments to mitigate certain natural gas price risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts and financial swap agreements. Midstream Operations Central Valley and Golden Triangle Storage use derivative instruments to reduce their exposure to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas that will be purchased in future periods for pad gas, conditioning gas and additional volumes of gas used to de water the cavern (de water gas) during the construction of storage facilities. Pad gas includes volumes of non working natural gas used to maintain the operational integrity of the caverns. Conditioning gas is used to ready a field for use and will be sold in connection with placing the storage facility into service. De water gas is used to remove water from the cavern in anticipation of commercial service and will be sold after completion of de watering. We also use derivative instruments for asset optimization purposes.

Value at risk Our open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management, including the chief risk officer. Because we generally manage physical gas assets and economically protect our positions by hedging in the futures markets, our open exposure is generally immaterial, permitting us to operate within relatively low VaR limits. We employ daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risks of our open positions. Our VaR is determined on a 95% confidence interval and a 1 day holding period. In simple terms, this means that 95% of the time, the risk of loss from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. We actively monitor open commodity positions and the resulting VaR. We also continue to maintain a relatively matched book, where our total buy volume is close to our sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a 1 day holding period, SouthStars portfolio of positions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were less than $0.1 million and Sequent had the following VaRs.

However, these fuel surcharges do not entirely remove our risk in periods of increasing fuel prices and volatility, or increased competition. 55 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows. Our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on $1.7 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point change in market interest rates would have resulted in an increase in pretax interest expense of $17 million on an annualized basis. We have $300 million of 6.4% senior notes due in July 2016. In May 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps related to these senior notes to effectively convert $250 million from a fixed rate to a variable rate obligation. The interest rate resets quarterly based on LIBOR plus 3.9%. As of December 31, 2011, we also held forward starting interest rate swaps totaling $90 million that were redesignated as cash flow hedges upon the close of the merger. Under the terms of the swaps, we agree to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based upon LIBOR. Interest rate swaps help us achieve our desired mix of variable to fixed rate debt (i.e. variable debt target of 20% to 45% of total debt). Any gain or loss on these interest rate swaps are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until settlement, at which point they are amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt. For additional information, see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Credit Risk Distribution Operations Atlanta Gas Light has a concentration of credit risk as it bills eleven certificated and active Marketers in Georgia for its services. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies with the time of the year, with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in Georgia. These retail functions include customer service, billing, collections, and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Lights tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketers highest months estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2011, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for approximately 30% of our consolidated operating margin and 38% of distribution operations operating margin. Several factors are designed to mitigate our risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. We accept credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities. The RMC reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each Marketer. We believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify, manage and report on Atlanta Gas Lights credit risk exposure to Marketers. Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light. Our gas distribution businesses offer options to help customers manage their bills, such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year. Customer credit risk has been substantially mitigated at Nicor Gas by the bad debt rider approved by the Illinois Commission on February 2, 2010, which provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. For Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas, we are allowed to recover the gas portion of bad debt write offs through their gas recovery mechanisms. Nicor Gas faces potential credit risk in connection with its natural gas supply sales and procurement activities to the extent a counterparty defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver at agreed upon terms and conditions. To manage this risk, Nicor Gas maintains credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of its counterparties. In doing so, Nicor Gas seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, limits its exposure to any one counterparty and enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Certain of our derivative instruments contain credit risk related or other contingent features that could increase the payments for collateral we post in the normal course of business when our financial instruments are in net liability positions. As of December 31, 2011 for agreements with such features, our distribution operations derivative instruments with liability fair values totaled approximately $52 million for which we had posted $17 million of collateral to our counterparties. If it was assumed that we had to post the maximum contractually specified collateral or settle the liability, we would have been required to pay approximately $33 million at December 31, 2011. Retail Operations We obtain credit scores for our firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed our credit threshold. We consider potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on a review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, we also assign physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties Moodys, S&P and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements. 56 Wholesale Services We have established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. We also utilize master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When we are engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and we also have a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of our credit risk. We also use other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom we conduct significant transactions. Master netting agreements enable us to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. We also net across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. Additionally, we may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. We conduct credit evaluations and obtain appropriate internal approvals for our counterpartys line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long term debt rating of Baa3 from Moodys and BBB from S&P. Generally, we require credit enhancements by way of guaranty, cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings. We have a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30 day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. As of December 31, 2011, excluding $11 million of customer deposits, our top 20 counterparties represented approximately 60% of the total counterparty exposure of $504 million, derived by adding together the top 20 counterparties exposures, exclusive of customer deposits, and dividing by the total of our counterparties exposures. As of December 31, 2011, our counterparties, or the counterparties guarantors, had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of BBB+, which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moodys ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moodys and 1 being D or Default by S&P and Moodys. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to an S&P equivalent. The following table shows our third party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions. As of December 31, Gross receivables Gross payables In millions 2011 2010 2011 2010 Netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade $ 395 $ 515 $ 255 $ 341 Counterparty is non investment grade 23 11 47 40 Counterparty has no external rating 184 260 288 363 No netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade 4 2 0 0 Counterparty has no external rating 1 0 0 0 Amount recorded on Statements of Financial Position $ 607 $ 788 $ 590 $ 744 We have certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status. Under such circumstances, we would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties. If such collateral were not posted, our ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired. If our credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade status, the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements with our counterparties would have totaled $15 million at December 31, 2011, which would not have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 57
