ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the companys business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics designs, develops, manufactures and supports leading edge technology products and services for mission critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat vehicles, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation. The companys primary customers are the U.S. military, other government organizations, the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and industrial buyers. It operates through four primary business groups Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Aerospace and a smaller Resources group. The company has two primary business markets defense and business aviation. The majority of the companys revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. The Global War on Terrorism, Operation Iraqi Freedom and homeland defense concerns have focused the U.S. governments efforts on ensuring that U.S. armed forces are equipped and trained to prevail in small and large scale conflicts around the world. At the same time, the president and the Department of Defense have indicated that they are committed to transforming the military into a more agile, responsive, lethal and survivable force for future engagements. These endeavors have driven steady funding increases for the Department of Defense since 2001. For fiscal year 2004, Congress appropriated $375 billion for the Department of Defense, a 21 percent increase in funding since 2001. This amount includes $140 billion for weapons and equipment procurement and research and development activities, an increase of 36 percent since 2001. These two funding areas deliver the majority of the companys revenues, and their sustained increases demonstrate solid administration and congressional support for the U.S. military. Congress provided additional funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom, bringing the Department of Defenses total funding to over $440 billion for fiscal year 2004. For fiscal year 2005, the president has requested that Congress appropriate $402 billion for the Department of Defense, a 7 percent increase over 2004, including $144 billion for procurement and research and development. While Department of Defense funding levels may change over time, levels of funding available for the companys programs are expected to remain consistent for 2004 and 2005. The global defense market is shaped largely by the demands of the U.S. military. Many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations. The company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales as it expands its market presence in Europe. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 15 Table of Contents The Aerospace group is one of the worlds leading designers and manufacturers of business jet aircraft and is a leader in the long range and ultra long range, large cabin business jet market. The companys market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business aviation products by U.S. and foreign businesses, the U.S. and other governments and high net worth individuals. Business aviation was affected by the global economic slowdown in recent years. During that time, the company pursued aggressive management initiatives to improve efficiency and introduced new products that expanded the markets served by its aircraft. The company anticipates an improved environment as the global economy shows signs of recovery and the business jet aircraft market stabilizes. The company will continue to implement improved business processes to take full advantage of these conditions. The companys management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company has proven itself as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows, which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Results of Operations The companys net sales were $16.6 billion in 2003, up 20 percent over 2002. Acquisitions in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems and strong organic growth in the companys defense businesses contributed to the sales growth, offset in part by reduced sales of new aircraft in Aerospace. The overall organic growth in 2003 was 8 percent, led by 20 percent organic growth in Information Systems and Technology. Growth from acquisitions in 2003 was 12 percent. In 2002, net sales increased by 15 percent over 2001 on strong volume in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems, as well as contributions from acquired businesses. About half of the sales growth in 2002 was organic. Net earnings grew more than 9 percent from 2002, to just over $1 billion in 2003. This increase resulted from both organic growth and acquisitions in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems, but was offset partially by decreased earnings in Marine Systems and Aerospace. The downward pressure on 2003 earnings from Marine Systems was driven by performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts. Aerospace 2003 earnings were lower because of reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures, particularly in the first half of the year; however, management is cautiously optimistic that the business aviation market has stabilized. For 2002, the companys net earnings were essentially flat compared with 2001 because of an after tax charge of $134, reported as discontinued operations, that was associated with the companys exit from its undersea fiber optic cable laying business. The company generated significant cash flow from operating activities in 2003 through strong operating results and diligent management of working capital, including sharply reduced levels of pre owned aircraft inventory. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2003 compared with $1.1 billion in 2002 and 2001. The company used its cash to pay down debt, as reflected in an increase in net debt of only $2.1 billion during the year, despite making acquisitions in excess of $3 billion. The company also used the funds to repurchase its common shares, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. In 2002 and 2001, cash from operating activities approximated net income. General and administrative (GA) expenses as a percentage of sales have remained consistent year over year at around 6.5 percent. GA was $1.1 billion in 2003, $903 in 2002 and $808 in 2001. Income from non operating items was $3 in 2003 compared with $47 in 2002, which included a $36 gain from the sale of some assets of the Space Propulsion operation within Combat Systems. In 2001, expense 16 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents from non operating items was $5. Net interest expense increased to $98 in 2003 from $45 in 2002, the result of a higher average borrowing balance from the companys issuance of additional debt to fund acquisitions. Net interest expense was $56 in 2001. The companys effective tax rate was 27.3 percent in 2003, 33.6 percent in 2002 and 33.8 percent in 2001. The 2003 tax rate was lower than in previous years because of a settlement of the 1996 to 1998 audit cycle with the Internal Revenue Service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes. These events resulted in non cash benefits totaling $68, favorably impacting the companys tax rate by 5 percent. As noted above, the company exited its undersea fiber optic cable laying business in the fourth quarter of 2002 because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog. The results of this business operations are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for all periods presented. The company recognized an after tax gain of $7 in 2003 upon the favorable resolution of certain liabilities related to this business. In 2002, the company recognized an after tax loss of $134, including an after tax charge of $109 for ship lease obligations and the write down of assets to net realizable value. In 2001, the cable laying business operated at a break even level. Operating results from this business had been included in the Information Systems and Technology group since 1998. Backlog The companys total backlog increased 42 percent over 2002 to $41.1 billion at year end 2003. This growth resulted from substantial new order activity in all business groups and acquisitions in Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems. New orders received during 2003 totaled $25 billion, including an $8.4 billion submarine order in the Marine Systems group. The companys funded backlog grew 18 percent over 2002 to $25.3 billion at the end of 2003. The companys defense businesses contributed $34.3 billion to the 2003 year end total backlog, an increase of 57 percent over 2002. This portion of the total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog increased to $21 billion in 2003 and includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by Congress and funded by the customer. The unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. The backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The total potential value of these contracts was approximately $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2003, up from $3 billion at the end of 2002, and may be realized over the next 10 years. The Aerospace groups total backlog of $6.5 billion remained steady in 2003 despite adverse economic conditions in the business jet market in late 2002 and the first half of 2003. The Aerospace funded backlog was $4.1 billion at the end of 2003 and includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The unfunded backlog, which consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services, was $2.4 billion at year end 2003, up slightly from 2002. The Resources groups backlog was $220 as of year end 2003, of which $163 was funded. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,978 $ 3,681 $ 1,297 35 % Operating earnings 538 436 102 23 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.8 % The Information Systems and Technology group experienced strong net sales and operating earnings growth in 2003 from substantial organic growth and the addition of several new businesses. Volume increased in 2003 across all of the groups operations, reflecting the growing importance of digital, network centric C4ISR and information sharing technologies in the defense and intelligence communities. This growth included increases in: Sales activity in infrastructure and information technology support services; Deliveries of ruggedized computing equipment and high speed encryption products; Sales to intelligence agencies; and Volume on communications systems such as the BOWMAN program, a secure digital voice and data communications system for the United Kingdoms armed forces. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 17 Table of Contents The groups overall operating margin decreased slightly in 2003 as a result of lower margins in the businesses acquired during the year, and because earnings in 2002 included the favorable resolution of some commercial program exposures. During 2003, the company completed three acquisitions in the group Creative Technology Incorporated in March, Veridian Corporation in August and Digital System Resources, Inc., in September. The company believes these acquisitions strengthen its product mix and service offerings and expand its customer base within the intelligence and defense agencies of the U.S. government. Also during 2003, the company combined two business units into a new business unit, General Dynamics C4 Systems. The company believes the combination of these two operations will enhance its competitive position and enable it to more efficiently serve its customers. The combined business unit provides systems integration capabilities in the areas of tactical networks, information assurance, command and control, space products and systems, and military radios. For 2004, the company expects continued strong revenue and earnings growth in the Information Systems and Technology group, driven by the 2003 acquisitions, the groups expanding customer base and the continued fielding of growing programs, such as BOWMAN and the Coast Guards Rescue 21 search and rescue system. The company anticipates a modest decrease in operating margins as it continues to integrate the newly acquired businesses and as new awards change the groups contract mix. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 3,681 $ 2,691 $ 990 37 % Operating earnings 436 261 175 67 % Operating margin 11.8 % 9.7 % In 2002, net sales and operating earnings were up considerably over 2001. The increases resulted from organic growth in core government programs, such as the BOWMAN program, and the acquisition of Integrated Information Systems Group (IISG) from Motorola, Inc., in September 2001. Operating margins in 2002 were significantly higher than historical averages due to a shift in the groups product mix, including accelerated deliveries of encryption products, the acquisition of Decision Systems, the reduction of commercial program exposures discussed above, and the elimination of goodwill amortization upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Backlog The Information Systems and Technology groups backlog increased $2.4 billion in 2003 to $7.7 billion at year end, from both acquisitions and new order activity. Over 80 percent of the groups backlog at year end was funded. In contrast with the companys other defense businesses, Information Systems and Technologys backlog consists of a large number of relatively small dollar value contracts and programs. These include programs that support the U.S. governments military transformation, homeland security initiatives and overseas programs that underscore the growing international market for the companys products and services. The groups backlog does not include approximately $6.5 billion of potential contract value awarded under IDIQ contracts. A significant portion of this IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole source supplier over several years to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies. Management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customers future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. In 2003, the company received two significant awards that extend two of the groups longest running programs. The Army awarded the company the Common Hardware/Software III (CHS 3) contract to provide continually updated commercial and ruggedized computers, network hardware equipment, power subsystems, peripheral devices and commercial software to the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and other federal agencies worldwide. This IDIQ contract, which has a potential value of $2 billion over its 10 year life, is a follow on to the companys CHS 2 contract, now entering its tenth year. In addition, the Air Force selected the company for an IDIQ contract, called Intelligence Information, Command and Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2), to support and maintain critical intelligence and command and control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide. The contract, which extends a program that 18 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents the company has been operating for over 25 years, has a four year base term with two three year options and a total potential value of $2 billion. The company won several other notable awards during the year, including contracts to develop and demonstrate several aspects of the Armys Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. The FCS program, which is central to the Armys transformation initiative, is a family of advanced, networked air and ground based systems. The Information Systems and Technology group was selected to provide the integrated computer system, sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services for FCS. The combined value of these Information Systems and Technology awards is in excess of $350 over the next five years, with potential for follow on production activity. Combat Systems is performing additional work on the FCS program. The Army also selected the company to develop, produce and integrate the Land Warrior soldier system. This program provides the individual soldier with personal electronics, communications, global navigation and other integrated equipment designed to increase awareness, lethality and survivability. The Army plans to fully integrate this system with the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams and the FCS program. Including options, the Land Warrior program has a potential value of approximately $790 over the next seven years. The Army awarded the company a contract with a potential value of approximately $300 over 10 years to integrate a voice and data communications system, called the Secure Enroute Communications Package Improved (SECOMP I). This system is designed to enable joint tactical forces to arrive at their deployment destinations fully briefed on the most current intelligence reports and plan updates available. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,166 $ 2,923 $ 1,243 43 % Operating earnings 463 323 140 43 % Operating margin 11.1 % 11.1 % The Combat Systems groups net sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2003 primarily due to a series of acquisitions during the year that broadened the companys product base, opened new markets and further aligned the company with Department of Defense transformational initiatives. The growth from acquisitions was augmented by steady organic growth in sales and operating earnings, including increased volume in the Leopard tank production program in Spain, growing contributions to the Armys FCS program and strong performance in the companys munitions and armaments operations. This growth was offset slightly by fewer Abrams main battle tank upgrades, reduced deliveries of the Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicle in Spain and the 2002 termination of the Crusader program. During 2003, the company completed three acquisitions in the group General Motors Defense (GM Defense) in March, Intercontinental Manufacturing Company in September and Steyr Daimler Puch Spezialfahrzeug Aktiengesellschaft Company KG (Steyr) in October. The acquisition of GM Defense included MOWAG, a combat vehicle operation based in Switzerland. With the addition of MOWAG and Steyr to the companys existing combat vehicle presence in Spain, the company created a new business unit called General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems, based in Vienna, Austria. The company believes the consolidation of these businesses under common management positions the Combat Systems group to strengthen its market base, better serve its customers and more competitively pursue land combat systems opportunities around the world. The company believes the Combat Systems group, with its broad and diverse base of product offerings and substantial backlog, is well positioned for solid growth in 2004 and beyond. Accordingly, management expects strong revenue and earnings growth for the group in 2004 with operating margins consistent with 2003. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 2,923 $ 2,210 $ 713 32 % Operating earnings 323 238 85 36 % Operating margin 11.1 % 10.8 % For 2002, organic growth was the primary driver of the significant increases in net sales and operating earnings in the Combat Systems group. This growth was fueled by increased production on the first brigade of the Stryker program, increased deliveries on the Leopard program, higher volume on various munitions programs and additional development work on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV, formerly the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle). The acquisition of Advanced Technical Products, Inc., in June 2002 also contributed to the net sales and operating earnings growth in 2002. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Backlog The Combat Systems groups total backlog rose 71 percent in 2003 to $8.5 billion at year end because of acquisitions and new order activity, including several significant contract awards. The groups funded backlog also grew significantly, from $4.2 billion in 2002 to $6 billion at the end of 2003. The groups backlog consists primarily of long term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through 2012. During 2003, Combat Systems won several contracts to partner with the U.S. military as it transforms its forces for the future. The company received an order from the Army for the third of six brigades of Stryker wheeled combat vehicles, a key component of the Armys transformation to a lighter, more mobile force. The order, for 267 vehicles, is valued at $384 and is scheduled for delivery in 2004. The year end backlog included $566 for the production of Stryker vehicles. Congress appropriated funding in 2004 for the fourth brigade, and the 2005 budget request includes funding for the fifth brigade. The first brigade of Stryker vehicles is deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. With the acquisition of GM Defense, the company has consolidated its lead role on the $4 billion Stryker program, which calls for a total of 2,096 vehicles for six planned brigades. The company believes there is significant potential for international sales of these vehicles. In addition, the group and its teaming partner were selected to develop and demonstrate portions of the Armys FCS program. The contracts awarded to the Combat Systems group in 2003 have a value of $2.2 billion and include engineering development and demonstration of a family of eight manned ground vehicles, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for unmanned and manned ground vehicles. These ground vehicles are intended to be the new generation of Army combat vehicles. The Army also awarded Combat Systems the lead technology integration contract for the second phase of its Future Force Warrior (FFW) advanced technology demonstration program. The $100 award is for completion of detailed designs of the FFW network centric soldier system, part of the Armys plan to create a highly networked, lethal, survivable soldier of the future. The system development and demonstration phase of this program has a potential value of $1 to $3 billion over a 10 year period. The Combat Systems backlog also included approximately $380 for the continued design and development of the Marine Corps EFV program. Seven out of nine new infantry carrier prototypes, as well as a command and control prototype, have been completed as of year end 2003. Initial production of more than 1,000 vehicles is scheduled to begin in 2006. The company received additional funding to upgrade M1A2 Abrams battle tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration. Through this program, the company retrofits M1A2 tanks with improved electronics, command and control capabilities and armor enhancements that improve the tanks effectiveness. The administrations 2005 budget request includes funding for more M1A2 SEP upgrades. In addition, the company was awarded a contract modification in 2003 to provide 125 M1A1 hardware kits for the Egyptian tank co production program, bringing the total program, which began in 1992, to 880 M1A1 tank kits. The Combat Systems groups Leopard program is a long term battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army under license from a German company. The year end backlog included $1.4 billion for the production of 232 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2008. The company also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The Spanish government awarded the company a contract valued at $640 for the second phase of the Pizarro program, bringing the total program value to almost $900, with deliveries of 212 vehicles scheduled through 2012. Combat Systems backlog at year end 2003 included approximately $1.2 billion in armament, munitions and composite structures programs, such as reactive armor for the Bradley fighting vehicle and various trainable gun mount systems. The ammunition programs include a $200 order from the Army in 2003 for rockets, motors and warheads for the Hydra 70 (70mm) rocket system, which raised the program value to date to over $800 and extended deliveries through 2006. The Army also awarded the company a contract to add a precision guidance system to the 70mm rocket family as part of the development of the next generation Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS). The composite structures programs include work on numerous aerospace platforms, including the F 16, F 18, F 22, C 17, Joint Strike Fighter and unmanned aerial vehicles such as the Global Hawk and the Predator. 20 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 4,271 $ 3,650 $ 621 17 % Operating earnings 216 287 (71 ) (25 )% Operating margin 5.1 % 7.9 % The Marine Systems groups net sales grew in 2003 from increases in volume across the group, including contracts for design and early stage production on the Virginia class submarine, conversion of Trident submarines (SSGN) and design and production of T AKE combat logistics ships. Commercial shipbuilding, engineering and repair volume also rose during the year. These increases were offset partially by lower volume on several mature production programs, including the Seawolf class submarine program. Operating earnings and margins for the Marine Systems group declined in 2003 because of performance problems on two commercial shipbuilding contracts. In the first quarter of the year, earnings were affected by problems first encountered in 2002 in the construction of two roll on/roll off cargo ships for Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc. (TOTE). After the first quarter, there was no further erosion in this program. The two TOTE ships under contract have been delivered to the customer. In the latter part of the year, the group experienced problems during the construction of the first ship of a contract to produce four double hull oil tankers. Management evaluated the programs performance and the estimates to complete the four ships and recognized losses totaling approximately $70 on the contract. The first ship was in the water in the fourth quarter of 2003 and was approximately 90 percent complete at year end. Although the company does not expect any additional charges associated with these ships, management will continue to monitor the program closely. The first two ships are scheduled to be delivered in 2004, the third in 2005 and the fourth in 2006. The company expects revenue growth in the Marine Systems group in 2004 as the group executes its substantial backlog. Based on this large backlog of steady, long term production programs and managements current belief that the group has turned the corner on its commercial shipbuilding problems, the company expects Marine Systems operating margins to improve steadily in 2004. Other significant events expected in 2004 include the May 30 expiration of a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union at Bath Iron Works, which represents approximately 65 percent of its work force. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 3,650 $ 3,612 $ 38 1 % Operating earnings 287 310 (23 ) (7 )% Operating margin 7.9 % 8.6 % In 2002, Marine Systems net sales were flat and operating earnings were down slightly from 2001. New commercial ship design work and an increase in volume on the Virginia class submarine program were offset by lower volume on mature production programs. This shift in the groups contract mix, along with the problems on the TOTE program discussed above, caused earnings and operating margins to decrease in 2002. Backlog The Marine Systems groups backlog grew remarkably in 2003 as a result of several significant contract awards. At the end of 2003, the groups backlog reached an all time high of $18.2 billion, a 56 percent increase over 2002. The backlog consists of numerous long term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as repair and engineering contracts. The Navys shipbuilding plan will continue to have a significant influence on Marine Systems backlog. In 2003, the Navy awarded the company an $8.7 billion contract for the construction of the next six Virginia class submarines, the largest submarine order in U.S. history. The contract authorizes construction of one ship per year from 2003 through 2008. In January 2004, the five ships planned for construction from 2004 through 2008 became part of a multiyear agreement, saving the customer approximately $300 and shifting $1.5 billion from unfunded to funded backlog. In 1998, the Navy had awarded the company a contract to build the first four Virginia class submarines of this potential 30 ship program. The Marine Systems groups backlog at year end included $1.7 billion associated with these first four submarines, with one submarine scheduled to be delivered each year from 2004 through 2007. The lead ship in the class, the Virginia, was christened in August 2003. The company is the prime contractor on this program, and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents The company received $310 in modifications to its contract to convert four Ohio class Trident ballistic missile submarines to an SSGN configuration, a multi mission submarine optimized for tactical strike and special operations support. These modifications are part of a $443 contract that the Navy awarded to Marine Systems in 2002 for the design and related support of this conversion program. In addition, the Navy awarded the Information Systems and Technology group over $100 in contracts in 2003 to support the SSGN conversion. In 2003, the Navy awarded the company a $953 contract modification to provide funding for the next two Arleigh Burke class DDG destroyers, part of a seven ship award received in September 2002. At the end of 2003, the groups backlog included 12 DDGs scheduled for delivery through 2010. The 2005 defense budget includes two DDGs. An international team led by the Marine Systems group was one of three contractors that received contracts in 2003 to develop preliminary designs for the Navys Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The LCS is an integrated surface combatant intended to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats, high speed swarm boats, mines and diesel submarines. The Navy plans to award construction contracts in 2004 to two of the three remaining competitors for two ships each. The first ship delivery is scheduled in 2007. In 2003, the Navy exercised an option to build a fourth T AKE ship, a new class of combat logistics ships. This option is valued at approximately $290 and is part of a potential 12 ship contract awarded to the company in 2001. The backlog included $1.1 billion at year end for the construction of the first four ships, which are scheduled to be delivered between 2005 and 2007. In January 2004, the Navy exercised options worth approximately $580 for the fifth and sixth T AKE ships. The contract has options for six more ships over the next five years, for a total potential contract value of approximately $3.7 billion. AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 2,946 $ 3,289 $ (343 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 218 447 (229 ) (51 )% Operating margin 7.4 % 13.6 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 74 85 Completion 74 94 The Aerospace groups sales and earnings were $2,946 and $218, respectively, for 2003, down from the previous year. The groups performance was affected by a deterioration in the business aviation market during the second half of 2002 and the first half of 2003. The deterioration was driven primarily by lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and pre owned aircraft. In particular, the oversupply of relatively new pre owned aircraft available for sale in the market put additional pricing pressure on both new and pre owned aircraft. These conditions lowered sales and put downward pressure on margins. In response, the company took a series of actions, including cost reductions, layoffs and process improvements to reduce costs and improve profitability on an ongoing basis. The company expects to realize significant annual expense savings beginning in 2004 as a result of these actions. Market conditions appeared to improve during the second half of 2003, and the company is cautiously optimistic that the outlook for the Aerospace group is improving. The group experienced quarter over quarter sales and earnings growth beginning in the second quarter of 2003, and new aircraft manufacturing margins improved steadily throughout the year. Pre owned and new aircraft inventories at year end declined considerably from 2002, and losses associated with pre owned aircraft activity were all but eliminated by the fourth quarter, resulting in fewer losses in pre owned aircraft for the full year 2003 ($64) than in 2002 ($81). Orders for new aircraft increased each quarter during the year and reached record levels in the fourth quarter of 2003. Market data also indicate that prices are stabilizing on both new and pre owned aircraft. The company expects improved earnings and operating margins in the Aerospace group on slightly higher deliveries in 2004, assuming price stabilization, elimination of pre owned losses and the realization of cost reduction actions taken in 2003.

The company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The following table summarizes key unit data for the Aerospace groups orders and backlog: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 New orders 75 76 71 Options exercised 3 2 2 Firm orders (a) 78 78 73 Cancellations (a) (12 ) (6 ) Total orders (a) 66 72 73 New options (a) 3 4 Firm contracts in backlog 158 173 131 Options in backlog 103 103 63 Total aircraft in backlog 261 276 194 Completions in backlog (b) 38 38 49 (a) Excludes fractional activity. The company received orders for 50 aircraft and 50 options in 2001, orders for 55 aircraft and 50 options in 2002 and cancellations for seven aircraft in 2003 from fractional customers. (b) Represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end. Backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. Backlog The Aerospace groups backlog remained steady in 2003 despite the difficult market conditions, ending the year at $6.5 billion, of which $4.1 billion was funded. The backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through 2010. Approximately $2.1 billion, or 51 percent, of the groups funded backlog is with NetJets Inc. (NetJets), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market, representing firm contracts for 114 aircraft. The unfunded backlog includes $1.4 billion for 100 aircraft options from NetJets, constituting 90 percent of the options in backlog. NetJets also represents almost 70 percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog. Deliveries of aircraft to NetJets are scheduled from 2004 through 2010 and represent as little as 4 percent and as much as 17 percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years. The groups remaining $2 billion of funded backlog at year end 2003 consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and approximately $440 of contracts with government customers. The company continues to pursue opportunities to provide special mission aircraft to military customers around the world. In 2003, the company was awarded a contract to provide four Gulfstream G550 aircraft to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The contract has an option for two additional G550 aircraft, for a total potential value of approximately $470. In addition, the companys Gulfstream G450 aircraft was designated the platform of choice by one of the two competitors in a pending U.S. military procurement for special mission ISR applications. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents RESOURCES The companys Resources group principally consists of two businesses: a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Variance Net sales $ 256 $ 286 $ (30 ) (10 )% Operating earnings 32 89 (57 ) (64 )% Net sales and operating earnings in the Resources group decreased in 2003 because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions and reduced earnings in the companys commercial pension plan. In 2002, earnings increased because the company, in response to the improved long term outlook for some of the coal operations contracts, reversed some contingency reserves that had been previously established. Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Variance Net sales $ 286 $ 276 $ 10 4 % Operating earnings 89 52 37 71 % Net sales and earnings in 2002 improved over 2001 because of increased volume and improved cost performance in the aggregates business. In addition, as noted above, earnings increased as a result of the reversal of contingency reserves. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid 1990s, the company embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment through strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the companys customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired more than 30 businesses at a total cost of approximately $13.2 billion. This has resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. In terms of overall capital deployment for 2003, the company consummated over $3 billion of acquisitions, repurchased approximately 4.7 million of its outstanding common shares at an average price of $64 per share and continued its trend of consecutive annual dividend increases. Meanwhile, and in spite of the $3 billion in acquisitions, net debt (total debt less cash and equivalents) increased only $2.1 billion to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2003. At the same time, the company converted a significant portion of its commercial paper to fixed rate debt to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates available to the company. The company ended the year with a cash balance of $860, total debt of $4 billion and a debt to capital ratio of 41 percent. Cash generation continues to be one of managements key areas of focus, and 2003 was a particularly strong year in this regard. Free cash flow from operations for the year totaled $1.5 billion, compared with $861 in 2002 and $745 in 2001. Management defines free cash flow from operations as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the companys ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions and paying dividends. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with the cash flow from operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Cash flow from operating activities $ 1,723 $ 1,125 $ 1,101 Capital expenditures (224 ) (264 ) (356 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 1,499 $ 861 $ 745 As discussed above, the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally, make strategic acquisitions and repurchase the companys shares in the open market. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in 2004, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short and long term liquidity needs. Management believes 24 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents that the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. Going forward in 2004, management anticipates focusing on operations and the integration of recently acquired businesses. The following is a discussion of the companys major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2003, compared with $1.1 billion in both 2002 and 2001. The increase in cash flows in 2003 was due to substantial reductions in both new and pre owned aircraft inventories in the Aerospace group and an influx of customer advances and deposits near the end of the year. In 2002 and 2001, cash provided by operating activities approximated net income. Termination of A 12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A 12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the companys expectations, the default termination is ultimately sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A 12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2003. In this outcome, the government contends the companys liability would be approximately $1.2 billion pretax, or $700 after tax. The company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $3.2 billion in 2003, $400 in 2002 and $1.7 billion in 2001. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures, offset slightly by cash received from the sale of assets. Business Acquisitions. On August 11, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of Veridian Corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2003, the company acquired GM Defense of London, Ontario, a business unit of General Motors Corporation, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. On June 14, 2002, the company acquired the outstanding stock of Advanced Technical Products, Inc., for $214 in cash, plus the assumption of $43 in outstanding debt, which was repaid at the time of the acquisition. On September 28, 2001, the company acquired IISG from Motorola, Inc., for $825 in cash. On June 5, 2001, the company acquired substantially all of the assets of Galaxy Aerospace Company LP, for $330 in cash, after a purchase price adjustment received during the first quarter of 2002. The company may be required to make additional payments to the selling parties, up to a maximum of approximately $300 through 2006, contingent on the achievement of specific revenue targets. On January 26, 2001, the company acquired Primex Technologies, Inc., for $334 in cash plus the assumption of $204 in outstanding debt, $149 of which was repaid at the time of the acquisition. The company completed several other business acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace groups during the last three years at a total cost of $515. The company financed these acquisitions by issuing commercial paper. The company refinanced a significant portion of this debt during 2003, as discussed in Financing Activities. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2003 were $224, down approximately 15 percent from $264 in 2002. In 2002, capital expenditures decreased approximately 25 percent from the $356 spent in 2001 as a result of the completion of a facility modernization project at the companys Bath Iron Works shipyard in 2001. The company expects capital expenditures in 2004 to remain consistent with 2003. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2003. Sale of Assets. On October 2, 2002, the company sold certain assets of its Space Propulsion operation for $90. The remainder of the Space Propulsion operation is included in the Combat Systems group. On February 15, 2001, the Aerospace group sold its engine overhaul business for $55. The company received approximately $60 in cash during the three year period ended December 31, 2003, from the sale of real estate in southern California. Financing Activities In 2003, cash provided by financing activities was $2 billion as a result of the issuance of fixed rate notes, offset in part by repayment of outstanding debt, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. In 2002, cash used by financing activities was $836, and cash provided was $908 in 2001. Debt Proceeds, Net. On April 3, 2003, the company filed a Form S 3 Registration Statement (the Registration Statement) with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register $3 billion of debt securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). On May 15, 2003, the company issued $2 billion of medium term fixed rate debt pursuant to the Registration Statement. On August 14, 2003, the company extended the debt registered to $3.1 billion and issued an additional $1.1 billion of medium term fixed rate debt pursuant to the Registration Statement. The proceeds were used to repay a substantial portion of the companys outstanding commercial paper. This had the effect of fixing interest rates on debt that previously carried variable rates. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents The resulting net reduction in commercial paper for 2003 was $529. Net repayments of commercial paper were $451 in 2002. In 2001, the company received net proceeds from commercial paper issuances of $825, which were used primarily to fund business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2003, the company had $183 of commercial paper outstanding with an average yield of approximately 1.1 percent and an average term of 10 days. The company expects to reissue commercial paper as it matures and has the option to extend the term up to 270 days. The company has $2 billion in bank credit facilities that serve as back up liquidity facilities to the commercial paper program. On August 27, 2001, the company issued $500 of three year floating rate notes due September 1, 2004. The notes are registered under the Securities Act. Interest on the notes resets quarterly at three month LIBOR plus 0.22 percent, and is payable each March, June, September and December. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time prior to their maturity at 100 percent of the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest on the date the notes are redeemed. The company used the net proceeds of the issuance to repay a portion of the borrowings under its commercial paper program. These floating rate notes are guaranteed by certain of the companys 100 percent owned subsidiaries. Approximately $750 of the companys borrowings is scheduled to mature in 2004. Based on the level of cash the company expects to generate from operations and the existing capacity under its financing arrangements, the company believes it has sufficient resources to pay these obligations. Share Repurchases. On March 7, 2000, the companys board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the companys issued and outstanding common stock in the open market. In January 2003, the company repurchased 3.2 million shares for approximately $210, which completely utilized the March 2000 authorization. On February 5, 2003, the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 6 million additional shares. The company has since repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares for $90 in 2003. The company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $100 in 2002 and 1.5 million shares for $113 in 2001 under the March 2000 authorization. Dividends. On March 3, 2004, the companys board of directors declared an increased regular quarterly dividend of $.36 per share the seventh consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $.32 per share in March 2003, to $.30 per share in March 2002 and to $.28 per share in March 2001. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2003, the company had no material off balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases. This includes guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the companys stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company. Contractual Obligations The following table presents information about the companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: Payment Due by Period Contractual obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (a) $ 5,077 $ 888 $ 775 $ 911 $ 2,503 Capital lease obligations 13 2 4 4 3 Operating leases 684 112 200 124 248 Purchase obligations (b) 4,434 1,099 1,545 1,148 642 Other long term liabilities (c) 2,554 1,074 480 362 638 $ 12,762 $ 3,175 $ 3,004 $ 2,549 $ 4,034 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments.

In addition, as disclosed in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company expects to make approximately $74 of contributions to its retirement plans in 2004, which has been excluded from the above amount. (c) Represents other long term liabilities on the companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of long term liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on managements estimates, which are largely based on historical experience. 26 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents Commercial Commitments The following table presents information about the companys commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003: Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Letters of credit (a) $ 921 $ 786 $ 114 $ $ 21 Trade in options (a) 229 129 100 $ 1,150 $ 915 $ 214 $ $ 21 (a) See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade in options. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Managements Discussion and Analysis of the companys Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other postretirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre owned aircraft inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long term defense contracts and programs using the percentage of completion method of accounting. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, rather than the cumulative catch up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract, while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input (e.g., costs incurred) or output (e.g., units delivered) measures, as appropriate to the circumstances. The percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. These estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates require the use of judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the companys contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. Business Aircraft. The company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the FAA in accordance with Statement of Position 81 1. These contracts usually provide for two major milestones: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenues at two points: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents Pre owned Aircraft Inventories. In connection with orders for new aircraft, the company routinely offers customers trade in options. Under these options, if exercised, the company will accept trade in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value. Once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft, the company records pre owned aircraft at the lower of trade in value or estimated net realizable value. The company treats any excess of the trade in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction. The company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate. The company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information. These valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors, including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market. These estimates require the use of judgment. Gross margins on sales of pre owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the judgment of both management and legal counsel. When it is probable that the company has incurred a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters and the companys exposure is reasonably estimable, the company records a charge against earnings. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the companys government contracts are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the companys estimated workers compensation, other insurance related assessments, retirement benefits and environmental expenses. These costs become allocable to contracts when they are paid. The company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time they are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including both existing backlog and probable follow on contracts. These efforts include numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the companys contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates require the use of judgment. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the companys remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Pension Plans. The company makes assumptions about discount rates and long term rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. These estimates require the use of judgment, including consideration of both current and future market conditions. The company consults with outside experts to determine the appropriate assumptions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension cost as determined under SFAS 87 could increase or decrease. If the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the companys net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately $3 in 2003. Likewise, had the interest rate used to discount the companys projected pension obligation increased or decreased by 25 basis points, the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased by approximately $3 or decreased by approximately $2 in 2003. The companys contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the companys government plans. The company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the companys future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in January 2003. The FASB revised FIN 46 in December 2003 to clarify certain provisions and amend the effective date. FIN 46 provides guidance on the consolidation of certain entities. The interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if the equity interest at risk is not sufficient to permit that entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or if the equity investors lack certain specified characteristics. FIN 46 is effective December 31, 2003, for special purpose entities created before February 1, 2003, and is effective in the first quarter of 2004 for all other variable interest entities. The company does not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 28 General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate and variable rate long term debt obligations, variable rate commercial paper and short term investments. As of December 31, 2003, the company had no short term investments. Fixed rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable until maturity and are not actively traded by the company in the market. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the companys fixed rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market rates of interest applicable to the companys commercial paper balances and floating rate notes would not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2003, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. The company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain inter company transactions in foreign currencies. The company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments, receipts and inter company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the companys portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $28 (pretax) and an incremental unrealized loss of $22 million (pretax). Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents
