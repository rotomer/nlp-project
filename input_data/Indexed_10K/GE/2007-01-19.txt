Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 2007 Restatement As discussed in the explanatory note to this Form 10 K/A and in note 1 to our financial statements, we are restating financial statements and other financial information for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, and financial information for the years 2002 and 2001, and for each of the quarters in the years 2005 and 2004. The restatement adjusts our accounting for interest rate swap transactions related to a portion of the commercial paper issued by General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) and General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS), each wholly owned subsidiaries of GE, from January 1, 2001, the date we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The restatement has no effect on our cash flows or liquidity, and its effects on our financial position at the ends of the respective restated periods are immaterial. Interest rate swaps agreements under which we pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a floating rate of interest on an agreed notional amount are used in meeting our objective of managing interest rate risk related to our commercial paper program. Many of our financial assets such as loans and leases have long term, fixed rate yields, and funding them with proceeds of commercial paper would expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are used to manage this risk. We use commercial paper in connection with interest rate swaps because that financing structure is highly effective at fixing interest rates, enabling us to match fixed rate assets with fixed rate funding (or match funding) provided by the hedged commercial paper. Consistent with our hedge documentation, we had measured and recognized hedge ineffectiveness each reporting period. We had never used the short cut treatment provided for in SFAS 133 for any of these hedges. The following table sets forth the effects of the error in accounting for interest rate swaps related to our commercial paper hedging program, more fully described beginning on page 3, on our previously reported earnings for the years 2001 through 2005, and each of the quarters in the years 2004 and 2005. Increase (decrease) in earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Total adjustment $ 358 $ 341 $ 325 $ (1,169 ) $ (328 ) Previously reported earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes $ 18,275 $ 16,285 $ 13,766 $ 15,798 $ 12,948 Percent variation from previously reported earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes 2.0 % 2.1 % 2.4 % (7.4 )% (2.5 )% (28) (In millions) Increase (decrease) in earnings from continuing operations(a) 2005 2004 Quarter 4th Qtr. 3rd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. 1st Qtr. 4th Qtr. 3rd Qtr. 2nd Qtr. 1st Qtr. Total adjustment $ 99 $ 173 $ (139 ) $ 225 $ 105 $ (224 ) $ 596 $ (136 ) Previously reported earnings from continuing operations $ 5,772 $ 4,569 $ 4,372 $ 3,562 $ 5,718 $ 3,941 $ 3,658 $ 2,968 Percent variation from previously reported earnings from continuing operations 1.7 % 3.8 % (3.2 )% 6.3 % 1.8 % (5.7 )% 16.3 % (4.6 )% (a) See also note 30 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Quarterly Information (Unaudited), as restated Changes to our previously reported earnings detailed above reflect the volatility resulting from recognizing changes in the fair value of our commercial paper interest rate swaps immediately in earnings, rather than recording them in earnings over the remaining term of the hedging relationship. Values of these swaps move directly with changes in interest rates: increases in interest rates produce positive earnings effects from fair value gains on the interest rate swaps, as the amount of cash we receive on the swaps variable cash flow stream increases versus its fixed payment stream; similarly, negative earnings effects result from fair value losses on the swaps associated with decreases in interest rates as the amount of cash received on the swaps variable cash flow stream decreases versus its fixed payment stream. Interest rates generally trended downward during the period from 2001 to the present, explaining the slightly negative effect on earnings from this accounting error correction. However, interest rates were volatile within the years for example increasing sharply in the second quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, resulting in more pronounced positive earnings effects in those periods. As these swaps are used in match funding arrangements, which protect against the economic exposure to changes in interest rates, there are offsetting fair value changes associated with the related fixed rate assets. Because fair value changes related to fixed rate assets are not recognized in earnings under the current accounting model, the elimination of hedge accounting through correction of the error presents the current earnings effects of only one of two equal and offsetting components of the economic relationship. The effects of these corrections resulted in a cumulative earnings decrease of $0.5 billion through December 31, 2005, all of which were related to interest rate swaps used in our commercial paper hedging program. Reversal of these cumulative adjustments will affect net earnings positively over the terms of the underlying interest rate swaps, but to a degree that we do not expect to be significant in any individual period given the terms of the arrangements and actions taken to eliminate the accounting volatility by modifying the documentation in a manner that will enable the swaps to qualify for hedge accounting effective January 1, 2007. Operations Our consolidated financial statements combine the industrial manufacturing, services and media businesses of General Electric Company (GE) with the financial services businesses of General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS or financial services). (29) In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered non GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. For such measures, we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in the Supplemental Information section. We present Managements Discussion of Operations in five parts: Overview of Our Earnings from 2003 through 2005, Global Risk Management, Segment Operations, Global Operations and Environmental Matters. Overview of Our Earnings from 2003 through 2005 Our results over the last several years reflect the global economic environment in which we operate. During these years, the economy has grown, but at a rate that, in historic terms, has been relatively modest. Long term interest rates have been stable. We also experienced a weaker, but recently strengthening, U.S. dollar, escalating energy costs and higher fossil fuel related raw material prices. Market developments in two industries in which we operate power generation and commercial aviation also had significant effects on our results. As the following pages show, our diversification and risk management strategies enabled us to continue to grow revenues and earnings to record levels during this challenging time. Of our six segments, Infrastructure (29% and 36% of consolidated three year revenues and total segment profit, respectively) was one of the most significantly affected by the recent economic environment. Infrastructures Energy business was particularly affected by the period of unprecedented U.S. power industry demands that peaked in 2002. The return to normal demand levels was reflected in subsequent lower shipments of large heavy duty gas turbine units. In 2003, we sold 175 such units, compared with 122 in 2004 and 127 in 2005. During these years we invested in other lines of power generation such as wind power and developed product services that we believe will position the Energy business well for continued growth in 2006 and beyond. We also continued to invest in market leading technology and services at Aviation, Transportation and Water. We had 1,405 commercial aircraft on lease at December 31, 2005, an increase of 63 aircraft from last year. All of our aircraft were on lease at the end of 2005, and at that time we held $10.6 billion (list price) of multiple year orders for various Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft, including 73 aircraft ($4.8 billion list price) scheduled for delivery in 2006, all under agreement to commence operations with commercial airline customers. Product services and sales of our Evolution Series locomotives continue to be strong. Industrial (22% and 10% of consolidated three year revenues and total segment profit, respectively) is particularly sensitive to economic conditions. Higher capacity, in combination with declining or weak volume growth in many of the industries in which it operates, resulted in increased competitive price pressures. The Consumer & Industrial business continued to grow through product innovation and its focus on high end appliances. The Plastics business was hit particularly hard during these three years because of additional pressure from significant inflation in natural gas and certain raw materials such as benzene. Increased earnings at Plastics reflected improved product pricing. (30) We have achieved strong growth in our Healthcare and NBC Universal segments with a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Healthcare (10% and 11% of consolidated three year revenues and total segment profit, respectively) realized benefits of acquisitions of Amersham plc (Amersham) in 2004 and Instrumentarium in 2003, expanding the breadth of our product and services offerings to the healthcare industry, and positioning us well for continued growth. NBC Universal (9% and 13% of consolidated three year revenues and total segment profit, respectively) has developed into a diversified world class media company over the last several years as the combination of NBC with Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP (VUE) in 2004 followed successful acquisitions of Telemundo and Bravo in 2002. NBC Universal revenues and segment profit rose 14% and 21%, respectively, in 2005, and 88% and 28%, respectively, in 2004, largely on acquisitions. We expect the technology and business model for the entertainment media industry to continue to evolve in the coming years and believe that NBC Universal is well positioned to compete in this challenging environment. Commercial Finance and Consumer Finance (together, 26% and 31% of consolidated three year revenues and total segment profit, respectively) are large, profitable growth businesses in which we continue to invest with confidence. In a challenging economic environment, these businesses grew earnings by a combined $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Commercial Finance and Consumer Finance have delivered strong results through solid core growth, disciplined risk management and successful acquisitions. The most significant acquisitions affecting Commercial Finance and Consumer Finance results in 2005 were the commercial lending business of Transamerica Finance Corporation; WMC Finance Co. (WMC), a U.S. wholesale mortgage lender; Australian Financial Investments Group (AFIG), a residential mortgage lender in Australia; and the Transportation Financial Services Group of CitiCapital. These acquisitions collectively contributed $1.9 billion and $0.2 billion to 2005 revenues and net earnings, respectively. Overall, acquisitions contributed $9.6 billion, $12.3 billion and $5.4 billion to consolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our consolidated net earnings in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $0.9 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, from acquired businesses. We integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible. Only revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth following quarter are attributed to such businesses. Dispositions also affected our operations through lower revenues of $2.0 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.3 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This resulted in lower earnings of $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and higher earnings of $0.2 billion in 2003. Significant matters relating to our Statement of Earnings are explained below. INSURANCE EXIT. In 2005, we reduced our exposure to insurance in a disciplined fashion and our exit is now in sight. On November 18, 2005, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Swiss Reinsurance Company (Swiss Re) to sell the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses and the European life and health operations of GE Insurance Solutions. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2006, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In May 2004, we completed the initial public offering of Genworth Financial, Inc. (Genworth), our formerly wholly owned subsidiary that conducted most of our consumer insurance business, including life and mortgage insurance operations. Throughout 2005, we continued to reduce our ownership in Genworth, currently at 18%. We intend to continue to dispose of our remaining shares in 2006, subject to market conditions. (31) We reported both the portions of GE Insurance Solutions described above and Genworth as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, we refer to captions such as revenues and earnings from continuing operations simply as revenues and earnings throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Similarly, discussion of other matters in our consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. WE DECLARED $9.6 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS IN 2005. Per share dividends of $0.91 were up 11% from 2004, following a 6% increase from the preceding year. In December 2005, our Board of Directors raised our quarterly dividend 14% to $0.25 per share. We have rewarded our shareowners with over 100 consecutive years of dividends, with 30 consecutive years of dividend growth, and our dividend growth for the past five years has significantly outpaced that of companies in the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 stock index. Except as otherwise noted, the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of GE (with GECS included on a one line basis) and GECS. See the Segment Operations section for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within GE and GECS. GE SALES OF PRODUCT SERVICES were $27.4 billion in 2005, a 9% increase over 2004. Increases in product services in 2005 and 2004 were widespread, led by continued strong growth at Infrastructure and Healthcare. Operating profit from product services was approximately $7.0 billion in 2005, up 14% from 2004, reflecting ongoing improvements at Infrastructure and Healthcare. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS reduced pre tax earnings by $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.2 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Costs of our principal pension plans increased over the last three years primarily because of the effects of: Prior years investment losses which reduced pre tax earnings by $0.5 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and Lowering pension discount rates which reduced pre tax earnings by $0.1 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Considering current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested, we have assumed that long term returns on our principal pension plan assets would be 8.5% throughout this period and in 2006. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles provide for recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees. We believe that our postretirement benefit costs will increase again in 2006 for a number of reasons, including further reduction in discount rates at December 31, 2005, and continued recognition of prior years investment losses relating to our principal pension plans. (32) Our principal pension plans had a surplus of $5.8 billion at December 31, 2005. We will not make any contributions to the GE Pension Plan in 2006. To the best of our ability to forecast the next five years, we do not anticipate making contributions to that plan so long as expected investment returns are achieved. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was $2.9 billion less than their respective projected benefit obligations. We expect to contribute $0.4 billion to these plans in 2006, the same amount that was contributed in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The funded status of our postretirement benefit plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance. See notes 6 and 7 for additional information about funded status, components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for discussion of pension assumptions. GE OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES are selling, general and administrative expenses, which increased 11% to $13.3 billion in 2005, following a 22% increase in 2004, substantially the result of acquisitions in both years. GE OPERATING PROFIT is earnings from continuing operations before interest and other financial charges, income taxes and the effects of accounting changes. GE operating profit was $13.3 billion in 2005, up from $11.4 billion in 2004 and $11.6 billion in 2003 (14.4%, 13.7% and 16.4% of GE total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively). The increase in 2005 operating profit reflected higher productivity (principally Healthcare and Infrastructure), volume (Infrastructure and NBC Universal) and prices (Industrial), partially offset by higher other costs across all segments. The decrease in 2004 reflected the combination of higher material and other costs (Industrial and NBC Universal), higher pension costs, lower prices (Infrastructure and Healthcare) and lower productivity (Infrastructure and NBC Universal), partially offset by increased volume (NBC Universal and Healthcare, reflecting 2004 combination/acquisition activity). RESTATED INTEREST ON BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES amounted to $15.1 billion, $11.6 billion and $10.4 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Substantially all of our borrowings are through GECS, where interest expense was $14.3 billion, $11.1 billion and $9.9 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Changes over the three year period reflected increased average borrowings and increased interest rates. GECS average borrowings were $346.1 billion, $319.2 billion and $305.0 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. GECS average composite effective interest rate was 4.2% in 2005, compared with 3.5% in 2004 and 3.2% in 2003. Proceeds of these borrowings were used in part to finance asset growth and acquisitions. In 2005, GECS average assets of $487.0 billion were 10% higher than in 2004, which in turn were 15% higher than in 2003. See the Financial Resources and Liquidity section for a discussion of interest rate risk management. RESTATED INCOME TAXES Income taxes are a significant cost. As a global commercial enterprise, our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions and tax characteristics of our income. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. (33) Income taxes on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes were 18.0% in 2005, compared with 18.2% in 2004 and 22.4% in 2003. Our consolidated income tax rate was essentially unchanged in 2005 from 2004 because the 2005 tax benefits from a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and from the growth in lower taxed global operations were about the same as the 2004 tax benefits from favorable U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlements, the NBC Universal combination, the 2004 reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and a lower tax rate on the sale of a portion of Gecis, our business process outsourcing operation (now Genpact). Our consolidated income tax rate decreased by 4.2 percentage points in 2004 as the benefits listed above for 2004 were greater than the tax benefits from certain business dispositions in 2003. A more detailed analysis of differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in note 8. The nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for GE and for GECS and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow. Because GE tax expense does not include taxes on GECS earnings, the GE effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to GE earnings excluding GECS. GE pre tax earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes excluding GECS earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes were $11.9 billion, $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. On this basis, GEs effective tax rate was 23.1% in 2005, 19.0% in 2004 and 26.7% in 2003. The increase in the 2005 rate over the 2004 rate was primarily attributable to the lack of current year counterparts to the 2004 settlements with the IRS and 2004 tax benefits associated with the NBC Universal combination, both discussed below, that together reduced the 2004 rate by 7.2 percentage points. Partially offsetting this increase were the favorable impact of a number of audit resolutions with taxing authorities and our 2005 repatriation of earnings at the reduced U.S. tax rate provided in 2004 legislation (together representing a 3.2 percentage point reduction of the GE tax rate). These 2005 tax benefits are reflected in note 8 in the lines All other net (1.6 percentage points) and Tax on global activities including exports (1.6 percentage points). The 2004 rate reduction was primarily a result of two items that decreased the 2004 GE tax rate by 7.2 percentage points settling several issues with the IRS for the years 1985 through 1999 and tax benefits associated with the NBC Universal combination. As part of the IRS settlements, we closed two significant issues: the 1997 tax free exchange of the Lockheed Martin convertible preferred stock we received on the disposition of our Aerospace business in 1993, and a 1998 tax loss on the sale of a Puerto Rican subsidiary. The tax portion of these settlements is included in the line IRS settlements of Lockheed Martin tax free exchange/Puerto Rico subsidiary loss in note 8. The tax benefits associated with the NBC Universal combination are included in the line All other net in note 8. The 2004 GE effective tax rate also reflects lower pre tax income primarily from lower earnings in the Energy business and higher costs related to our principal pension plans. Partially offsetting these changes was the non recurrence of certain 2003 tax benefits. GECS effective tax rate decreased to 12.3% in 2005 from 17.5% in 2004 and 16.1% in 2003. The 2005 GECS rate reflects the net benefits, discussed below, of a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business; and an increase in lower taxed earnings from global operations. Together, these items more than account for the 6.6 percentage point decrease in rate from 2004 reflected in the line Tax on global activities including exports in note 8. Partially offsetting these benefits was the nonrecurrence of the benefits from 2004 favorable settlements with the IRS and the low taxed disposition of a majority interest in Genpact. The lack of counterparts to these items increased the 2005 GECS tax rate by 1.7 percentage points. (34) The increase in the GECS effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 also reflected the net benefits, discussed below, of a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business, which decreased the 2004 effective tax rate 1.6 percentage points and is included in the line Tax on global activities including exports in note 8; tax benefits from favorable IRS settlements, which decreased the 2004 effective tax rate 1.2 percentage points and is included in the line All other net in note 8; and the low taxed disposition of a majority interest in Genpact which decreased the 2004 effective tax rate 0.8 percentage points, and is included in the line Tax on global activities including exports in note 8. Offsetting these benefits were the effects of higher pre tax income and the nonrecurrence of a 2003 tax benefit on the disposition of shares of ERC Life Reinsurance Corporation. As a result of the repeal of the extraterritorial income (ETI) taxing regime as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), our aircraft leasing business no longer qualifies for a reduced U.S. tax rate. However, the Act also extended to aircraft leasing, the U.S. tax deferral benefits that were already available to other GE non U.S. active operations. These legislative changes, coupled with a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and a favorable Irish tax ruling, decreased the GECS effective tax rate 2.8 percentage points in 2005 and 1.6 percentage points in 2004. Global Risk Management A disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization such as ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated. It is necessary for us to manage risk at the individual transaction level, and to consider aggregate risk at the customer, industry, geography and collateral type levels, where appropriate. The GE Board of Directors oversees the risk management process through clearly established delegation of authority. Board and committee meeting agendas are jointly developed with management to cover risk topics presented to our Corporate Risk Committee, including environmental, compliance, liquidity, credit, market and event risks. The GECS Board of Directors oversees the risk management process for financial services, and approves directly or by delegation all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as borrowings and investments. All participants in the risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the Board. The GECS Chief Risk Officer is responsible, through the Corporate Risk Function, for establishing standards for the measurement, reporting and limiting of risk; for managing and evaluating risk managers; for approving risk management policies; and for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization. The GECS Corporate Risk Function analyzes certain business risks and assesses them in relation to aggregate risk appetite and approval limits set by the GECS Board of Directors. Threshold responsibility for identifying, quantifying and mitigating risks is assigned to our individual businesses. Because the risks and their interdependencies are complex, we apply a Six Sigma based analytical approach to each major product line that monitors performance against external benchmarks, proactively manages changing circumstances, provides early warning detection of risk and facilitates communication to all levels of authority. Other corporate functions such as Financial Planning and Analysis, Treasury, Legal and our Corporate Audit Staff support business level risk management. Businesses that, for example, hedge financial risk with derivative financial instruments must do so using our centrally managed Treasury function, providing assurance that the business strategy complies with our corporate policies and achieves economies of scale. We review risks periodically with business level risk managers, senior management and our Board of Directors. (35) GECS employs about 11,000 dedicated risk professionals, including 6,600 involved in collection activities and 400 specialized asset managers who evaluate leased asset residuals and remarket off lease equipment. GE and GECS manage a variety of risks including liquidity, credit, market and event risks. Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to accommodate liability maturities, fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through access to funding at reasonable market rates. Additional information about our liquidity and how we manage this risk can be found in the Financial Resources and Liquidity section and in notes 18 and 27. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations. We face credit risk in our lending and leasing activities (see the Financial Resources and Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections and notes 1, 13, 14 and 29) and derivative financial instruments activities (see note 27). Market risk is the potential loss in value of investment and other asset and liability portfolios, including financial instruments, caused by changes in market variables, such as interest and currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and funding activities. We attempt to mitigate the risks to our various portfolios arising from changes in interest and currency exchange rates in a variety of ways that often include offsetting positions in local currencies or selective use of derivatives. Additional information about how we mitigate the risks to our various portfolios from changes in interest and currency exchange rates can be found in the Financial Resources and Liquidity section and in note 27. Event risk is that body of risk beyond liquidity, credit and market risk. Event risk includes the possibility of adverse occurrences both within and beyond our control. Examples of event risk include natural disasters, availability of necessary materials, guarantees of product performance and business interruption. This type of risk is often insurable, and success in managing this risk is ultimately determined by the balance between the level of risk retained or assumed and the cost of transferring the risk to others. The decision as to the appropriate level of event risk to retain or cede is evaluated in the framework of business decisions. Additional information about certain event risk can be found in note 29. Segment Operations Operating segments comprise our six businesses focused on the broad markets they serve: Infrastructure, Industrial, Healthcare, NBC Universal, Commercial Finance and Consumer Finance. For segment reporting purposes, certain GECS businesses are included in the industrial operating segments that actively manage such businesses and report their results for internal performance measurement purposes. These include Aviation Financial Services, Energy Financial Services and Transportation Finance reported in the Infrastructure segment, and Equipment Services reported in the Industrial segment. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we commenced reporting businesses affected by our insurance exit as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These businesses were previously reported in the Commercial Finance segment. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, our insurance activities, previously reported in the Commercial Finance segment, were transferred to Corporate items and eliminations for all periods presented. (36) Segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the Chief Executive Officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period. In connection with that assessment, the Chief Executive Officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring; rationalization and other similar expenses; in process research and development and certain other acquisition related charges and balances; technology development costs; certain gains and losses from dispositions; and litigation settlements or other charges, responsibility for which preceded the current management team. Segment profit always excludes the effects of principal pension plans and results reported as discontinued operations and accounting changes. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segments management is measured excluded in determining segment profit, which we refer to as operating profit, for Healthcare, NBC Universal and the industrial businesses of the Industrial and Infrastructure segments; included in determining segment profit, which we refer to as net earnings, for Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance, and the financial services businesses of the Industrial segment (Equipment Services) and the Infrastructure segment (Aviation Financial Services, Energy Financial Services and Transportation Finance).

The increase in volume was primarily at Energy, Aviation and Transportation. The decrease in prices was primarily at Energy, and was partially offset by increased prices at Transportation and Aviation. Revenues also increased as a result of organic revenue growth at Energy Financial Services ($0.4 billion) and Aviation Financial Services ($0.3 billion). Segment profit rose 14% to $7.8 billion, compared with $6.8 billion in 2004, as higher volume ($1.0 billion) and productivity ($0.2 billion including customer settlements and contract terminations) more than offset lower prices ($0.6 billion) and the effects of higher material and other costs ($0.3 billion) at the industrial businesses in the segment. The increase in volume primarily related to Energy, Aviation and Transportation. Segment profit also increased as a result of increased net earnings at the financial services businesses. This increase reflected core growth at Energy Financial Services ($0.3 billion) and core growth at Aviation Financial Services ($0.2 billion), including growth in lower taxed earnings from global operations related to a reorganization of our aircraft leasing operations. Infrastructure revenues increased 2%, or $0.8 billion, in 2004 as the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.5 billion), primarily at Energy, and higher volume ($0.4 billion) were partially offset by lower prices ($0.6 billion) at the industrial businesses of the segment, primarily at Energy. The increase in volume was the net result of increased sales in commercial services and military engines at Aviation and locomotives at Transportation, partially offset by lower sales at Energy. Energy sold 122 large heavy duty gas turbines in 2004, compared with 175 in 2003. Financial services activity, primarily at Aviation Financial Services and Energy Financial Services, increased revenues primarily from organic revenue growth ($0.4 billion) and acquisitions ($0.1 billion). (39) Segment profit fell 8%, or $0.6 billion, in 2004 as lower material costs ($0.3 billion), primarily at Energy, and higher volume ($0.1 billion) were more than offset by lower prices ($0.6 billion) and lower productivity ($0.6 billion) at the industrial businesses of the segment. The lower productivity was the net effect of lower productivity at Energy, primarily from the anticipated decline in higher margin gas turbine sales and a decrease in customer contract termination fees, partially offset by higher productivity at Aviation. Segment profit from the financial services businesses, primarily Energy Financial Services, increased $0.1 billion as a result of core growth. Infrastructure orders were $38.4 billion in 2005, up from $34.0 billion in 2004. The $29.2 billion total backlog at year end 2005 comprised unfilled product orders of $18.8 billion (of which 65% was scheduled for delivery in 2006) and product service orders of $10.4 billion scheduled for 2006 delivery. Comparable December 31, 2004, total backlog was $27.8 billion, of which $18.2 billion was for unfilled product orders and $9.6 billion for product services orders.

We realized price increases primarily at Plastics and Consumer & Industrial. Volume increases related primarily to the acquisitions of Edwards Systems Technology and InVision Technologies, Inc. by our Security business, but were partially offset by lower volume at Plastics. Revenues at Equipment Services also increased as a result of organic revenue growth ($0.4 billion) and acquisitions ($0.1 billion), partially offset by the effects of the 2004 disposition of IT Solutions ($0.4 billion). Segment profit rose 35%, or $0.6 billion, at the industrial businesses in the segment in 2005 as price increases ($1.5 billion) and higher volume ($0.1 billion) more than offset higher material and other costs ($0.8 billion), primarily from commodities such as benzene and natural gas at Plastics, and lower productivity ($0.2 billion). Segment profit at Equipment Services also increased as a result of improved operating performance, reflecting core growth ($0.1 billion). (40) Industrial revenues rose 23%, or $5.7 billion, in 2004 on higher volume ($2.0 billion), primarily at Consumer & Industrial and Plastics, the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.5 billion) and higher prices ($0.1 billion) at the industrial businesses in the segment. Higher prices at Plastics, as demand for plastic resins increased, were partially offset by lower prices at Consumer & Industrial. On January 1, 2004, we consolidated Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. (Penske), previously accounted for using the equity method. As a result, consolidated operating lease rentals and other income increased by $2.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, from 2003 levels. Segment profit rose 32%, or $0.4 billion in 2004, as productivity ($0.8 billion), primarily at Consumer & Industrial and Plastics, higher volume ($0.1 billion) and higher prices ($0.1 billion) more than offset higher material and other costs ($0.8 billion), primarily from commodities such as benzene and natural gas at Plastics. Segment profit at Equipment Services also rose on improved operating performance ($0.2 billion). See Corporate Items and Eliminations for a discussion of items not allocated to this segment. HEALTHCARE revenues increased 13% to $15.2 billion in 2005 as higher volume ($2.1 billion), including $0.8 billion from the Amersham acquisition in the second quarter of 2004, and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.1 billion) more than offset lower prices ($0.4 billion). Operating profit of $2.7 billion was 17% higher than in 2004 as productivity ($0.5 billion) and higher volume ($0.4 billion) more than offset lower prices ($0.4 billion) and higher labor and other costs ($0.1 billion). Healthcare revenues increased 32% to $13.5 billion in 2004 as higher volume ($3.3 billion), primarily from acquisitions including Amersham ($2.2 billion) and Instrumentarium ($1.0 billion), and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.4 billion) more than offset lower prices ($0.4 billion). Operating profit of $2.3 billion in 2004 was 34% higher than in 2003 as the effects of higher volume ($0.5 billion) and productivity ($0.5 billion) more than offset the effects of lower prices ($0.4 billion). See Corporate Items and Eliminations for a discussion of items not allocated to this segment. Orders received by Healthcare in 2005 were $15.6 billion, compared with $13.7 billion in 2004. The $5.4 billion total backlog at year end 2005 comprised unfilled product orders of $3.5 billion (of which 90% was scheduled for delivery in 2006) and product services orders of $1.9 billion scheduled for 2006 delivery. Comparable December 31, 2004, total backlog was $4.7 billion, of which $2.8 billion was for unfilled product orders and $1.9 billion for product services orders. NBC UNIVERSAL revenues rose 14%, or $1.8 billion, to $14.7 billion in 2005, reflecting a number of factors, the largest of which was the full year contribution from the May 2004 combination of NBC with VUE. The full year ownership of VUE was reflected in higher film revenues ($1.6 billion), growth of our entertainment cable business ($0.6 billion), and higher revenues from television production operations ($0.3 billion) and theme parks operations ($0.1 billion). Also contributing to the increase in 2005 revenues was $0.6 billion, partially from settling obligations related to preferred interests previously issued by VUE and partially from settling certain contracts as part of our MSNBC restructuring. Partial offsets arose from the lack of a current year counterpart to the 2004 Olympic Games broadcasts ($0.9 billion), effects of lower ratings on network and station ad sales ($0.4 billion) and an investment impairment ($0.1 billion). Segment profit rose 21%, or $0.5 billion, in 2005 as the full year ownership of VUE contributed $0.6 billion to higher earnings, including improvements in the film ($0.3 billion), entertainment cable ($0.3 billion) and television production ($0.2 billion) businesses. Effects of the preferred interests and restructuring transactions ($0.6 billion) were more than offset by the effects of lower earnings from network and station operations ($0.6 billion) and the investment impairment loss ($0.1 billion). (41) Revenues were up sharply in 2004, to $12.9 billion, and segment profit was up 28% to $2.6 billion. Operations were significantly affected by the May combination of NBC and VUE, which increased revenues by $4.7 billion and, net of effects of the 20% minority interest, operating profit by $0.6 billion. Other significant 2004 factors affecting results were the Olympic Games broadcasts ($0.9 billion higher revenues), price increases ($0.2 billion of revenues and operating profit), volume ($0.3 billion of revenues and $0.1 billion of operating profit) and $0.3 billion higher NBC Universal operating costs.

Revenues during 2005 and 2004 included $1.0 billion and $0.3 billion from acquisitions, respectively, and in 2005 were reduced by $0.7 billion as a result of dispositions. Revenues during 2005 also increased $1.1 billion as a result of organic revenue growth ($0.8 billion) and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.3 billion). The increase in net earnings resulted primarily from core growth ($0.6 billion), including growth in lower taxed earnings from global operations, acquisitions ($0.2 billion) and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.1 billion), partially offset by lower securitizations ($0.1 billion). Commercial Finance revenues and net earnings increased 15% and 23%, respectively, compared with 2003. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from acquisitions ($2.2 billion) and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.6 billion), partially offset by lower securitizations ($0.2 billion). The increase in net earnings resulted primarily from acquisitions ($0.4 billion), core growth ($0.3 billion) and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.1 billion), partially offset by lower securitizations ($0.1 billion).

Revenues for 2005 included $1.9 billion from acquisitions. Revenues during 2005 also increased $1.8 billion as a result of organic revenue growth ($1.5 billion) and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.3 billion). The increase in net earnings resulted primarily from core growth ($0.6 billion), including growth in lower taxed earnings from global operations, and acquisitions ($0.1 billion), partially offset by increased costs to launch new products and promote brand awareness ($0.2 billion). Consumer Finance revenues and net earnings increased 22% and 17%, respectively, from 2003. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from organic revenue growth ($1.0 billion), acquisitions ($1.0 billion) and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.8 billion). Organic revenue growth was achieved despite the absence of a 2004 counterpart to the 2003 gain on sale of The Home Depot private label credit card receivables ($0.9 billion). The increase in net earnings resulted from core growth ($0.6 billion), including growth in lower taxed earnings from global operations, acquisitions ($0.1 billion), and the weaker U.S. dollar ($0.1 billion), partially offset by the effects of The Home Depot private label credit card receivables ($0.4 billion) and increased costs to launch new products and promote brand awareness in 2004 ($0.1 billion).

Corporate Items and Eliminations is not an operating segment. Rather, it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to consolidated totals on the financial statements. (43) The caption GECS commercial paper interest rate swap adjustment consists of fair value changes associated with interest rate swaps that were designated as hedges of our commercial paper program. As more fully described beginning on page 28, the correction of our financial statements to eliminate the effects of hedge accounting for these swaps results in recognition in earnings of such fair value changes immediately rather than over the remaining term of the hedging relationship. Certain amounts included in the line Other above are not allocated to GE operating segments because they are excluded from the measurement of their operating performance for internal purposes. In 2004, these comprised $0.4 billion of Healthcare charges, principally related to the write off of in process research and development projects and other transitional costs associated with Amersham; and a $0.1 billion charge at Industrial as the gain on sale of the motors business was more than offset by costs for inventory obsolescence and other charges. In 2003, amounts not allocated to GE operating segments included charges of $0.2 billion for settlement of litigation, restructuring and other charges at Healthcare; and $0.1 billion for restructuring and other charges at Industrial. Changes in Other operating profit (cost) also reflect gains of $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion from partial sales of an interest in Genpact, in 2005 and 2004, respectively. DISCONTINUED INSURANCE OPERATIONS (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ (1,922 ) $ 534 $ 2,057 Discontinued operations comprise the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses and the European life and health operations of GE Insurance Solutions and most of its affiliates, that we agreed to sell in the fourth quarter of 2005; and Genworth, our formerly wholly owned subsidiary that conducted most of our consumer insurance business, including life and mortgage insurance operations. Results of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Loss from discontinued operations in 2005 reflected losses from the portions of GE Insurance Solutions described above ($2.8 billion), partially offset by Genworth earnings ($0.9 billion). GE Insurance Solutions results will be included in our 2006 discontinued operations to the date of closing, which is expected to be in the second quarter. Dividends we receive from Genworth and any gains or losses on sales of our remaining 18% position in Genworth common stock will also be reported in discontinued operations. Earnings from discontinued operations in 2004 reflected earnings of Genworth ($0.4 billion), including our share of 2004 earnings from operations ($0.8 billion), partially offset by the loss on the Genworth initial public offering in May 2004 ($0.3 billion), and GE Insurance Solutions ($0.1 billion), primarily 2004 operations. For additional information related to discontinued operations see note 2. (44) Global Operations Our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets, import and sale of products produced in other regions, leasing of aircraft, sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies. Thus, when countries or regions experience currency and or economic stress, we often have increased exposure to certain risks, but also often have new profit opportunities. Potential increased risks include, among other things, higher receivable delinquencies and bad debts, delays or cancelations of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft equipment, higher local currency financing costs and slowdown in established financial services activities. New profit opportunities include, among other things, more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing, expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower U.S. debt financing costs. Estimated results of global activities include the results of our operations located outside the United States plus all U.S. exports. We classify certain GECS operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as Other Global for this purpose.

Global revenues rose 16% to $77.9 billion in 2005 compared with $66.9 billion and $54.3 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Global revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 48% in 2005, compared with 45% and 44% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effects of the weaker U.S. dollar on reported results were to increase revenues by $0.9 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; and to increase earnings by $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. GE global revenues were $48.2 billion in 2005, up 15% over 2004, led by increases at Infrastructure and NBC Universal, mainly in Europe and the Pacific Basin. Exports from the U.S. were up 30%, led by Infrastructure, again showing strength in Europe and the Pacific Basin. GE global revenues in 2004 were $41.7 billion, up 27% over 2003, led by Healthcare, including the effects of the Amersham acquisition, and NBC Universal, reflecting the combination of NBC and VUE. U.S. exports grew 31% in 2004 on strong growth at Infrastructure. (45) GECS global revenues were $29.7 billion, $25.2 billion and $21.3 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. GECS revenues in the Pacific Basin increased 28% in 2005, primarily as a result of the acquisition of AFIG at Consumer Finance and organic revenue growth at Consumer Finance and Commercial Finance. GECS revenues increased 25% in Europe primarily as a result of higher investment income (largely offset by policyholder dividends) at our insurance activities, and organic revenue growth and acquisitions at Consumer Finance and Commercial Finance. Revenues in Other Global decreased 4% primarily as a result of the absence of a current year counterpart to the 2004 gain on the sale of a majority interest in Genpact, partially offset by organic revenue growth at the financial services businesses in Infrastructure. Global operating profit was $12.7 billion in 2005, an increase of 20% over 2004, which was 35% higher than in 2003. GE global operating profit in 2005 rose 30% reflecting solid growth in Europe and Other Global, mainly at Infrastructure. Total assets of global operations on a continuing basis were $299.4 billion in 2005, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 1%, over 2004. GECS global assets on a continuing basis of $261.9 billion at the end of 2005 were 1% higher than at the end of 2004, reflecting acquisitions and core growth, almost fully offset by the recently strengthening U.S. dollar. Financial results of our global activities reported in U.S. dollars are affected by currency exchange. We use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange, including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant cross currency transactions. Such principal currencies are the pound sterling, the euro, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. Environmental Matters Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws. We are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to $0.1 billion in each of the last two years. We presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion over the next two years. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled in February 2002 that approximately 150,000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) must be dredged from a 40 mile stretch of the upper Hudson River in New York state. On October 6, 2005, GE and the EPA entered into and filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York a consent decree that, subject to approval of that court, represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of the EPAs 2002 decision to dredge PCB containing sediments in the upper Hudson River. The dredging will be performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of performance after phase 1. Under this consent decree, we have committed up to $0.1 billion to reimburse the EPA for its past and future project oversight costs and agreed to perform the first phase of dredging. We further committed that, subject to future agreement with the EPA about completion of dredging after completion of phase 1 and the peer review, we will be responsible for further costs, including costs of phase 2 dredging. Our Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, included liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation. (46) Financial Resources and Liquidity This discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Changes in Shareowners Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows, Contractual Obligations, Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Debt Instruments, Guarantees and Covenants. The fundamental differences between GE and GECS are reflected in the measurements commonly used by investors, rating agencies and financial analysts. These differences will become clearer in the discussion that follows with respect to the more significant items in the financial statements. Overview of Financial Position Major changes in our financial position resulted from the following: In the fourth quarter of 2005, we announced the planned sale of most of GE Insurance Solutions and completed a Genworth secondary public offering, which reduced our ownership in Genworth from 27% to 18%. We have separately reported the assets and liabilities related to these discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our discontinued operations assets and liabilities decreased by $83.4 billion on September 27, 2005, when we reduced our ownership of Genworth to 27%, a level of investment that is reported as an associated company. As an associated company, our ongoing interest in Genworth operating results were presented on a one line basis. This deconsolidation had a significant effect on our assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. During 2005, we completed the acquisitions of Edwards Systems Technology at Industrial and Ionics, Inc. at Infrastructure. GECS completed acquisitions of the Transportation Financial Services Group of CitiCapital, the Inventory Finance division of Bombardier Capital, Antares Capital Corp., a unit of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., and INGs portion of Heller AG. The U.S. dollar was stronger at December 31, 2005, than it was at December 31, 2004, reducing the translated levels of our non U.S. dollar assets and liabilities. However, on average, the U.S. dollar in 2005 has been weaker than during the comparable 2004 period, resulting in increases in reported levels of non U.S. dollar operations as noted in the preceding Operations section. Minority interest in equity of consolidated affiliates decreased $4.5 billion during 2005 principally from settlement of the VUE preferred interests and our acquisition of the previously outstanding minority interest in VUE common stock (together $1.9 billion), and redemption of preferred stock at General Electric Capital Corporation (GE Capital) ($2.5 billion). See notes 16 and 22. Statement of Financial Position Because GE and GECS share certain significant elements of their Statements of Financial Position property, plant and equipment and borrowings, for example the following discussion addresses significant captions in the consolidated statement. Within the following discussions, however, we distinguish between GE and GECS activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement. (47) INVESTMENT SECURITIES comprise mainly available for sale investment grade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders, and debt and equity securities designated as trading and associated with certain non U.S. insurance contract holders who retain the related investment risks and rewards except in the event of our bankruptcy or liquidation. Investment securities were $53.1 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $56.9 billion at December 31, 2004. We regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position and, for fixed maturities whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Qualitative criteria include the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, as well as our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or until forecasted recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and third party asset managers. Our qualitative review attempts to identify those issuers with a greater than 50% chance of default in the following 12 months. These securities are characterized as at risk of impairment. Of available for sale securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2005, approximately $0.1 billion was at risk of being charged to earnings in the next 12 months; substantially all of this amount related to the automotive and commercial aviation industries. Impairment losses for 2005 totaled $0.1 billion compared with $0.2 billion in 2004. We recognized impairments in both periods for issuers in a variety of industries; we do not believe that any of the impairments indicate likely future impairments in the remaining portfolio. Gross unrealized gains and losses were $2.5 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2005, compared with $2.9 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004, primarily reflecting a decrease in the estimated fair value of debt securities as interest rates increased. At December 31, 2005, available accounting gains could be as much as $0.7 billion, net of consequential adjustments to certain insurance assets that are amortized based on anticipated gross profits. The market values we used in determining unrealized gains and losses are those defined by relevant accounting standards and should not be viewed as a forecast of future gains or losses. See note 10. We also hold collateralized investment securities issued by various airlines, including those operating in bankruptcy. Total amortized cost of these securities was $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005, and total fair value was $1.6 billion. Unrealized losses totaling $0.1 billion were associated with securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months, an improvement from the comparable $0.3 billion a year earlier. All of these securities have remained current on all payment terms; we do not expect the borrowers to default. Current appraised market values of associated aircraft collateral exceeded both the market value and the amortized cost of our related securities at December 31, 2005, offering protection in the event of foreclosure. Therefore, we expect full recovery of our investment as well as our contractual returns. WORKING CAPITAL, representing GE inventories and receivables from customers, less trade payables and progress collections, was $8.4 billion at December 31, 2005, up $0.1 billion from December 31, 2004, reflecting the effects of 2005 acquisitions. We discuss current receivables and inventories, two important elements of working capital, in the following paragraphs. (48) CURRENT RECEIVABLES for GE amounted to $15.1 billion at the end of 2005 and $14.5 billion at the end of 2004, and included $10.3 billion due from customers at the end of 2005 compared with $10.2 billion at the end of 2004. Turnover of customer receivables from sales of goods and services was 9.0 in 2005, compared with 9.4 in 2004. Other current receivables are primarily amounts that did not originate from sales of GE goods or services, such as advances to suppliers in connection with large contracts. See note 11. INVENTORIES for GE amounted to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2005, up $0.7 billion from the end of 2004. This increase reflected higher inventories at Aviation and the effects of 2005 acquisitions. GE inventory turnover was 8.3 in 2005 compared with 8.4 in 2004. See note 12. FINANCING RECEIVABLES is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues. The portfolio of financing receivables, before allowance for losses, was $292.2 billion at December 31, 2005, and $288.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The related allowance for losses at December 31, 2005, amounted to $4.6 billion, compared with $5.6 billion at December 31, 2004, representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for losses decreased $1.0 billion from 2004. The 2005 decrease reflected write offs of previously reserved financing receivables ($0.8 billion), principally commercial aviation loans and leases in our Infrastructure segment, and the recently strengthening U.S. dollar ($0.2 billion). During 2005, changes in U.S. bankruptcy laws prompted certain customers to accelerate filing for bankruptcy protection. These changes had an inconsequential effect on our allowance and earnings. Balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004, included securitized, managed GE trade receivables of $3.9 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. See notes 13 and 14. A discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows. For purposes of that discussion, delinquent receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due; nonearning receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due (or for which collection has otherwise become doubtful); and reduced earning receivables are commercial receivables whose terms have been restructured to a below market yield. Commercial Finance financing receivables, before allowance for losses, totaled $131.8 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $124.5 billion at December 31, 2004, and consisted of loans and leases to the equipment and leasing, commercial and industrial and real estate industries. This portfolio of receivables increased primarily from core growth ($39.9 billion) and acquisitions ($10.6 billion), partially offset by securitizations and sales ($37.3 billion) and the recently strengthening U.S. dollar ($2.0 billion). Related nonearning and reduced earning receivables were $1.3 billion (1.0% of outstanding receivables) at December 31, 2005, and $1.4 billion (1.1% of outstanding receivables) at year end 2004. Commercial Finance financing receivables are generally backed by assets and there is a broad spread of geographic and credit risk in the portfolio. Consumer Finance financing receivables, before allowance for losses, were $130.1 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $127.8 billion at December 31, 2004, and consisted primarily of card receivables, installment loans, auto loans and leases, and residential mortgages. This portfolio of receivables increased primarily as a result of core growth ($11.3 billion) and acquisitions ($0.4 billion), partially offset by the recently strengthening U.S. dollar ($7.8 billion), securitizations ($0.7 billion), loans transferred to assets held for sale ($0.5 billion) and dispositions ($0.4 billion). Nonearning consumer receivables were $2.8 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $2.5 billion at December 31, 2004, representing 2.1% and 2.0% of outstanding receivables, respectively. The increase was primarily related to higher nonearning receivables in our European secured financing business, a business that tends to experience relatively higher delinquencies but lower losses than the rest of our consumer portfolio. (49) Infrastructure financing receivables, before allowance for losses, were $19.1 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $20.9 billion at December 31, 2004, and consisted primarily of loans and leases to the commercial aircraft and energy industries. Related nonearning and reduced earning receivables were insignificant at December 31, 2005, down from $0.2 billion (0.8% of outstanding receivables) at December 31, 2004. Other financing receivables, before allowance for losses, were $11.2 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, and consisted primarily of financing receivables in consolidated, liquidating securitization entities. This portfolio of receivables decreased because we have stopped transferring assets to these entities. Nonearning receivables at December 31, 2005, were $0.1 billion (0.7% of outstanding receivables) compared with $0.2 billion (1.2% of outstanding receivables) at December 31, 2004. Delinquency rates on managed Commercial Finance equipment loans and leases and managed Consumer Finance financing receivables follow. December 31 2005 2004 2003 Commercial Finance 1.31 % 1.40 % 1.38 % Consumer Finance 5.08 4.85 5.62 Delinquency rates at Commercial Finance decreased from December 31, 2004, to December 31, 2005, primarily resulting from improved credit quality across all portfolios. The increase from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004, reflected the effect of certain acquired portfolios, partially offset by improvement in the overall core portfolio. Delinquency rates at Consumer Finance increased from December 31, 2004, to December 31, 2005, as a result of higher delinquencies in our European secured financing business, discussed above. The decrease from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004, reflected the results of the standardization of our write off policy, the acquisition of AFIG, and the U.S. acquisition of WMC, with lower relative delinquencies as a result of whole loan sales, partially offset by higher delinquencies in our European secured financing business, discussed above. See notes 13 and 14. OTHER GECS RECEIVABLES totaled $19.1 billion at December 31, 2005, and $15.0 billion at December 31, 2004, and consisted primarily of nonfinancing customer receivables, insurance receivables, amounts due from GE (generally related to certain material procurement programs), amounts due under operating leases, receivables due on sale of securities and various sundry items. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT amounted to $67.5 billion at December 31, 2005, up $4.4 billion from 2004, primarily reflecting acquisitions of commercial aircraft at the Aviation Financial Services business of Infrastructure. GE property, plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use, whereas the largest element for GECS was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases. Details by category of investment are presented in note 15. GE expenditures for plant and equipment during 2005 totaled $2.8 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in 2004. Total expenditures for the past five years were $12.7 billion, of which 32% was investment for growth through new capacity and product development; 37% was investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements; and 31% was investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and environmental protection. (50) GECS additions to property, plant and equipment were $11.6 billion and $10.7 billion during 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily reflecting additions of commercial aircraft at the Aviation Financial Services business of Infrastructure and vehicles at Commercial Finance and the Equipment Services business of Industrial. INTANGIBLE ASSETS were $81.7 billion at year end 2005, up from $78.5 billion at year end 2004. GE intangibles increased $3.1 billion from $54.7 billion at the end of 2004, principally as a result of goodwill and other intangibles related to the Edwards Systems Technology acquisition by Industrial, the Ionics, Inc. acquisition by Infrastructure and the acquisitions of an additional interest in MSNBC and the previously outstanding minority interest in VUE by NBC Universal. GECS intangibles increased $0.2 billion to $23.9 billion at December 31, 2005, resulting from goodwill associated with acquisitions partially offset by the recently strengthening U.S. dollar and purchase accounting adjustments. See note 16. ALL OTHER ASSETS totaled $87.4 billion at year end 2005, a decrease of $2.1 billion, reflecting NBC Universal settling obligations related to preferred interests previously issued by VUE and dispositions affecting real estate, partially offset by increases in assets held for sale. See notes 16 and 17. CONSOLIDATED BORROWINGS amounted to $370.4 billion at December 31, 2005, compared with $365.1 billion at the end of 2004. GE total borrowings were $10.2 billion at year end 2005 ($1.1 billion short term, $9.1 billion long term) compared with $11.0 billion at December 31, 2004. GE total debt at the end of 2005 equaled 8.1% of total capital compared with 9.0% at the end of 2004. GECS borrowings amounted to $362.1 billion at December 31, 2005, of which $157.7 billion is due in 2006 and $204.4 billion is due in subsequent years. Comparable amounts at the end of 2004 were $355.5 billion in total, $154.3 billion due within one year and $201.2 billion due thereafter. Included in GECS total borrowings were borrowings of consolidated, liquidating securitization entities amounting to $16.8 billion and $25.8 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A large portion of GECS borrowings ($97.4 billion and $96.9 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004, respectively) was issued in active commercial paper markets that we believe will continue to be a reliable source of short term financing. The average remaining terms and interest rates of GE Capital commercial paper were 45 days and 4.09% at the end of 2005, compared with 42 days and 2.39% at the end of 2004. The GE Capital ratio of debt to equity was 7.09 to 1 at the end of 2005 and 6.46 to 1 at the end of 2004. See note 18. EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISKS are managed with a variety of straightforward techniques, including match funding and selective use of derivatives. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient. In addition, we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are acquiring. We apply strict policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on derivatives trading, derivatives market making or other speculative activities. Following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using so called shock tests that model effects of shifts in rates. These are not forecasts. (51) It is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes. We fund our financial investments using debt or a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates and terms of our borrowings match the expected yields and terms on our assets. To test the effectiveness of our positions, we assumed that, on January 1, 2006, interest rates increased by 100 basis points across the yield curve (a parallel shift in that curve) and further assumed that the increase remained in place for 2006. We estimated, based on that year end 2005 portfolio and holding everything else constant, that our 2006 GE consolidated net earnings would decline by $0.2 billion. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. We analyzed year end 2005 consolidated currency exposures, including derivatives designated and effective as hedges, to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currencies. For such assets and liabilities, we then evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S. dollar. This analysis indicated that there would be an inconsequential effect on 2006 earnings of such a shift in exchange rates. Restated Statement of Changes in Shareowners Equity Shareowners equity decreased $1.6 billion in 2005, and increased $31.2 billion in 2004 and $15.7 billion in 2003. Changes over the three year period were largely attributable to net earnings, partially offset by dividends declared of $9.6 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.8 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, we purchased $5.3 billion of GE stock (153.3 million shares) under our $25 billion share repurchase program. In 2004, we issued 341.7 million shares of stock in connection with the Amersham acquisition, which increased equity by $10.7 billion, and 119.4 million shares of stock to partially fund the combination of NBC and VUE, which increased equity by $3.8 billion. Currency translation adjustments decreased equity by $4.3 billion in 2005, compared with a $3.9 billion increase in 2004. Changes in currency translation adjustments reflect the effects of changes in currency exchange rates on our net investment in non U.S. subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2005, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the pound sterling and euro. In 2004, the pound sterling, euro and, to a lesser extent, Asian currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar. See note 23. Accumulated currency translation adjustments affect net earnings only when all or a portion of an affiliate is disposed of or substantially liquidated. Overview of Our Cash Flow from 2003 through 2005 GE cash from operating activities (CFOA) is a useful measure of performance for our non financial businesses and totaled $21.6 billion in 2005, $15.2 billion in 2004 and $12.9 billion in 2003. Generally, factors that affect our earnings for example, pricing, volume, costs and productivity affect CFOA similarly. However, while management of working capital, including timing of collections and payments and levels of inventory, affects operating results only indirectly, the effect of these programs on CFOA can be significant. Excluding progress collections, working capital improvements benefited CFOA by $2.8 billion since 2002, as we applied our Lean Six Sigma and other working capital management tools broadly. Our GE Statement of Cash Flows shows CFOA in the required format. While that display is of some use in analyzing how various assets and liabilities affected our year end cash positions, we believe that it is also useful to supplement that display and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash. (52) December 31 (In billions) 2005 2004 2003 Operating cash collections $ 89.9 $ 81.6 $ 68.4 Operating cash payments (76.1 ) (69.5 ) (58.9 ) Cash dividends from GECS 7.8 3.1 3.4 GE cash from operating activities $ 21.6 $ 15.2 $ 12.9 The most significant source of cash in CFOA is customer related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale. GE operating cash collections increased by $8.3 billion during 2005 and by $13.2 billion during 2004. These increases are consistent with the changes in comparable GE operating segment revenues, comprising Healthcare, NBC Universal and the industrial businesses of the Industrial and Infrastructure segments, and which also reflect the effects of the second quarter 2004 acquisition of Amersham and combination of NBC and VUE. Analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding Segment Operations section is the best way of understanding their customer related CFOA. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for the wide range of material and services necessary in a diversified global organization. GE operating cash payments increased in 2005 by $6.6 billion and by $10.6 billion in 2004, comparable to the increases in GE total costs and expenses, and also reflect the second quarter 2004 acquisition of Amersham and combination of NBC and VUE. Dividends from GECS represented distribution of a portion of GECS retained earnings, including proceeds from certain business sales, and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses, which increased in 2005 by $0.8 billion to $20.9 billion and in 2004 by $6.1 billion to $20.1 billion. The amount we show in CFOA is the total dividend, including the normal dividend as well as any special dividends from excess capital primarily resulting from GECS business sales. Financial services cash is not necessarily freely available for alternative uses. For example, use of cash generated by our regulated activities is often restricted by such regulations. Further, any reinvestment in financing receivables is shown in cash used for investing activities, not operating activities. Therefore, maintaining or growing financial services assets requires that we invest much of the cash they generate from operating activities in their earning assets. Based on past performance and current expectations, in combination with the financial flexibility that comes with a strong balance sheet and the highest credit ratings, we believe that we are in a sound position to grow dividends, continue to execute our $25 billion share repurchase program, which is an expansion of the $15 billion share repurchase program announced in 2004, and continue making selective investments for long term growth. (53) Contractual Obligations As defined by reporting regulations, our contractual obligations for future payments as of December 31, 2005, follow. Payments due by period (In billions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011and thereafter Borrowings (note 18) $ 370.4 $ 158.2 $ 87.1 $ 45.5 $ 79.6 Interest on borrowings 66.0 12.0 18.0 10.0 26.0 Operating lease obligations (note 5) 6.8 1.4 2.2 1.5 1.7 Purchase obligations(a)(b) 58.0 37.0 13.0 4.0 4.0 Insurance liabilities (note 19)(c) 28.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 13.0 Other liabilities(d) 60.0 13.0 6.0 4.0 37.0 Contractual obligations of discontinued operations(e) 12.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 9.0 (a) Included all take or pay arrangements, capital expenditures, contractual commitments to purchase equipment that will be classified as equipment leased to others, software acquisition/license commitments, contractual minimum programming commitments and any contractually required cash payments for acquisitions. (b) Excluded funding commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business by our financial services businesses. Further information on these commitments and other guarantees is provided in note 29. (c) Included guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), structured settlements and single premium immediate annuities based on scheduled payouts, as well as those contracts with reasonably determinable cash flows such as deferred annuities, universal life, term life, long term care, whole life and other life insurance contracts. (d) Included an estimate of future expected funding requirements related to our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following non current liabilities are excluded from the table above: deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred revenue and other sundry items. See notes 21 and 27 for further information on certain of these items. (e) Included payments for borrowings and interest on borrowings of $3.6 billion, operating lease obligations of $0.2 billion, other liabilities of $2.8 billion, and insurance liabilities of $5.4 billion. Insurance liabilities primarily included workers compensation tabular indemnity loan and long term liability claims. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We use off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business to improve shareowner returns. These securitization transactions also serve as funding sources for a variety of diversified lending and securities transactions. Our securitization transactions are similar to those used by many financial institutions. In a typical securitization transaction, we sell assets to a special purpose entity (SPE), which has obtained cash by issuing beneficial interests, usually debt, to third parties. Securitization entities commonly use derivatives such as interest rate swaps to match interest rate characteristics of the assets with characteristics of the related beneficial interests. An example is an interest rate swap that serves to convert fixed rate assets to a variable rate, matching the cash flows on SPE floating rate debt. An investor in a beneficial interest usually has recourse to assets in the associated SPE, and often benefits from credit enhancements supporting those assets. The most common credit enhancement is overcollateralization, where we securitize a greater principal amount of assets than debt issued by the SPE. Our other credit enhancements are in the form of liquidity and credit support agreements and guarantee and reimbursement contracts. We have provided $0.1 billion at year end 2005 representing our best estimate of the fair value of potential losses under these arrangements. (54) Historically, we executed securitization transactions using entities sponsored by us and by third parties. Beginning in 2003, we only have executed securitization transactions with third parties in the asset backed commercial paper and term markets. Securitization entities hold receivables secured by equipment, commercial and residential real estate, credit card and trade receivables and other assets. Our total securitized assets at year end 2005 amounted to $61.7 billion, a $3.5 billion increase from year end 2004. Of that total, the off balance sheet amount was $43.8 billion, up $11.6 billion from December 31, 2004, and the amount in consolidated, liquidating securitization entities was $17.9 billion, down $8.1 billion from December 31, 2004, reflecting repayments. See note 28 for further information. We have extensive experience in evaluating economic, liquidity and credit risk related to the assets we securitize. Assets held by these entities are of high quality and we actively monitor them in accordance with our servicing role. We apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions and continuously monitor developments affecting credit. In view of our experience and taking into consideration the historical depth and liquidity of global commercial paper markets, we believe that, under any plausible future economic scenario, the likelihood is remote that the financial support arrangements we provide to securitization entities could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Debt Instruments, Guarantees and Covenants The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the debt of GE, GECS and GE Capital, the major borrowing affiliate of GECS. These agencies have given the highest debt ratings to GE and GE Capital (long term rating AAA/Aaa; short term rating A 1+/P 1). One of our strategic objectives is to maintain these ratings, as they serve to lower our cost of funds and to facilitate our access to a variety of lenders. We manage our businesses in a fashion that is consistent with maintaining these ratings. GE, GECS and GE Capital have distinct business characteristics that the major debt rating agencies evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative measures include: Earnings and profitability, revenue growth, the breadth and diversity of sources of income and return on assets, Asset quality, including delinquency and write off ratios and reserve coverage, Funding and liquidity, including cash generated from operating activities, leverage ratios such as debt to capital, market access, back up liquidity from banks and other sources, composition of total debt and interest coverage, and Capital adequacy, including required capital and tangible leverage ratios. Qualitative measures include: Franchise strength, including competitive advantage and market conditions and position, Strength of management, including experience, corporate governance and strategic thinking, and (55) Financial reporting quality, including clarity, completeness and transparency of all financial performance communications. GE Capitals ratings are supported contractually by a GE commitment to maintain the ratio of earnings to fixed charges at a specified level as described below. As of January 1, 2003, we extended a business specific, market based leverage to the performance measurement of each of our financial services businesses. As a result, at January 1, 2003, debt of $12.5 billion previously allocated to our financial services segments was allocated to Corporate items and eliminations. We refer to this as parent supported debt. As of December 31, 2004, $3.2 billion of such debt remained and was paid down during the first quarter of 2005. During 2005, GECS paid $3.9 billion of special dividends to GE, which was a portion of the proceeds from the Genworth secondary public offerings. During 2005, GE issued $1.5 billion of senior, unsecured three year floating rate debt. The proceeds were used primarily for repayment of maturing long term debt. During 2005, GECS and GECS affiliates issued $58 billion of senior, unsecured long term debt and $2 billion of subordinated debt. This debt was both fixed and floating rate and was issued to institutional and retail investors in the U.S. and 15 other global markets. Maturities for these issuances ranged from one to 40 years. We used the proceeds primarily for repayment of maturing long term debt, but also to fund acquisitions and organic growth. We anticipate that we will issue between $55 billion and $65 billion of additional long term debt during 2006, mostly to repay maturing long term debt. The ultimate amount we issue will depend on our needs and on the markets. Following is the composition of GECS debt obligations excluding any asset backed debt obligations, such as debt of consolidated, liquidating securitization entities. December 31 2005 2004 Senior notes and other long term debt 57 % 58 % Commercial paper 26 25 Current portion of long term debt 12 11 Other bank and other retail deposits 5 6 Total 100 % 100 % We target a ratio for commercial paper of 25% to 35% of outstanding debt based on the anticipated composition of our assets and the liquidity profile of our debt. GE Capital is the most widely held name in global commercial paper markets. We believe that alternative sources of liquidity are sufficient to permit an orderly transition from commercial paper in the unlikely event of impaired access to those markets. Funding sources on which we would rely would depend on the nature of such a hypothetical event, but include $57.2 billion of contractually committed lending agreements with 75 highly rated global banks and investment banks. Total credit lines extending beyond one year increased $0.3 billion to $57.1 billion at December 31, 2005. See note 18. (56) Beyond contractually committed lending agreements, other sources of liquidity include medium and long term funding, monetization, asset securitization, cash receipts from our lending and leasing activities, short term secured funding on global assets and potential sales of other assets. PRINCIPAL DEBT CONDITIONS are described below. The following two conditions relate to GE and GECS: Swap, forward and option contracts are required to be executed under master netting agreements containing mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require assignment or termination if the long term credit rating of either GE or GECS were to fall below A /A3. Had this provision been triggered at December 31, 2005, we could have been required to disburse $2.2 billion. If GE Capitals ratio of earnings to fixed charges, which was 1.70:1 at the end of 2005, as restated, were to deteriorate to 1.10:1 or, upon redemption of certain preferred stock, its ratio of debt to equity, which was 7.09:1 at the end of 2005, were to exceed 8:1, GE has committed to contribute capital to GE Capital. GE also has guaranteed certain issuances of subordinated debt of GECS with a face amount of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The following three conditions relate to consolidated, liquidating securitization entities: If the short term credit rating of GE Capital or certain consolidated, liquidating securitization entities discussed further in note 28 were to fall below A 1/P 1, GE Capital would be required to provide substitute liquidity for those entities or provide funds to retire the outstanding commercial paper. The maximum net amount that GE Capital would be required to provide in the event of such a downgrade is determined by contract, and amounted to $12.8 billion at January 1, 2006. Amounts related to non consolidated SPEs were $1.7 billion. If the long term credit rating of GE Capital were to fall below AA/Aa2, GE Capital would be required to provide substitute credit support or liquidate the consolidated, liquidating securitization entities. The maximum amount that GE Capital would be required to substitute in the event of such a downgrade is determined by contract, and amounted to $0.6 billion at December 31, 2005. For certain transactions, if the long term credit rating of GE Capital were to fall below A/A2 or BBB+/Baa1 or its short term credit rating were to fall below A 2/P 2, GE Capital could be required to provide substitute credit support or fund the undrawn commitment. GE Capital could be required to provide up to $2.0 billion in the event of such a downgrade based on terms in effect at December 31, 2005. One group of consolidated SPEs holds high quality investment securities funded by the issuance of GICs. If the long term credit rating of GE Capital were to fall below AA /Aa3 or its short term credit rating were to fall below A 1+/P 1, GE Capital could be required to provide up to $4.1 billion of capital to such entities. In our history, we have never violated any of the above conditions either at GE, GECS or GE Capital. We believe that under any reasonable future economic developments, the likelihood that any such arrangements could have a significant effect on our operations, cash flows or financial position is remote. (57) GES TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT expenditures were $3.4 billion in 2005, compared with $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, expenditures from GEs own funds were $2.7 billion compared with $2.4 billion in 2004. Expenditures funded by customers (mainly the U.S. government) were $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Expenditures reported above reflect the definition of research and development required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. For operating and management purposes, we consider amounts spent on product and services technology to include our reported research and development expenditures, but also amounts for improving our existing products and services, and the productivity of our plant, equipment and processes. On this basis, our technology expenditures in 2005 were $5.2 billion. GES TOTAL BACKLOG of firm unfilled orders at the end of 2005 was $36.1 billion, an increase of 6% from year end 2004, reflecting increased demand for wind turbines, locomotives and product services. Of the total backlog, $23.8 billion related to products, of which 70% was scheduled for delivery in 2006. Product services orders, included in this reported backlog for only the succeeding 12 months, were $12.3 billion at the end of 2005. Orders constituting this backlog may be canceled or deferred by customers, subject in certain cases to penalties. See the Segment Operations section for further information. Critical Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Also see note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. LOSSES ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. Such estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates, financial health of specific customers and market sectors, collateral values, and the present and expected future levels of interest rates. Our risk management process, which includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, ensures that relevant data are identified and considered either for individual loans or leases, or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate. Our lending and leasing experience and the extensive data we accumulate and analyze facilitate estimates that have proven reliable over time. Our actual loss experience was in line with expectations for 2005, 2004 and 2003. While prospective losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions, we do not anticipate significant adverse credit development in 2006. Further information is provided in the Financial Resources and Liquidity Financing Receivables section, the Asset Impairment section that follows and in notes 1, 13 and 14. (58) REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG TERM AGREEMENTS to provide product services (product services agreements) requires estimates of profits over the multiple year terms of such agreements, considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring, maintenance and overhaul events; the amount of personnel, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services; and future billing rate and cost changes. We routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. We also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions that affect a product services agreements total estimated profitability will also result in an immediate adjustment of earnings. We provide for probable losses. Carrying amounts for product services agreements in progress at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and are included in the line, Contract costs and estimated earnings in note 17. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on product services agreements have been insignificant for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005. Further information is provided in note 1. ASSET IMPAIRMENT assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows: INVESTMENTS. We regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value, the duration of that market decline, our intent and ability to hold to maturity or until forecasted recovery and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer. We perform comprehensive market research and analysis and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments. Further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the Financial Resources and Liquidity Investment Securities section and in notes 1 and 10. LONG LIVED ASSETS. We review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the assets residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as appropriate. (59) Commercial aircraft are a significant concentration of assets in Infrastructure, and are particularly subject to market fluctuations. Therefore, we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually. Additionally, we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are re leased, current lease terms have changed or a specific lessees credit standing changes. Future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers. Estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed. Fair value used to measure impairment is based on current market values from independent appraisers. We recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition to these impairment charges relating to operating leases, we recorded provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft of $0.2 billion in 2005, primarily related to Northwest Airlines Corporation (Northwest Airlines), and $0.3 billion in 2004, primarily related to US Airways and ATA Holdings Corp. Certain of our commercial aviation customers are operating under bankruptcy protection while they implement steps to return to profitable operations with a lower cost structure. At December 31, 2005, our largest exposures to carriers operating in bankruptcy were to Delta Air Lines, $2.4 billion; UAL Corp., $1.4 billion; and Northwest Airlines, $1.3 billion. Our financial exposures to these carriers are substantially secured by various Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier aircraft and operating equipment. On February 1, 2006, UAL Corp. emerged from bankruptcy protection. Further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the Operations Overview section and in notes 10, 15 and 29. GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit. Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we estimate using a discounted cash flow method. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. In applying this methodology, we rely on a number of factors, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections and market data. If this analysis indicates goodwill is impaired, measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset. In this case we supplement the cash flow approach discussed above with independent appraisals, as appropriate. We test other identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. Further information is provided in the Financial Resources and Liquidity Intangible Assets section and in notes 1 and 16. (60) PENSION ASSUMPTIONS are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments. We discount those cash payments using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. To reflect market interest rate conditions, we reduced our discount rate for principal pension plans at December 31, 2005, from 5.75% to 5.50% and at December 31, 2004, from 6.0% to 5.75%. To determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. Assets in our principal pension plans earned 10.2% in 2005 and had average annual earnings of 4.7%, 10.1% and 11.8% per year in the five, 10 and 25 year periods ended December 31, 2005, respectively. We believe that these results, in connection with our current and expected asset allocations, support our assumed long term return of 8.5% on those assets. Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans follows. Discount rate A 25 basis point reduction in discount rate would increase pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion. Expected return on assets A 50 basis point increase in the expected return on assets would decrease pension cost in the following year by $0.2 billion. Further information on our pension plans is provided in the Operations Overview section and in note 7. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. We use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity prices. Accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. The accounting guidance related to derivatives accounting is complex. Failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings, while offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item are reported in earnings only upon realization, regardless of whether the hedging relationship is economically effective. (61) In evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing. For a relationship that does not meet these criteria, we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly there after by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. This test is conducted on a cumulative basis each reporting period. If fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. Fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market based assumptions, subject to third party confirmation. At December 31, 2005, derivative assets and liabilities were $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. Further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1, 18 and 27. OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators. Further information is provided in notes 20 and 29. Other Information New Accounting Standard In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which will be effective for us on January 1, 2006. Among other things, SFAS 123R requires expensing the fair value of stock options, previously optional accounting that we adopted voluntarily in 2002. The transitional effect of this provision of SFAS 123R will be modest, consisting of a reduction in full year 2006 net earnings of $9 million to expense the unvested portion of options granted in 2001. SFAS 123R also will require us to change the classification of certain tax benefits from share based compensation deductions to financing rather than operating cash flows. While the effects of these future tax deductions will depend on several variables, had SFAS 123R been in effect, approximately $0.3 billion would have been required to be classified as financing, not operating, cash flows in both 2005 and 2004. Prior periods will not be restated as a result of this accounting change. Financial Measures that Supplement Generally Accepted Accounting Principles We sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered non GAAP financial measures under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, we have referred, in various sections of this Annual Report, to: Organic revenue growth in 2005 Growth in Industrial cash from operating activities (CFOA) in 2005 GE pre tax earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes excluding GECS earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes, and the corresponding effective tax rates, for the three years ended December 31, 2005 (62) Delinquency rates on certain financing receivables of the Commercial Finance and Consumer Finance segments for 2005, 2004 and 2003 Average total shareowners equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations, as reported and as restated The reasons we use these non GAAP financial measures and their reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow. Restated Organic Revenue Growth (In millions) 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) % Change GE consolidated revenues as reported $ 150,242 $ 134,999 11 % Less the effects of: Acquisitions, business dispositions (other than dispositions of businesses acquired for investment) and currency exchange rates 10,561 4,526 The 2004 Olympics broadcasts 927 The May 2005 SFAS 133 correction 503 GECS commercial paper interest rate swap adjustment(a) 540 518 GE consolidated revenues excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions (other than dispositions of businesses acquired for investment), currency exchange rates, the 2004 Olympics broadcasts, the May 2005 SFAS 133 correction and the GECS commercial paper interest rate swap adjustment (organic revenues) $ 139,141 $ 128,525 8 % (a) Refer to page 28 for a description of this adjustment. Growth in Industrial CFOA (In millions) 2005 2004 % change Cash from GEs operating activities as reported $ 21,609 $ 15,204 42 % Less GECS dividends 7,816 3,105 Cash from GEs operating activities excluding dividends from GECS (Industrial CFOA) $ 13,793 $ 12,099 14 % Restated GE Tax Rate, Excluding GECS Earnings (In millions) 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) GE earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, and accounting changes $ 21,383 $ 18,599 $ 16,948 Less GECS earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes 9,499 8,194 6,256 Total $ 11,884 $ 10,405 $ 10,692 GE provision for income taxes $ 2,750 $ 1,973 $ 2,857 GE effective tax rate, excluding GECS earnings 23.1 % 19.0 % 26.7 % (63) We believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat. In some cases, short term patterns and long term trends may be obscured by large factors or events. For example, events or trends in a particular segment may be so significant as to obscure patterns and trends of our industrial or financial services businesses in total. For this reason, we believe that investors may find it useful to see our 2005 revenue growth without the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, currency exchange rates, and the effects of the GECS commercial paper interest rate swap adjustment, and without the effects of the 2004 Olympics broadcasts and the May 2005 SFAS 133 correction which effects have no counterpart in 2005 and if included would overshadow trends in ongoing revenues. Similarly, we believe that investors would find it useful to compare our 2005 operating cash flow against our 2004 operating cash flow without the impact of GECS dividends. Delinquency Rates on Certain Financing Receivables Delinquency rates on managed Commercial Finance equipment loans and leases and managed Consumer Finance financing receivables follow. COMMERCIAL FINANCE December 31 2005 2004 2003 Managed 1.31 % 1.40 % 1.38 % Off book 0.76 0.90 1.27 On book 1.53 1.58 1.41 CONSUMER FINANCE December 31 2005 2004 2003 Managed 5.08 % 4.85 % 5.62 % Off book 5.28 5.09 5.04 On book 5.07 4.84 5.67 We believe that delinquency rates on managed financing receivables provide a useful perspective on our on and off book portfolio quality and are key indicators of financial performance. Average Total Shareowners Equity, Excluding Effects of Discontinued Operations(a) December 31 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Average total shareowners equity(b) as reported $ 111,683 $ 95,656 $ 71,336 $ 59,174 $ 52,674 Less: Cumulative effect of losses from discontinued operations(c) 3,094 2,980 925 1,007 226 Average net investment in discontinued operations(d) 4,620 Average total shareowners equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations(a) as reported $ 103,969 $ 92,676 $ 70,411 $ 58,167 $ 52,448 (64) December 31 (In millions) 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) 2001 (Restated) Average total shareowners equity(b) as restated $ 111,706 $ 95,711 $ 71,342 $ 59,154 $ 52,678 Less: Cumulative effect of losses from discontinued operations(c) 3,094 2,980 925 1,007 226 Average net investment in discontinued operations(d) 4,620 Average total shareowners equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations(a) as restated $ 103,992 $ 92,731 $ 70,417 $ 58,147 $ 52,452 (a) Used for computing return on average shareowners equity and return on average total capital invested shown on pages 26 and 27. (b) On an annual basis, calculated using a five point average. (c) Represented the average cumulative net earnings effects of discontinued operations from 2001 to 2005 (on an annual basis, calculated using a five point average). (d) Represented the average net investment in discontinued operations for the second half of 2005 only see below. U.S. GAAP requires earnings of discontinued operations to be displayed separately in the Statement of Earnings. Accordingly, the numerators used in our calculations of returns on average shareowners equity and average total capital invested presented in Selected Financial Data on pages 26 and 27 exclude those earnings (losses). Further we believe it is appropriate to exclude from the denominators, specifically the average total shareowners equity component, the cumulative effect of those earnings (losses) since 2000 for each of the five years for which such returns are presented, as well as our average net investment in discontinued operations for the second half of 2005 only. Had we disposed of these operations before mid 2005, proceeds would have been applied to reduce parent supported debt at GE Capital; however since parent supported debt at GE Capital was retired in the first half of 2005, we have assumed that any proceeds after that time would have been distributed to shareowners by means of share repurchases, thus reducing average total shareowners equity. Definitions indicating how the above named ratios are calculated using average total shareowners equity, excluding effects of discontinued operations, can be found on page 27. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See pages 51 and 52.
