ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Gilead was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987. We are an independent biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antivirals, antibacterials and antifungals to treat life threatening infectious diseases. We are a multinational company, with revenues from five approved products and marketing operations in ten countries. Currently, we market Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for the treatment of HIV infection, AmBisome&reg; ((amphotericin B) liposome for injection), an antifungal agent, DaunoXome&reg; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection), a drug approved for the treatment of Kaposis Sarcoma, and Vistide&reg; (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. Hoffmann La Roche Inc. markets Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment of influenza, under a collaborative agreement with Gilead. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our clinical development programs, internal discovery programs and an active product acquisition and in licensing strategy. Our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets, target screening and medicinal chemistry. In addition, we are currently developing products to treat hepatitis B virus and bacterial infections. We also have expertise in liposomal drug delivery technology that we use to develop drugs that are safer, easier for patients to tolerate and more effective. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a transaction valued at up to $200.0 million in cash and OSI stock. This transaction will allow us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. On February 22, 2001 and on March 8, 2002, Gilead completed two for one stock splits, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders of record as of February 2, 2001 and February 14, 2002, respectively. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect both of these splits. In the year ended December 31, 2001, Gilead adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 133 and 138, collectively referred to as SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. In the year ended December 31, 2000, Gilead adopted the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, also resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. 44  On July 29, 1999, Gilead entered into a business combination with NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NeXstar). The business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and the historical consolidated financial statements of Gilead for all periods prior to the business combination have been restated to include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of NeXstar. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors The following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Gileads actual results could differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section, as well as under the caption "Business," including "Risk Factors" in Part I. All forward looking statements included in this document are based on information currently available to Gilead, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. AmBisome Sales. We rely on sales of AmBisome for a significant portion of our operating income. There are lower priced products that compete with AmBisome; a product that was recently approved that competes with AmBisome, a product that the FDA has deemed approvable; and products being developed that could compete with AmBisome in the future. If these other products achieve further market acceptance, or if the products in development become commercially available, revenues from sales of AmBisome would likely decrease, resulting in a reduction of operating income. Viread Sales. In the future, we also expect to rely on sales of Viread for a portion of our operating income. A number of drugs to treat HIV infection and AIDS are currently sold or are in advanced stages of clinical development, including 17 products currently sold in the U.S. Among the companies that are significant competitors in the HIV/AIDS market are GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol Myers Squibb, Hoffmann La Roche, Pfizer, Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim and Abbott Laboratories. Given the broad range of competitors and depth of their resources, it is too early to determine if Viread will achieve significant market penetration, particularly for use in treatment na&iuml;ve patients given that the data supporting Vireads U.S. approval is in a treatment experienced patient population. Market Acceptance of Products. The ability of our products to achieve and sustain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including: the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals; the availability of public and private insurance and reimbursement for our products; the safety, efficacy, tolerability and cost of our products; and how our products compare to competitive products. If our products do not achieve and sustain market acceptance, our results of operations will suffer. Tamiflu is in a new class of drugs that represent a new approach to treating and preventing the flu. In order for Tamiflu to achieve market acceptance, our marketing partner, Roche, must change attitudes toward the treatment and prevention of influenza. Regulatory Process. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and foreign agencies could reject or limit the commercialization of our products for a number of reasons including: if they disagree with the results or designs of our clinical trials; if they believe our products have unacceptable efficacy, toxicity or tolerability; or if they believe our products cannot be safely and efficiently manufactured on a commercial basis. If these agencies reject or limit the commercialization of our products, our financial results would be adversely affected. The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products are extremely expensive, and it is difficult for us to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter. In addition, regulatory agencies could require us to conduct additional unanticipated clinical trials on our products, the cost of which could be substantial. 45 Medicaid and other Governmental Reimbursement and Discount Programs. Our business may be adversely affected by an increase in pricing pressures, both in the U.S. and abroad. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general. The U.S. has enacted legislation that requires us to pay a set rebate or offer a discount for our products that are reimbursed by Medicaid, purchased as outpatient medicines by certain Public Health Service entities and certain hospitals, or sold to certain other federal purchasers including the Veterans Administration. In recent years, new legislation has been proposed in the U.S. at the federal and state levels that would effect major changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the state level. These proposals have included prescription drug benefit proposals for Medicare beneficiaries introduced in Congress. Although there has been no U.S. federal reform legislation, some states have enacted health care reform legislation. Further federal and state developments are possible. Although we cannot predict the exact nature of legislative health care reforms, the results of our operations would be adversely affected if national or state governments require us to sell our marketed products at lower prices. Compulsory Licensing and Generic Competition. In a number of developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for HIV drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, sales of Viread in those countries could be reduced by generic competition. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of Viread in those countries, thereby reducing our Viread sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for Viread. In either case, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Collaborations. We depend on collaborations for the development and commercialization of certain products and for revenue, including the collaboration with Fujisawa for sales of AmBisome in the United States and Canada, the collaboration with Roche for sales of Tamiflu worldwide, and the collaboration with Cubist for the clinical development of Cidecin. These collaborations could fail for a number of reasons, including if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to the development, commercialization or marketing of our products, or if disputes arise with our partners. We will also seek additional collaborations. If our collaborations fail or if we are unable to establish additional collaborations, our financial results would be adversely affected. Foreign Currency Fluctuations. A significant majority of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. Dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. We did not in the past hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. Effective January 2002, we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the euro currency. We do hedge accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies, which minimizes but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable. Uncertain Financial Results. We expect that our financial results will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial. The fluctuations can be caused by 46 many factors that are beyond our control, including the risk factors listed above. We have never been profitable on a full year operating basis and we may never achieve or sustain operating profitability. As of December 31, 2001, our accumulated deficit was $453.7 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Gileads discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, accrued clinical and preclinical expenses, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Gilead believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, Medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from 24 months for Viread up to 36 months for AmBisome in the U.S. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer customer incentives. Each action could result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We write down our inventory based on quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. Management accrues costs for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates that 25% to 30% of the work is for upfront costs with the remaining activity generally on a straight line basis over the life of the individual contract or study. This estimate may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible, however, if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods. 47 Results of Operations Revenues We had total revenue of $233.8 million for the year 2001, $195.6 million for the year 2000 and $169.0 million for the year 1999. Included in total revenue are net product sales, royalty income and contract revenue, including revenue from research and development (R&D) collaborations. Net product sales revenue was $191.0 million for 2001, compared with $149.7 million for 2000 and $139.9 million for 1999. Our revenues have been primarily derived from sales of AmBisome, which represented 86% of total product sales in 2001, 94% of total product sales in 2000 and 92% of total product sales in 1999. Reported sales of AmBisome were $164.5 million in 2001, an increase of 17% over AmBisome sales of $141.1 million in 2000. Excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in 2001, sales of AmBisome in 2001 would have increased 20%. A significant majority of Gileads product sales is denominated in foreign currencies. We did not in the past hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. Effective January 2002, we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the euro currency. We do hedge accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected. Sales of AmBisome were $129.2 million in 1999. Excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in 2000, sales of AmBisome in 2000 would have increased 21% versus 1999 reported sales. With the expected increase in competition, we would expect AmBisome sales for 2002 to remain relatively flat versus 2001 reported levels. This assumes foreign currency exchange rates remain at consistent levels throughout 2002 when compared to 2001. In 2001, we also recognized $15.6 million in Viread sales, representing 8% of total product sales. Sales of DaunoXome and Vistide were $4.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively, in 2001. In 2000, Gilead recognized product sales revenue of $4.4 million from sales of DaunoXome and $4.2 million from sales of Vistide. In 1999, DaunoXome sales were $4.8 million and Vistide sales were $5.9 million. We expect Viread sales to increase in 2002 and become a greater percentage of total revenues although we cannot predict with any certainty what our actual Viread sales will be in 2002. We recorded royalty revenue of $23.0 million in 2001, compared with $24.6 million in 2000 and $10.4 million in 1999. During this three year period, the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of AmBisome in the United States by Fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with Gilead. During the fourth quarter of 1999, we began recognizing royalty revenues from Fujisawas sales of AmBisome in the month following that in which the related product sales occur. Prior to the fourth quarter of 1999, we recognized this royalty revenue in the month the sales occurred. Royalty revenue from Fujisawa was $17.1 million in 2001, compared with $13.5 million in 2000 and $8.3 million in 1999. The 1999 amount represents royalties from 11 months of Fujisawa sales of AmBisome. We also recorded royalty revenue of $4.5 million in 2001 and $9.6 million in 2000 related to sales of Tamiflu. Tamiflu is an orally administered compound developed to treat and prevent viral influenza in humans. Gilead co developed Tamiflu with F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann La Roche Inc. (collectively, Roche). Roche owns the worldwide commercial rights to Tamiflu, and is required to pay Gilead a royalty on net sales of the product. In October 1999, the FDA approved Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults, and Roche began selling the product commercially. We record royalty revenue from Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which the related Tamiflu sales occur. Accordingly, Gilead began recognizing royalties from Tamiflu in the first quarter of 2000. The significant declines in royalty revenue can be attributed to the significantly lower incidence of flu for the 2000/2001 season and the resulting product returns to Roche. We expect Tamiflu royalties to increase somewhat in 2002 as a result of broader market penetration. During the second half of 2000, Tamiflu was approved in the U.S. for the prevention in adults and as a treatment for influenza in 48 children, and approved in Japan as a treatment for influenza in adults. As of February 2001, Roche has filed for European regulatory approval of Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults. It is unclear when and if this approval will be granted. Substantially all of the remaining net royalty revenue recognized in 2001, 2000 and 1999 represents royalties from sales of Vistide by Pharmacia S.A. (Pharmacia) outside the United States. In future periods, royalties from sales of Vistide are expected to be relatively flat or decline slightly. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Among other things, SAB 101 describes the SEC Staffs position on the recognition of certain nonrefundable up front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements. We previously recognized nonrefundable technology access fees received in connection with collaboration agreements as revenue when received or when collectibility was probable, and when the technology had been transferred. Effective January 1, 2000, we changed our method of accounting for these fees to recognize them as the related manufacturing obligation is fulfilled or on a straight line basis over the term of the related research and development collaboration, manufacturing or supply arrangement, as appropriate, as this method best matches the effort provided. We believe the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in SAB 101. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactively effective as of January 1, 2000, as deferred revenue that will be recognized as contract revenue over the remaining term of the research and development, manufacturing or supply arrangements, as appropriate. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the impact of the cumulative change in accounting principle was to increase the net loss by $13.7 million. We recognized additional contract revenue of $3.5 million in 2001 and $2.9 million in 2000, in accordance with SAB 101, related to up front fees which had been received in prior years. The $3.5 million recognized in 2001 was related to two collaborative relationships: $2.9 million related to an initial licensing fee from Sumitomo and $0.6 million related to an initial license fee from Pharmacia. The $2.9 million recognized in 2000 was related to three collaborative arrangements: $1.6 million from Sumitomo; $0.6 million from Pharmacia; and $0.7 million related to an initial licensing fee from Roche. The remaining $7.3 million of SAB 101 related deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 results from the Sumitomo and Pharmacia collaborations, and is expected to be recognized as contract revenue over the next eleven years. There is no remaining deferred revenue related to the Roche initial license fee as of December 31, 2001. Total contract revenue was $19.8 million in 2001, compared with $21.3 million in 2000 and $18.7 million in 1999. The primary source of contract revenue in 2001 was from our licensing of the SELEX process patent estate to Archemix. This provided $8.5 million of contract revenue in 2001. Other sources of contract revenue in 2001 include a $2.0 million milestone payment from Roche relating to the development of Tamiflu under an R&D collaboration agreement between Gilead and Roche and $3.3 million recognized for work associated with marketing agreements. The single most significant source of contract revenue in 2000 and 1999 was milestone payments from Roche under the R&D collaboration agreement. We recorded contract revenue from Roche of $11.2 million in 2000 and $14.9 million in 1999. The $11.2 million of contract revenue from Roche in 2000 included $9.6 million in milestone payments related to Roche completing regulatory filings and approvals for Tamiflu in the U.S. and Japan, $0.9 million of R&D expense reimbursements, and $0.7 million resulting from the adoption of SAB 101 as discussed above. The 1999 amount included $12.8 million of milestone payments and $2.1 million of R&D reimbursements. R&D reimbursements from Roche in 2001 decreased compared to 2000, and reimbursements in 2000 similarly decreased relative to 1999, as Tamiflu development efforts ramped down while Roches commercialization activities increased. As of December 31, 2001, Gilead is entitled to additional milestone payments of up to $9.6 million upon Roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones. While we may earn milestone payments under the Roche agreement in 2002, we expect expense reimbursements under the Roche 49 agreement to be minimal in 2002. Such reimbursements, if any, will approximate our actual related costs incurred. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement with Archemix Corporation relating to our SELEX technology. Under this agreement, we gave Archemix the exclusive rights to the SELEX process, including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre existing agreements. Archemix paid to us $9.0 million in 2001 and is required to pay us $8.5 million in 2002. As required by our license agreement with the University Technology Corporation, we paid 5% of the $9.0 million payment to, and will pay 5% of the $8.5 million payment to, the University Technology Corporation. We also received a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of Archemix common stock, the value of which is not material. As required by our license agreement with the University Technology Corporation, we transferred 5% of this warrant to the University Technology Corporation. In March 2000, we entered into an agreement with EyeTech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. relating to Gileads proprietary aptamer EYE001, formerly known as NX 1838. Currently in early clinical trials, EYE001 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, EyeTech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of EYE001, and, if the product is successfully commercialized, EyeTech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product. EyeTech also will be responsible for all research and development costs. We provided clinical supplies of the product to EyeTech through March 2001. We received a $7.0 million up front licensing fee from EyeTech in April 2000, which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period. Accordingly, $5.2 million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in 2000, and the remainder recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2001. We are also entitled to additional cash payments from EyeTech of up to $25.0 million if and when EyeTech reaches certain EYE001 development milestones. Additionally, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of EyeTech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share, the price at which the stock was issued to other investors. In November 1999, Gilead and Somalogic, Inc. entered into an agreement under which Gilead assigned to Somalogic a sole and exclusive license to certain intellectual property, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the agreement, Somalogic was required to pay Gilead a total of $2.5 million in two nonrefundable installments. The second installment totaled $1.0 million and was received in November 2000 and recorded as contract revenue upon receipt. The first installment of $1.5 million was received and recognized as contract revenue in November 1999. Cost and Expenses Cost of goods sold was $43.8 million in 2001, compared with $33.5 million in 2000 and $29.5 million in 1999. As a percentage of net product sales, cost of goods sold was 23% in 2001, 22% in 2000 and 21% in 1999. In connection with most of our European product sales, we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold (Payment Currencies). A significant majority of our manufacturing cost is in U.S. Dollars. A decline in the value of the Payment Currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar will negatively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues, which are reported in U.S. Dollars, will decline. In 2001 and 2000, the gross margin was negatively impacted by these factors, as discussed in the product sales section under the caption "Revenues" above. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates on reported sales revenue, cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales would have been approximately 22% in 2001, consistent with 2000 levels. Our cost of sales percentage on an annual basis has been in the 20% to 23% range in recent years. Except for the potential impact of unpredictable 50 and uncontrollable changes in Payment Currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, we expect the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales in 2002 to remain materially consistent with the 2001 rate. In future years, changes in the nature or mix of our product sales, such as the recent commercial launch of Viread for HIV infection, could impact this relationship. In 2001 and 2000, research and development (R&D) expenses exceeded 50% of our total costs and expenses. In 1999, R&D expenses represented approximately 46% of our total costs and expenses. The major components of R&D expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase I, II, and III clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. During 2001, we spent approximately $37.2 million on research, $117.6 million on clinical development and $30.8 million on pharmaceutical development activities. This compares to spending in 2000 of approximately $27.0 million on research, $78.9 million on clinical development and $26.4 million on pharmaceutical development activities. Spending in 1999 consisted of $27.3 million on research, $59.8 million on clinical development and $23.8 million on pharmaceutical development activities. In total, R&D expenses for 2001 were $185.6 million, compared with $132.3 million for 2000 and $110.9 million for 1999. The $53.3 million increase in spending in 2001 versus 2000 was attributable in part to the recognition of $10.6 million of a $13.0 million up front payment and $5.5 million of clinical milestone payments to Cubist under the European licensing agreement for Cidecin. In addition, our expenses associated with the Phase III clinical trials and expanded access programs for Viread for HIV infection and the Phase III clinical programs for adefovir dipivoxil for HBV infection increased approximately $18.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively, during the year. Based on current budgeted programs, we expect R&D expenses in 2002 to be approximately $140 million to $150 million, or 15% to 25% lower than 2001, reflecting the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in December 2001 and the decreasing levels of activity associated with the U.S. and European expanded access programs for Viread. As a result of this expected decrease, R&D spending as a percentage of our total costs and expenses is expected to be below 50%. R&D spending levels for 2000 also increased over 1999 levels. Major development projects in 2000 included Viread and adefovir dipivoxil for HBV infection. We incurred increased costs for both of these programs which were in Phase III clinical trials. Additionally, we made up front payments in the fourth quarter of 2000 to in license two oncology products from Glaxo Smith Kline and Southern Research Institute, the rights to both of which have been subsequently assigned to OSI as part of the sale of our oncology assets in December 2001. These increases more than offset significantly lower expenses in 2000 for the development of adefovir dipivoxil for HIV infection, a program we discontinued in the fourth quarter of 1999. Additionally, in 1999, we reduced the R&D workforce in Boulder by 30 employees upon completing the merger with NeXstar. Recent industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical product generally takes 10 to 15 years (an average of 12 years) to research, develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the U.S. These averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally, although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis. Drug development in the U.S. is a process that includes several steps defined by the FDA. The process begins with the filing of an Initial Drug Application (or IND) which, if successful, allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase I, II, and III, and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drugs total development time. The most significant costs associated with clinical development are the Phase III trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We currently have products 51 in development that are in Phase III studies. The successful development of our products is highly uncertain. An estimation of completion dates and R&D expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development products, see the "Risk Factors" section of Item I above. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $125.1 million in 2001, compared with $82.0 million in 2000 and $99.4 million in 1999. The increase in expenses in 2001 versus 2000 is primarily due to Gileads increased global marketing efforts and the expansion of our sales force to support the commercial launch of Viread for HIV infection. In 2002, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $180 million to $190 million, or 45% to 55% higher than 2001 levels, primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the launch of Viread in the U.S. and European Union, but also our preparation for the commercial launch of adefovir dipivoxil for HBV infection. The major factor contributing to the decrease in 2000 SG&A expenses from 1999 levels was the inclusion of $18.3 million of merger related expenses in 1999. These merger related expenses primarily consisted of transaction costs, including professional fees, filing fees and printing costs; employee severance costs; and the write down of certain NeXstar property and equipment that was not expected to be used in future operations. Total employee severance costs of $5.3 million relate to the termination of 70 employees, the majority of which were from our Boulder, Colorado facility. Excluding merger expenses, SG&A expenses in 2000 were essentially flat compared with 1999. Higher general and administrative (G&A) expenses in 2000 were offset by savings in sales and marketing expenses. The increased G&A spending in 2000 included costs to implement new and upgraded information technology systems and legal costs incurred in connection with new collaboration agreements and various corporate projects. Sales and marketing expenses in 2000 reflect cost savings in the U.S. from the elimination in the second half of 1999 of duplicate positions and functions within the combined Gilead and NeXstar organization. Sales and marketing expenses in 1999 included costs to expand our sales and marketing capacity in anticipation of the then planned commercial launch of adefovir dipivoxil for HIV infection, which was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 1999. Litigation Settlement and Related Expenses We incurred litigation settlement and related expenses of $1.3 million in 2001, $1.4 million in 2000 and $1.5 million 1999. In 1997 we reached a settlement with Elan Corporation, plc (Elan, the successor company to The Liposome Company) in which both companies agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings involving AmBisome, Gileads liposomal formulation of amphotericin B. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we made an initial payment to Elan of $1.8 million and are required to make additional payments through 2006, based on AmBisome sales. The payments are subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts. A $10.0 million accounting charge was recorded in 1997 representing the net present value of all future minimum payments we are required to make. We record an expense each quarter based on the difference between all future minimum payments and the amount previously accrued. These amounts have not been significant. We do not expect the difference between the future minimum and maximum payments to Elan to be material. Gain on Sale of Oncology Assets In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets, pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property, as well as our Boulder, Colorado operations, including clinical research and drug development personnel, infrastructure and facilities, to OSI. The pipeline of clinical candidates includes NX 211 (liposomal lurtotecan), GS 7836 (a nucleoside analogue) and GS 7904L (a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor). On the closing date, we received $130.0 million in cash and OSI common stock valued at approximately $38.8 million. The Company recorded a non operating gain of $157.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of this transaction. In addition, we recorded income taxes of $3.3 million in connection with this transaction. 52  Gain on Sale of Unconsolidated Affiliate In August 2001, we also sold our 49 percent interest in Proligo L.L.C. (Proligo) to Degussa Corporation for $14.3 million in cash. Proligo was a joint venture between Gilead and SKW Americas, Inc. focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides. SKW Americas, a subsidiary of Degussa Corporation, held the remaining 51 percent of Proligo. The proceeds, net of Gileads investment in Proligo, are reflected as an $8.8 million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate. Interest Income and Interest Expense We recorded interest income of $25.6 million in 2001, compared with $17.6 million in 2000 and $16.4 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 over 2000 was due to higher average balances of invested funds. In December 2000, we received approximately $241.8 million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes, net of debt issuance costs. The increase in 2000 over 1999 was due to higher interest rates on our investment portfolio. We expect interest income in 2002 to be materially consistent with 2001 levels due to the receipt of $130 million in cash from the sale of our oncology assets in December 2001, offset by lower interest rates on our portfolio of fixed income securities. We incurred interest expense of $14.0 million in 2001, compared with $4.4 million in 2000 and $6.5 million in 1999. The significant increase in 2001 over 2000 is due to the full year of interest on our $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes. Interest expense for 2000 consisted primarily of interest on the $79.5 million 6.25% convertible notes, which were converted to common stock in August 2000. The decrease in 2000 from 1999 levels occurred primarily because of the August 2000 debt conversion. Interest expense for 1999 included a full year of interest on the $79.5 million 6.25% convertible notes. We expect interest expense in 2002 to remain consistent with 2001 expense levels as we again incur a full year of expense on the $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $4.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In all periods, we recorded income tax expense associated with income from our foreign subsidiaries. The significant increase in income tax expense in 2001 resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to OSI, for which we recorded approximately $3.3 million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes. Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliate In 2001, we recorded $2.1 million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate, Proligo, prior to the date of the sale of our 49 percent interest. In 2000, we recorded $2.9 million as our equity in the loss of Proligo. This represented our 49 percent share of Proligos loss for the thirteen month period ended December 31, 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Proligo changed its fiscal year end to December 31 from November 30. For 1999, we recorded $4.7 million equity in the loss of Proligo for its fiscal year ended November 30, 1999. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In the year ended December 31, 2001, Gilead adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $1.1 million. In the year ended December 31, 2000, Gilead adopted the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of ($13.7) million. See Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 53 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $582.9 million at December 31, 2001, up from $512.9 million at December 31, 2000. The increase of $70.0 million was primarily due to the $130.0 million cash and $38.8 million in OSI common stock received as part of the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in December 2001. Other major sources and uses of cash included proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of $36.3 million and proceeds of $14.3 million from the sale of our interest in Proligo, offset by capital expenditures of $26.3 million and cash used to fund our operating activities. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2001 was $74.2 million compared to $48.8 million at December 31, 2000. The growth was primarily due to the year over year increase in net product sales for AmBisome and also the initial sales of Viread in the U.S. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2001, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled approximately $28.7 million, of which approximately $9.9 million was more than 120 days past due. At December 31, 2000, past due receivables for these countries were $19.3 million, of which approximately $10.9 million was more than 120 days past due. To date, we have experienced only modest losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that all past due accounts receivable, including those due from customers in these four countries, are collectible. We continually seek to improve our collection processes to ensure that we fully collect amounts due to us based on our product sales and that collections are timely. Significant changes in working capital during 2001 included an $18.7 million increase in inventory. In addition, accounts payable increased $8.5 million as a result of an increase in our raw material purchases and the increased use of contract manufacturers. Substantially all of this growth in inventory and accounts payable is in support of the recent U.S. and European launch of Viread. Other changes in working capital include an increase in accrued liabilities of $11.5 million. Accrued clinical and preclinical expenses increased by $6.0 million, primarily due to the advanced and accelerated Phase III clinical trials for adefovir dipivoxil for HBV infection. Accrued compensation has also increased from $10.0 million at December 31, 2000 to $14.7 million at December 31, 2001, principally due to the expansion of our sales force in support of the Viread launch. Other accrued liabilities increased $5.5 million in 2001, consisting principally of transaction costs and income taxes payable arising from the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. Other noncurrent assets decreased $4.9 million to $24.2 million at December 31, 2001 from $29.1 million at December 31, 2000. The decrease was due to the sale of our 49 percent interest in Proligo. Our investment in Proligo at December 31, 2000 was approximately $6.9 million and approximately $4.8 million as of the date of the sale. The decrease was partially offset by increases resulting from the $2.4 million unrecognized portion of the $13.0 million license fee payment to Cubist and the $1.1 million valuation of a warrant to purchase stock in EyeTech recognized in accordance with SFAS 133. The $2.4 million balance resulting from the Cubist payment is included in other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2001 because if, prior to January 2002, Gilead terminated its rights under the agreement with respect to a preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin being developed by Cubist, or if Cubist discontinued development of that oral formulation, Gilead would have been entitled to receive a refund of this amount from Cubist. We made capital expenditures of $26.3 million in 2001, $15.6 million in 2000 and $12.5 million in 1999. These expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth, as 54 well as for laboratory and manufacturing equipment. Of the $26.3 million spent in 2001, approximately 50% to 60% was research and development related. We expect our capital spending for 2002 to decrease somewhat compared with 2001 levels, however the percentage allocated for research and development should remain consistent with the previous year. In August 2000, we redeemed our 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures at a cash price of $1,030 per $1,000 principal amount of debentures outstanding, plus accrued interest, which was the redemption price provided for in the original debenture indenture. Upon redemption, the entire $79.5 million in principal amount of the debentures outstanding at that time was converted into 7,135,156 newly issued shares of Gilead common stock by August 15, 2000. Deferred debt issuance costs of $1.6 million related to the debentures were charged to additional paid in capital in connection with the conversion of the debentures into common stock. On December 13, 2000, we issued $250.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes are currently convertible into a total of up to 10,178,116 shares of Gilead common stock at $24.5625 per share. The $24.5625 conversion price was higher than our common stock price at the notes issuance date. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on or after December 20, 2003, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs of $8.2 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets, and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes. Through April 2001, we maintained a $10.0 million unsecured line of credit that bears interest at a floating rate with a major financial institution. Under the terms of the line of credit, we were required to maintain certain financial ratios and there were limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or to engage in certain significant transactions. The line of credit, which included a foreign exchange facility, expired in April 2001. We renewed the foreign exchange facility through April 2002, but did not renew the line of credit. There are no required financial ratios or limitations on debt or other transactions under the foreign exchange facility. We do not have any "special purpose" entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements. We are also not involved in any non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value. We have no commercial commitments with related parties, except for employee loans. We have contractual obligations in the form of a litigation settlement, capital and operating leases, notes payable and clinical research organization contracts. We believe that our existing capital resources, which includes all fixed income and equity securities, supplemented by net product sales and contract and royalty revenues, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the commercial performance of AmBisome, Viread and any of our products in development that receive marketing approval, the progress of our research and development efforts, the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, the rate of technological advances, determinations as to the commercial potential of our products under development, administrative expenses, the status of competitive products, 55  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements, the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities, our possible geographic expansion, and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners. If such funding is required, we cannot assure you that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). SFAS 141 eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to July 1, 2001. SFAS 141 further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill. The requirements of SFAS 141 are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after June 30, 2001. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. As we have not accounted for any business combinations under the purchase method of accounting, the adoption of SFAS 141 on July 1, 2001 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations and the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144 establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired. SFAS 144 retains the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement, but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and the interim periods within. The adoption of SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Market Risk Disclosures Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States as well as sales activities in Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British Pound and the Australian Dollar. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. Dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. 56 To mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2001. The contracts have maturities of one year or less with one exception. One hedge contract intended to hedge raw materials purchases in the first quarter of 2003, with a notional amount of $3.7 million and an insignificant fair value at December 31, 2001, has a maturity of 13 months. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per U.S. Dollar. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2001 (notional amounts and fair values in $U.S. thousands): Currency Notional Amount Average Rate Fair Value December 31, 2001 Australian Dollar $ 1,260 1.9724 $ (6 ) British Pound 7,548 0.6918 (38 ) Danish Krone 46 8.4844 (1 ) Euro 63,187 1.1335 (875 ) Norwegian Krone 150 9.1105 (3 ) Swiss Franc 122 1.6910 (2 ) A significant majority of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. Dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. We did not in the past hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. Effective January 2002, we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the euro currency. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to the investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: 1.Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; 2.Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and 3.Competitive after tax rate of return. 57 The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest bearing assets and fixed rate liabilities at December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands).
