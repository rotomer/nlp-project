ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Gilead was incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987. We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antivirals, antibacterials and antifungals to treat life threatening infectious diseases. We are a multinational company, with revenues from six approved products and marketing operations in ten countries. Currently, we market Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for the treatment of HIV infection; Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection; AmBisome ((amphotericin B) liposome for injection), an antifungal agent; DaunoXome (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection), a drug approved for the treatment of Kaposis Sarcoma; and Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of CMV retinitis. Roche markets Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment of influenza, under a collaborative agreement with us. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our clinical development programs, internal discovery programs and an active product acquisition and in licensing strategy, such as our acquisition of Triangle completed in January 2003. Our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets, target screening and medicinal chemistry. In addition, we are currently developing products to treat HIV and HBV infections. We also have expertise in liposomal drug delivery technology that we use to develop drugs that are safer, easier for patients to tolerate and more effective. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a transaction valued at up to $200.0 million in cash and OSI stock. This transaction will allow us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. In the year ended December 31, 2001, Gilead adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 133 and 138, collectively referred to as SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. In the year ended December 31, 2000, Gilead adopted the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, also resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors The following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Gileads actual results could differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section, as well as under the caption "Business", including "Risk Factors That Affect Gilead" in Part I. All forward looking statements included in this document are based on information currently available to Gilead, do not include the effect of the acquisition of Triangle in our 2003 guidance, unless specifically noted, since we are still evaluating the detailed financial impact of Triangles operations on our consolidated financial statements, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. Viread Sales. We rely on sales of Viread for a significant portion of our operating income. A number of drugs to treat HIV infection and AIDS are currently sold or are in advanced stages of clinical development, including 20 products currently sold in the U.S. Among the companies that are significant competitors in the HIV/AIDS market are GSK, BMS, Roche, Pfizer, Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim and Abbott Laboratories. Given the broad range of competitors and depth of their 41 resources, Vireads market penetration may be limited, particularly for use in treatment na&iuml;ve patients, given that the data supporting Vireads U.S. approval is in a treatment experienced patient population. AmBisome Sales. We also rely on sales of AmBisome for a significant portion of our operating income. There are lower priced products that compete with AmBisome; two products that compete with AmBisome that were recently approved in the U.S. and European Union; and products being developed that could compete with AmBisome in the future. If any of these antifungal products achieve further market acceptance, or if the antifungal products in development become commercially available, revenues from sales of AmBisome would likely decrease, resulting in a reduction of operating income. Acquisition Integration. In January 2003, we completed the acquisition of Triangle. Any acquisition carries inherent risks. We may not be able to successfully integrate Triangle into our operations and obtain any anticipated synergies or cost savings. We may also be unsuccessful in obtaining marketing approval for emtricitabine or in developing a co formulated product. Failure to successfully integrate the Triangle operations into our business or obtain marketing approval of emtricitabine could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Market Acceptance of Products. The ability of our products to achieve and sustain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals; the availability of public and private insurance and reimbursement for our products; the safety, efficacy, tolerability and cost of our products; ease of administration and dosing, and how our products compare to competitive products. If our products do not achieve and sustain market acceptance, our results of operations will suffer. Regulatory Process. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and foreign agencies could reject or limit the commercialization of our products for a number of reasons including: if they disagree with the results or designs of our clinical trials; if they believe our products have unacceptable efficacy, toxicity or tolerability; or if they believe our products cannot be manufactured on a commercial basis in compliance with the applicable safety and quality standards. If these agencies reject or limit the commercialization of our products, our financial results would be adversely affected. The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products are extremely expensive, and it is difficult for us to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter. In addition, regulatory agencies could require us to conduct additional unanticipated clinical trials on our products, the cost of which could be substantial. Governmental Legislation and Reimbursement Programs. Regulatory, legal and legislative issues may adversely affect pricing and sales of our products. In the U.S., there is federal legislation that lowers the price for our products that are purchased or reimbursed by federal agencies, and some states have enacted legislation that can lower the prices for our products. In addition, there are a growing number of U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that if enacted would lower the price for our products. Many countries outside the U.S. have government sponsored health care programs that set lower drug prices and patient reimbursement levels. Our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those countries from lower price markets. This is of particular concern in the European Union where we are required to permit cross border sales and could be a concern in the U.S. if legislation easing import restrictions is enacted and applied. International Credit Risk. We are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to European product sales. Our European product sales to government owned or supported customers in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected. 42 Compulsory Licensing and Generic Competition. In a number of developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for HIV infection available at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for HIV drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, sales of Viread in those countries could be reduced by generic competition. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of Viread in those countries, thereby reducing our Viread sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for Viread. In all of these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Collaborations. We depend on collaborations for the development and commercialization of certain products and for revenue, including the collaboration with Fujisawa for sales of AmBisome in the U.S. and Canada, the collaboration with GSK for clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in Asia, Latin America and certain other territories, and the collaboration with Roche for sales of Tamiflu worldwide. We may also seek additional collaborations. These collaborations could fail for a number of reasons, including if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to the development, commercialization or marketing of our products, or if disputes arise with our partners. If these existing collaborations fail, our financial results would be adversely affected. Foreign Currency Fluctuations. A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. Prior to January 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. Effective January 2002, we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. We do hedge a portion of our accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies, which minimizes but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable. Uncertain Financial Results. We expect that our financial results will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial. The fluctuations can be caused by many factors that are beyond our control, including the risk factors listed above. As of December 31, 2002, our accumulated deficit was $381.6 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Gileads discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, accrued clinical and preclinical expenses, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of 43 assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. Gilead believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, Medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives, such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for Medicaid reimbursements and cash discounts are based on contractual terms and expectations regarding the utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from 24 months for Viread up to 36 months for AmBisome in the U.S. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on the government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We write down our inventory based on quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required. We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. Management accrues costs for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates that, generally, 25% to 30% of the work is for up front costs with the remaining activity occurring on a straight line basis over the life of the individual contract or study. This estimate may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible, however, if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, we would have to record additional research and development expenses in future periods that could be significant. Results of Operations Revenues We had total revenue of $466.8 million in 2002, $233.8 million in 2001 and $195.6 million in 2000. Included in total revenue are net product sales, royalty income and contract revenue, including revenue from research & development (R&D) and manufacturing collaborations. Net product sales revenue was $423.9 million for 2002, compared with $191.0 million for 2001 and $149.7 million for 2000. Product sales increased 122% in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to 44 significant increases in sales of Viread, which was approved for sale in the U.S. in October 2001 and the European Union in February 2002. A significant percentage of Gileads product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. Effective January 2002, we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales which will reduce, but not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. Losses on these revenue hedges reduced product revenues by $1.0 million in 2002. Sales of Viread in 2002 were $225.8 million in 2002, or 53% of total product sales, compared to $15.6 million, or 8% of total product sales in 2001. Of the Viread sales in 2002, $167.0 million were U.S. sales and $58.8 million were international sales. With the continued market expansion of Viread, we expect Viread sales in 2003 to approximately double and be in the range of $425 million to $475 million. Sales of AmBisome were $185.7 million in 2002, an increase of 13% over AmBisome sales of $164.5 million in 2001. Sales of AmBisome were $141.1 million in 2000. Prior to 2002, our revenues have been primarily derived from sales of AmBisome, which represented 44% of total product sales in 2002, 86% of total product sales in 2001 and 94% of total product sales in 2000. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, AmBisome sales grew 9% for the year ended December 31, 2002 over the comparable period in 2001. The increase in sales in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to volume sales increases in Europe, which offset declining sales in the U.S. The increase in sales in 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily due to volume and price increases in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in 2001, sales of AmBisome in 2001 would have increased 20%. With the expected increase in competition, we expect AmBisome sales for 2003 to be lower than 2002 and in the range of $160 million to $170 million. We recorded royalty revenue of $20.4 million in 2002, compared with $23.0 million in 2001 and $24.6 million in 2000. During this three year period, the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of AmBisome in the U.S. by Fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with us. Royalty revenue from Fujisawa was $15.7 million in 2002, compared with $17.1 million in 2001 and $13.5 million in 2000. We also recorded royalty revenue of $3.4 million in 2002, $4.5 million in 2001 and $9.6 million in 2000 related to sales of Tamiflu. Tamiflu is an orally administered compound developed to treat and prevent viral influenza in humans. Gilead co developed Tamiflu with Roche, which owns the worldwide commercial rights to Tamiflu, and is required to pay us a royalty on net sales of the product. We began recognizing royalties from Tamiflu in the first quarter of 2000. In June 2002, Roche received European regulatory approval of Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, we record royalty revenue one quarter in arrears. Total contract revenue was $22.5 million in 2002, compared with $19.8 million in 2001 and $21.3 million in 2000. In 2002 and 2001 a primary source of contract revenue was from our licensing of the SELEX process patent estate to Archemix, which, due to collectibility concerns, we recognized on a cash basis. This provided $8.1 million of contract revenue in 2002 and $8.6 million in 2001. In 2002, Roche made milestone payments of $8.0 million for the European prophylaxis and treatment approvals of Tamiflu, and in 2001 made a $2.0 million milestone payment relating to the development of Tamiflu under an R&D collaboration agreement. In 2000, contract revenue from Roche consisted of $9.6 million in milestone payments related to Roche completing regulatory filings and approvals for Tamiflu in the U.S. and Japan. As of December 31, 2002, Gilead is entitled to additional milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon Roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones. 45 In April 2002, Gilead and GSK entered into a licensing agreement providing GSK the rights to commercialize Hepsera, Gileads antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in Asia, Latin America and certain other territories. Under the agreement, Gilead retained rights to Hepsera in the U.S., Canada, Eastern and Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. GSK received exclusive rights to develop Hepsera solely for the treatment of hepatitis B in all of its territories, the most significant of which include China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. In addition, GSK paid Gilead an up front licensing fee of $10.0 million as the first payment against these additional obligations and, may pay up to $30.0 million upon achievement by GSK of certain regulatory, development and commercial milestones. Of this $30.0 million, $2.0 million was received for the U.S. approval of Hepsera in September 2002. GSK also will pay Gilead a royalty on net sales, if any, of Hepsera in the GSK territories. GSK will have full responsibility for development and commercialization of Hepsera in GSKs territories. The $10.0 million up front fee and the $2.0 million U.S. approval fee have been recorded as deferred revenue in 2002 with a total of $0.5 million being recognized as contract revenue in 2002. The balance of deferred revenue at December 31, 2002 will be amortized into contract revenue over the period of Gileads remaining obligations under the agreement, approximately 14 years. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. To date, we have received $130.0 million in cash and $38.8 million in OSI stock. Under this agreement, we are entitled to additional payments from OSI of up to $30.0 million in either cash or a combination of cash and OSI stock if and when OSI reaches certain development milestones for NX 211, the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to OSI. Under a related manufacturing agreement, we will produce NX 211 and GS 7904L, the two liposomal products included in the sale at our manufacturing facility in San Dimas, California. In 2002, we recognized $3.3 million of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement with Archemix Corporation relating to our SELEX technology. Under this agreement, we gave Archemix the exclusive rights to the SELEX process, including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre existing agreements. Archemix paid to us $8.5 million in 2002 and $9.0 million in 2001. As required by our license agreement with ULEHI, we paid 5% of the $8.5 million and $9.0 million payments to ULEHI. We also received a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of Archemix common stock, the value of which is not material. As required by our license agreement with ULEHI, we transferred 5% of this warrant to ULEHI. In March 2000, we entered into an agreement with EyeTech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. relating to Gileads proprietary aptamer EYE001, currently known as Macugen. Currently in early clinical trials, Macugen is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, EyeTech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of Macugen, and, if the product is successfully commercialized, EyeTech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product. EyeTech also will be responsible for all research and development costs. We provided clinical supplies of the product to EyeTech through March 2001. We received a $7.0 million up front licensing fee from EyeTech in April 2000, which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period. Accordingly, $5.2 million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in 2000, and $1.8 million was recognized as revenue in 2001. We are also entitled to additional cash payments from EyeTech of up to $25.0 million if and when EyeTech reaches certain Macugen development milestones. Additionally, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of EyeTech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share, the price at which the stock was issued to other investors. 46 Gross Margins Product gross margins were 83.6% in 2002, compared with 77.1% in 2001 and 77.6% in 2000. The improvement from 2001 to 2002 is primarily driven by product mix as Viread, a higher margin product, contributed significantly to net product sales in 2002, whereas only modest sales of Viread were recorded in 2001. Foreign exchange also impacts gross margins as we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in U.S. Dollars. For example, an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into U.S. Dollars, will increase. In 2002, gross margins were positively impacted by the weakening U.S. dollar while in 2001 and 2000, gross margins were negatively impacted by these factors, as discussed in the product sales section under the caption "Revenues" above. Except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar and the mix of product sales between Viread, Hepsera and AmBisome, we expect gross margins in 2003 to remain relatively stable compared to 2002. Operating Expenses In 2002, R&D expenses were 35% of total costs and expenses. In total, R&D expenses were $134.8 million in 2002, compared with $185.6 million in 2001 and $132.3 million in 2000. The major components of R&D expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase 1,2, and 3 clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. The following table breaks down these major components of research and development spending (in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 Research $ 27,856 $ 30,535 $ 24,925 Clinical development 82,261 107,229 72,881 Pharmaceutical development 24,641 25,392 24,431 Oncology (divested) 22,397 10,102 Total $ 134,758 $ 185,553 $ 132,339 The $50.8 million decrease in R&D spending in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the reduction in expenses associated with the clinical program for Viread, which was approved in October 2001, and the elimination of expenses associated with our oncology program as a result of the sale of our oncology program to OSI in December 2001. Additionally, in 2001 we recognized as expense $10.6 million of a $13.0 million up front license fee paid to Cubist Pharmaceuticals related to the European licensing agreement for daptomycin, also known as Cidecin, signed in January 2001. Upon termination of this agreement in September 2002, $2.0 million was recorded to R&D, which represented the remaining unamortized asset related to the preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin. Excluding the impact of the Triangle acquisition, we expect R&D expenses in 2003 to be approximately $160 million to $180 million, or approximately 20% to 35% higher than 2002 expenses. The $53.3 million increase in R&D spending in 2001 versus 2000 was attributable in part to the recognition of $10.6 million of the $13.0 million up front payment and $5.5 million of clinical milestone 47 payments to Cubist under the European licensing agreement for Cidecin. In addition, our expenses associated with the clinical programs for Viread and Hepsera increased by approximately $18.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively, during the year. Recent industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes 10 to 15 years (an average of 12 years) to research, develop and bring to market as a new prescription medicine in the U.S. These averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally, although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis. Drug development in the U.S. is a process that includes several steps defined by the FDA. The process begins with the filing of an IND, which, if successful, allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase 1, 2, and 3, and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drugs total development time. The most significant costs associated with clinical development are the Phase 3 trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We currently have products in development that are in Phase 3 studies. The successful development of our products is highly uncertain. An estimation of completion dates and R&D expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict. Even after successful development and FDA approval of a product, we undertake additional studies to try and expand the products label and market potential. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products, see the "Risk Factors That Affect Gilead" section of Item I above. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $181.3 million in 2002, compared with $125.1 million in 2001 and $82.0 million in 2000. The increase in expenses in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts, including the expansion of Gileads U.S. and European sales forces to support the commercial launches of Viread and Hepsera. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2001 versus 2000 was primarily due to Gileads increased global marketing efforts and the expansion of our sales force to support the commercial launch of Viread. In 2003, we expect SG&A expenses, excluding the impact of the Triangle acquisition, to be approximately $250 million to $270 million, or 40% to 50% higher than 2002 levels, primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the continued promotion of Viread, Hepsera and AmBisome. Gain on Sale of Oncology Assets In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets, pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property, as well as our Boulder, Colorado operations, including clinical research and drug development personnel, infrastructure and facilities, to OSI. The pipeline of clinical candidates includes NX 211 (liposomal lurtotecan), GS 7836 (a nucleoside analogue) and GS 7904L (a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor). On the closing date, we received $130.0 million in cash and OSI common stock valued at approximately $38.8 million. We recorded a non operating gain of $157.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of this transaction. In addition, we recorded income taxes of $3.3 million in connection with this transaction. Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities In July 2002, the Company sold all of its remaining shares of OSI common stock for approximately $22.0 million. These shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in December 2001, at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately $38.0 million. In connection with the sale of these remaining shares, we recognized a non operating loss of approximately $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. 48 Gain on Sale of Unconsolidated Affiliate In August 2001, we also sold our 49 percent interest in Proligo L.L.C. (Proligo) to Degussa Corporation for $14.3 million in cash. Proligo was a joint venture between Gilead and SKW Americas, Inc. focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides. SKW Americas, a subsidiary of Degussa Corporation, held the remaining 51 percent of Proligo. The proceeds, net of Gileads investment in Proligo, are reflected as an $8.8 million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate in 2001. Interest Income and Interest Expense We recorded interest income of $22.3 million in 2002, compared with $25.6 million in 2001 and $17.6 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates, partially offset by a higher average cash balance due to positive cash flow from operations and to the proceeds from the sale of the oncology assets to OSI. The increase in 2001 over 2000 was due to higher average balances of invested funds. Interest income in 2003 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates, over which we have no control and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. We incurred interest expense of $13.9 million in 2002, compared with $14.0 million in 2001 and $4.4 million in 2000. The significant increase in 2001 over 2000 is due to the full year of interest on our $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes. Interest expense for 2000 consisted primarily of interest on the $79.5 million 6.25% convertible notes, which were converted to common stock in August 2000. We expect interest expense in 2003 to increase as compared with 2002 expense levels primarily due to the issuance of the $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes in December 2002. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $1.3 million, $4.1 million and $1.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This income tax expense was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we have significant net operating losses which reduce our U.S. tax liability. The significant increase in income tax expense in 2001 resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to OSI, for which we recorded approximately $3.3 million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes. The provision for 2002 was reduced by a change in U.S. income tax law. This law allows net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset 100% of alternative minimum taxable income, resulting in a reduction of U.S. income tax recorded in the previous years of $1.3 million. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If it were determined that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made. Likewise, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made. We evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliate In 2001, we recorded $2.1 million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate, Proligo, prior to the date of the sale of our 49 percent interest. In 2000, we recorded $2.9 million as our equity in the loss of Proligo. This represented our 49 percent share of Proligos loss for the thirteen month period ended December 31, 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Proligo changed its fiscal year end to December 31 from November 30. 49  Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In the year ended December 31, 2001, Gilead adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $1.1 million. In the year ended December 31, 2000, Gilead adopted the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of ($13.7) million. See Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the fourth quarter of 2002, a misclassification was discovered in the December 31, 2001 balance sheet and cash flow statement for the year then ended. At December 31, 2001, $38.8 million of OSI stock received in consideration for the divestiture of our oncology assets was misclassified on the balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents instead of as marketable securities. The misclassification had no impact on our statement of operations for any period, including revenues and net income. The December 31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet and 2001 consolidated statement of cash flows in this report have been changed to reflect the correct classification. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $942.4 million at December 31, 2002, up from $582.9 million at December 31, 2001. The increase of $359.5 million was primarily due to the $336.6 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible senior notes in December 2002. Other major sources and uses of cash included net cash provided by operations of $74.4 million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of $51.4 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $17.6 million and a $50.0 million convertible note received from Triangle. The $50.0 million loan to Triangle was returned to us in connection with the now completed acquisition. In January 2003, approximately $463.1 million has been paid to complete the acquisition of Triangle. Working capital at December 31, 2002 was $1,078.9 million compared to $627.6 million at December 31, 2001. Significant changes in working capital during 2002 included a $43.9 million increase in accounts receivable and a $12.3 million increase in inventory. The accounts receivable increase was primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the U.S. and Europe. The $12.3 million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the production of Viread inventory to meet increasing sales demand. Significant changes in current liabilities during 2002 included an $11.5 million increase in accrued liabilities, an $8.9 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses, a $6.8 million increase in accrued compensation, a $5.2 million increase in accounts payable and a $13.1 million increase in deferred revenue. The $11.5 million increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to Medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of Viread. The $8.9 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses is primarily due to decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for Viread and Hepsera. The $6.8 million increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to increased bonus accruals and the expansion of our sales force. The $5.2 million increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread sales growth. The $13.1 million increase in deferred revenue primarily relates to the $12.0 million received under the collaboration with GSK that we entered into in April 2002. The $13.4 million effect of exchange rate changes on cash is primarily due to the weakening U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and the translation of our foreign subsidiaries accounts receivable balances, which are primarily denominated in the Euro currency. We made capital expenditures of $17.6 million in 2002, $26.3 million in 2001 and $15.6 million in 2000. These expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth, as well as for laboratory and manufacturing equipment. Capital expenditures related to research and development were between 20% to 25% of the $17.6 million spent in 2002 and 50% to 60% of the 50 $26.3 million spent in 2001. We expect our capital spending for 2003 to be significantly higher than 2002 levels due to increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending. In December 2002, we issued $345.0 million of 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes are currently convertible into a total of up to 7,340,425 shares of Gilead common stock at $47.00 per share. The $47.00 conversion price was higher than Gileads common stock price at the notes issuance date. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on or after June 19, 2004, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs of $8.4 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets, and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes. In December 2000, we issued $250.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes are currently convertible into a total of up to 10,178,116 shares of Gilead common stock at $24.5625 per share. The $24.5625 conversion price was higher than Gileads common stock price at the notes issuance date. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on or after December 20, 2003, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs of $8.2 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets, and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes. In August 2000, we redeemed our 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures at a cash price of $1,030 per $1,000 principal amount of debentures outstanding, plus accrued interest, which was the redemption price provided for in the original debenture indenture. Upon redemption, the entire $79.5 million in principal amount of the debentures outstanding at that time was converted into 7,135,156 newly issued shares of Gilead common stock by August 15, 2000. Deferred debt issuance costs of $1.6 million related to the debentures were charged to additional paid in capital in connection with the conversion of the debentures into common stock. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the commercial performance of Viread, Hepsera and AmBisome, the commercial performance of any of our other products in development that receive marketing approval, including emtricitabine from our acquisition of Triangle completed in January 2003, the success of our partners research, development and commercialization efforts for the products they have partnered with us, the progress of our research and development efforts, the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, the rate of technological advances, determinations as to the commercial potential of our products under development, administrative expenses, the status of competitive products, the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements, the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities, 51 our possible geographic expansion, and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners. If such funding is required, we cannot assure you that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Subsidiaries and Other We have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations. All of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements. We do not have any "special purpose" entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements, including those defined as "variable interest entities" by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. We are also not involved in any non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value. We have no commercial commitments with related parties, except for employee loans. We have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases, notes payable and clinical research organization contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In November 2002, The EITF reached a consensus on Issue 00 21, addressing how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and or rights to use assets. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria: (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis; (2) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and (3) delivery of any undelivered item is probable. Arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. The final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003 with early adoption permitted. We are reviewing the provisions of this consensus to determine the effect, if any, it may have on the Companys financial position and results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (or FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. Our adoption of the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 is an amendment to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based 52 Compensation issued in October 1995. SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The additional disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (or APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for employee stock options.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the U.S. as well as sales activities in Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. To mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable. A significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. Effective January 2002, we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2002. The contracts have maturities of one year or less with one exception. One hedge contract intended to hedge raw materials purchases in the first quarter of 2004, with a notional amount of $4.3 million and an insignificant fair value at December 31, 2002 has a maturity of 13 months. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per U.S. dollar. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2002 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Currency Notional Amount Average Rate Fair Value December 31, 2002 British Pound 6,920 0.6496 69 Euro 46,567 0.9743 (1,131 ) The total notional amount of $53.5 million and fair value of ($1.1) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2002 compares with a total notional amount of 53 $72.3 million and fair value of ($0.9) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2001. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to the investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and Competitive after tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest bearing assets and fixed rate liabilities at December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands). Years ending December 31, Fair Value December 31, 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Assets Available for sale securities $ 674,770 $ 186,392 $ 24,035 $ 885,197 $ 885,197 Average interest rate 1.72 % 2.74 % 2.70 % Liabilities Long term obligations, including current portion(1) $ 14,159 $ 9,499 $ 9,140 $ 5,693 $ 4,073 $ 1,418 $ 43,982 $ 43,982 Average interest rate 13.81 % 16.44 % 16.40 % 20.75 % 20.75 % Convertible senior debentures $ 345,000 $ 345,000 $ 357,410 Interest rate 2.00 % Convertible subordinated debentures $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ 381,877 Interest rate 5.00 % (1)Long term obligations consist of capital leases, operating leases (net of noncancelable subleases) and debt secured by property, plant and equipment. The interest portion of payments due is included. International Credit Risk Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2002 was $125.0 million compared to $74.2 million at December 31, 2001. The growth was primarily due to higher product sales for Viread in the U.S. and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, 54 the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2002, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled approximately $49.7 million, of which approximately $26.6 million was more than 120 days past due. At December 31, 2001, past due receivables for these countries were $28.7 million, of which approximately $9.9 million was more than 120 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that all accounts receivable balances as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, including those due from customers in these four countries, are collectible. We continually seek to improve our collection processes to ensure that we fully collect amounts due to us based on our product sales and that collections are timely.
