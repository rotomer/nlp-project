ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases. We are a multinational company, with revenues from six approved products and marketing operations in ten countries. We focus our research and clinical programs on anti infectives. Currently, we market Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV infection; Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection; AmBisome (amphotericin B liposome for injection), an antifungal agent; and Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of CMV retinitis. Roche markets Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment of influenza, under a royalty paying collaborative agreement with us. In December 2003, we made the decision to discontinue selling DaunoXome (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection), a drug approved for the treatment of Kaposis Sarcoma. We are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through an 35 active product acquisition and in licensing strategy, such as our acquisition of the assets of Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed in January 2003. Our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets, target screening and medicinal chemistry. In addition, we are currently developing clinical stage products to treat HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B. Our operating results for 2003 in comparison to 2002 were characterized by solid growth in our key HIV drug, Viread and represent our second consecutive year of significant increases in total product revenues. Based on independent third party data, Viread has become one of the most widely prescribed antiretrovirals in its class of drugs, achieving more new and total prescriptions than competing drugs in the nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) market. As a result of the growth of Viread sales, higher than expected AmBisome sales and controlled spending, we have generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last two years, with an increase to $234.6 million in 2003 from $74.4 million in 2002, or 215% year over year growth. We expect our HIV drug sales to grow in the near term, although we expect it to be at a slower rate than we have experienced in the past two years. Enabling this growth is the increasing importance of once daily regimens in prescribing HIV medications. The availability of both Viread and Emtriva (acquired from Triangle) now provide physicians the ability to construct once daily regimens. Operating results for 2003 were impacted by the acquisition of all of the assets of Triangle in January 2003. We completed this acquisition to expand our antiviral pipeline. Triangle was a development stage company with a particular focus on potential therapies for HIV, including AIDS, and the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The aggregate purchase price was $525.2 million, including cash paid of $463.1 million for the outstanding stock, the fair value of stock options assumed of $41.3 million, estimated direct transaction costs of $14.2 million and employee related costs of $6.6 million. Approximately $488.6 million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and represented the fair value of Triangles incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. As a result of this transaction and the related in process research and development charge, our operating loss for 2003 was $158.7 million versus operating income of $81.0 million in 2002. This acquisition was important to us not only for the compounds we acquired, but also for the opportunity it provided us to create a co formulation of Viread and Emtriva into a single pill that can be dosed once a day. If successful, we expect this co formulated product to further grow our HIV franchise. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Triangle acquisition. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a transaction valued at up to $200.0 million in cash and OSI stock. This transaction has allowed us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors The following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please read Risk Factors that Affect Gilead in Part I for factors that could cause or contribute to material differences between these forward looking statements and actual results. The Risk Factors discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. 36 Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, accrued clinical and preclinical expenses, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: We record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products, government rebate programs, such as Medicaid reimbursements, and customer incentives, such as cash discounts for prompt payment. Estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for product returns, including new products, are based on an on going analysis of industry and historical return patterns. This includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction, the purchase of third party data to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels and subsequent prescriptions as well as, for new products, a review of our other long shelf life products we have sold through the same or similar channels. Further, we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary. Expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from 24 months for Viread up to 36 months for AmBisome in the U.S. If conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change, we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives. This would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered. For example, between 2002 and 2003, we increased our reserve for government discounts on Viread sales by more than 3% as a result of our review of historical utilization rates and the impact of a 2003 mid year price increase for Viread. We could see similar increases in the future based on our continued reviews of utilization rates and any potential U.S. price increases for Viread. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on the government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market, could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. 37 We write down our inventory based on historical review of the quantity of raw material bad batches experienced in a given year and expectations of production and inventory levels. We also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches. We generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long. However, if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels, demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required which could negatively impact our product gross margins. We record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs. Most of our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, we incurred $15.0 million, $23.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively, of CRO costs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs on a straight line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on going review of the level of effort actually incurred by the CRO. Initially we estimate that the work performed under the contracts occurs ratably over the periods to the expected milestone, event or total contract completion date. The expected completion dates are estimated based upon the terms of the contracts and past experience with similar contracts. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and other measures of activities specified in the contract. As a result, we validate our accruals quarterly through written vendor confirmations and detailed reviews of the activities performed under each contract. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary so that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. Gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start up activities in house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre study visits, training, and program management. On a budgeted basis, these costs are typically 25% to 30% of the total contract value. On an actual basis, this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or contracted in scope compared to the original budget while the start up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly. Start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been established and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed price and can vary in length between six months for a single dose Phase 1 study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 study. The average length of contract for 2002 and 2003 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva. Through December 31, 2003, we have not understated or overstated activity levels for any particular study such that a material adjustment was required. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and Gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO at any point in time during the contract, regardless of payment status. Amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we would have to record additional and potentially significant research and development expenses in future periods. We develop our income tax provision including deferred tax assets and liabilities based on significant management judgment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax 38 assets to the amount that is likely to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If it were determined that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets related to the valuation allowance, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made. Such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of 2003 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $111.6 milion. Likewise, if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made. We evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws or rates, changes in interpretation to these laws and overall changes in future levels of earnings and research and development and capital spending. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of Gileads Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them. Results of Operations Total revenues We had total revenue of $867.9 million in 2003, $466.8 million in 2002 and $233.8 million in 2001. Included in total revenue are net product sales, royalty revenue and contract revenue, including revenue from research & development (R&D) and manufacturing collaborations. Product sales consisted of the following (in thousands): Product sales 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Viread $ 566,478 151 % $ 225,815 1349 % $ 15,586 AmBisome 198,350 7 % 185,669 13 % 164,533 Other 71,513 477 % 12,395 14 % 10,851 Total product sales $ 836,341 97 % $ 423,879 122 % $ 190,970 Product sales increased 97% in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to significant increases in sales of Viread for HIV, which was approved for sale in the U.S. in October 2001 and the European Union in February 2002 and has since become an antiretroviral therapy widely prescribed by physicians. A significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. In January 2002, we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. This reduces, but does not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Losses on these revenue hedges reduced product revenues by $2.8 million in 2003 and $1.0 million in 2002. Sales of Viread were 68% of total product sales in 2003, compared to 53% of total product sales in 2002 and 8% of total product sales in 2001. Of the Viread sales in 2003, $355.9 million were U.S. sales, an increase of 113% versus 2002, and $210.6 million were international sales, an increase of 258% versus 2002. With the continued market expansion of Viread, we expect Viread sales in 2004 to grow approximately 25% to 30% and be in the range of $700 million to $750 million. 39 During 2003, we experienced significant fluctuations in U.S. distribution channel inventory levels due to speculative purchasing by the major wholesalers. As a result, we experienced increased quarter to quarter sales volatility from these purchasing patterns. While we have enacted certain policies to reduce this type of purchasing and are in discussions with our key wholesalers, we expect to continue to experience sales volatility for the foreseeable future. Prior to 2002, our revenues were primarily derived from sales of AmBisome, which represented 44% of total product sales in 2002 and 86% of total product sales in 2001. AmBisome sales in 2003 were $21.7 million higher due to the favorable currency environment compared to 2002. On a volume basis, AmBisome sales in Europe decreased by 5% compared to 2002 due to increasing competition. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, AmBisome sales grew 9% for 2002 over 2001. The increase in sales in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to volume sales increases in Europe, which offset declining sales in the U.S. With the expected increase in competition, we expect AmBisome sales for 2004 to be lower than 2003 and in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Royalty Revenue We recorded royalty revenue of $25.2 million in 2003, compared with $20.4 million in 2002 and $23.0 million in 2001. During this three year period, the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of AmBisome in the U.S. by Fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with us. Royalty revenue from Fujisawa was $12.5 million in 2003, compared with $15.7 million in 2002 and $17.1 million in 2001. We also recorded royalty revenue of $12.0 million in 2003, $3.4 million in 2002 and $4.5 million in 2001 related to sales of Tamiflu. We began recognizing royalties from Tamiflu in the first quarter of 2000. In June 2002, Roche received European regulatory approval of Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults. As it is difficult to estimate third party product sales, we record royalty revenue one quarter in arrears. Due to this lag in reporting, the royalties related to the severe flu epidemic in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2003 will be recorded in the first quarter of 2004. Contract Revenue Total contract revenue was $6.3 million in 2003, compared with $22.5 million in 2002 and $19.8 million in 2001. In 2002 and 2001 a primary source of contract revenue was our licensing of the SELEX process patent estate to Archemix, which, due to collectibility concerns, we recognized as the cash was received. This provided contract revenue of $8.1 million in 2002 and $8.6 million in 2001. In 2002, Roche made milestone payments of $8.0 million for the European prophylaxis and treatment approvals of Tamiflu, and in 2001 made a $2.0 million milestone payment relating to the development of Tamiflu under an R&D collaboration agreement. As of December 31, 2003, we are entitled to additional milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon Roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones. In April 2002, Gilead and GSK entered into a licensing agreement providing GSK the rights to commercialize Hepsera, our antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in Asia, Latin America and certain other territories. Under the agreement, Gilead retained rights to Hepsera in the U.S., Canada, Eastern and Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. GSK received exclusive rights to develop Hepsera solely for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in all of its territories, the most significant of which include China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. GSK paid us an up front licensing fee of $10.0 million and, may pay up to an additional $30.0 million upon achievement by GSK of certain regulatory, development and commercial milestones. Of this $30.0 million, $2.0 million was received for the U.S. approval of Hepsera in September 2002 and $2.0 million was received for the Canadian approval of Hepsera in August 2003. GSK also will pay us a royalty on net sales, if any, of Hepsera in the GSK territories. GSK will have full 40 responsibility for development and commercialization of Hepsera in GSKs territories. The $10.0 million up front fee and $4.0 million of approval milestone fees have been recorded as deferred revenue with a total of $0.9 million and $0.5 million being recognized as contract revenue in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $12.6 million balance of deferred revenue at December 31, 2003 will be amortized into contract revenue over the period of our remaining obligations under the agreement, approximately 12 years. In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets to OSI. To date, we have received $130.0 million in cash and $38.8 million in OSI stock from this sale. Under this agreement, we are entitled to additional payments from OSI of up to $30.0 million in either cash or a combination of cash and OSI stock if and when OSI reaches certain development milestones for NX 211, the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to OSI. Under a related manufacturing agreement, we will produce NX 211 and GS 7904L, the two liposomal products included in the sale at our manufacturing facility in San Dimas, California. In 2003 and 2002, we recognized $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement with Archemix Corporation relating to our SELEX technology. Under this agreement, we gave Archemix exclusive rights to the SELEX process, including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre existing agreements. Archemix paid to us $8.5 million in 2002 and $9.0 million in 2001 and recorded the net amounts of $8.1 million and $8.6 million as contract revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. As required by our license agreement with ULEHI, we paid 5% of the $8.5 million and $9.0 million payments to ULEHI. We also received a warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of Archemix common stock, the value of which is not material. As required by our license agreement with ULEHI, we transferred 5% of this warrant to ULEHI at that time. We have since transferred the remainder of the warrant to ULEHI. In March 2000, we entered into an agreement with EyeTech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. relating to our proprietary aptamer EYE001, currently known as Macugen. Currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, Macugen is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, EyeTech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of Macugen, and, if the product is successfully commercialized, EyeTech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product. EyeTech also will be responsible for all research and development costs. We provided clinical supplies of the product to EyeTech through March 2001. We received a $7.0 million up front licensing fee from EyeTech in April 2000, which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period. Accordingly, $5.2 million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in 2000, and $1.8 million was recognized as revenue in 2001. We are also entitled to additional cash payments from EyeTech of up to $25.0 million if and when EyeTech reaches certain Macugen development milestones. Additionally, we received a warrant to purchase 791,667 shares of EyeTech series B convertible preferred stock, exercisable at a price of $6.00 per share, the price at which the stock was issued to other investors. In January 2004, EyeTech completed its initial public offering. We intend to exercise our warrant for shares of common stock and sell the shares subject to a 180 day lock up period. The fair value of the warrant has been adjusted in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the EyeTech public offering. Cost of Goods Sold The following table indicates cost of goods sold (in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Cost of goods sold $ 112,691 62 % $ 69,724 59 % $ 43,764 Substantially all of the increase from each year to year period can be attributed to increases in the volume of Viread sold, as this product was launched in the U.S. late in the third quarter of 2001. 41 Gross Margins Product gross margins were 86.5% in 2003, compared with 83.6% in 2002 and 77.1% in 2001. The improvement from 2002 to 2003 and 2001 to 2002 is primarily driven by product mix as Viread, a higher margin product, contributed more significantly to net product sales in each succeeding year. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates also impact gross margins as we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in U.S. Dollars. For example, an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into U.S. Dollars, will increase. In 2003 and 2002, gross margins were positively impacted by the weakening U.S. dollar while in 2001, gross margins were negatively impacted by these factors. Since 2002, forward contracts have been used to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, which can reduce the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on our gross margins. Except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar and the mix of product sales between Viread, Hepsera and AmBisome, we expect gross margins in 2004 to remain relatively stable compared to 2003. Research and Development Expenses In 2003, R&D expenses were 31% of total costs and expenses, excluding purchased in process research and development expense. In total, R&D expenses were $164.9 million in 2003, compared with $134.8 million in 2002 and $185.6 million in 2001. The major components of R&D expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work. Clinical development costs include Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials as well as expanded access programs. Pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis. The following table breaks down research and development expenses into these major components (in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Research $ 37,497 35 % $ 27,856 (9 )% $ 30,535 Clinical development 90,547 10 % 82,261 (23 )% 107,229 Pharmaceutical development 36,829 49 % 24,641 (3 )% 25,392 Oncology (divested) 22,397 Total $ 164,873 22 % $ 134,758 (27 )% $ 185,553 The $30.1 million increase in R&D spending in 2003 versus 2002 was attributable to increased headcount and the clinical trials associated with the development of Emtriva and the co formulation of Viread and Emtriva. In addition, during 2003, we settled a contractual dispute with a vendor that resulted in reimbursement to us of $13.2 million that was recorded to research and development expense. We expect R&D expenses in 2004 to be approximately $200 million to $220 million, or approximately 20% to 30% higher than 2003 expenses, due primarily to costs associated with the development of the fixed dose combination of Viread and Emtriva. The $50.8 million decrease in R&D spending in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the reduction in expenses associated with the clinical program for Viread, which was approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S. in October 2001, and the elimination of expenses associated with our oncology program as 42 a result of the sale of that program to OSI in December 2001. Additionally, in 2001 we recognized as expense $10.6 million of a $13.0 million up front license fee paid to Cubist Pharmaceuticals related to the European licensing agreement for daptomycin, also known as Cidecin, signed in January 2001. Upon termination of this agreement in September 2002, we recorded $2.0 million of R&D expense, which represented the remaining unamortized asset related to the preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin. Industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes 10 to 15 years (an average of 12 years) to research, develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the U.S. These averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally, although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis. Drug development in the U.S. is a process that includes several steps defined by the FDA. The process begins with the filing of an IND, which, if successful, allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Clinical development typically involves three phases of study: Phase 1, 2, and 3, and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drugs total development time. The most significant costs associated with clinical development are the Phase 3 trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We currently have products in development that are in Phase 3 studies. The successful development of our products is highly uncertain. Completion dates and R&D expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict. Even after successful development and FDA approval of a product, we undertake additional studies to try and expand the products label and market potential. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products, see the Risk Factors That Affect Gilead section of Item I above. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table highlights selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands): 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Selling, general and administrative $ 250,157 38 % $ 181,301 45 % $ 125,141 The increase in expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts, including the expansion of our U.S. and European sales forces and increased infrastructure investments required to support the growth of our business. The increase in expenses in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts, including the expansion of our U.S. and European sales forces to support the commercial launches of Viread and Hepsera. In 2004, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $310 million to $330 million, or 25% to 30% higher than 2003 levels, primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the continued promotion of Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and AmBisome. In process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle completed in January 2003, we recorded in process research and development expenses of $488.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The charge was due to Triangles incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The remaining efforts for completion of Triangles research and development projects primarily consist of clinical trials, the cost, length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict. Numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development, including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. Feedback from regulatory authorities or results from 43 clinical trials might require modifications or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed. We cannot be certain that emtricitabine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, purchased from Triangle, will be approved in the U.S. or the European Union or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use. We have terminated our rights with respect to the other potential products that we acquired with the acquisition of Triangle. We also do not yet have approval of the fixed dose combination product containing tenofovir DF and emtricitabine. Future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review, which may differ materially from current projections. The acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized. Emtriva, for example, is a product with many similarities to other existing products. As a result, it may be difficult to successfully penetrate the market and to achieve significant revenues. In addition, emtricitabine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B faces significant uncertainties associated with pricing, efficacy, and the cost to produce that may not be successfully resolved. As a result, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of this product, as we did with clevudine and amdoxovir, if we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. The value of the acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between 2003 and 2020 using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 15.75%. This discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired. The projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired, the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product, the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Asset Impairment During 2003, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $10.2 million on certain of our long lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, manufacturing and laboratory equipment. This non cash charge was driven by the decision in December 2003 to terminate our liposomal research and development activities in San Dimas and discontinue the DaunoXome product line. The impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value. As the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows, we wrote the carrying value of the long lived assets down to their estimated fair value. Gain on Sale of Oncology Assets In December 2001, we completed the sale of our oncology assets, pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property, as well as our Boulder, Colorado operations, including clinical research and drug development personnel, infrastructure and facilities, to OSI. The pipeline of clinical candidates includes NX 211 (liposomal lurtotecan), GS 7836 (a nucleoside analogue) and GS 7904L (a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor). On the closing date, we received $130.0 million in cash and OSI common stock valued at approximately $38.8 million. We recorded a non operating gain of $157.8 million and income taxes of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of this transaction. Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities In July 2002, we sold all of our remaining shares of OSI common stock for approximately $22.0 million. These shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to OSI in 44 December 2001, at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately $38.0 million. In connection with the sale of these remaining shares, we recognized a non operating loss of approximately $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. Gain on Sale of Unconsolidated Affiliate In August 2001, we sold our 49 percent interest in Proligo L.L.C. (Proligo) to Degussa Corporation for $14.3 million in cash. Proligo was a joint venture between us and SKW Americas, Inc. focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides. SKW Americas, a subsidiary of Degussa Corporation, held the remaining 51 percent of Proligo. The proceeds, net of our investment in Proligo, are reflected as an $8.8 million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate in 2001. Interest and Other Income, net We recorded interest and other income of $13.0 million in 2003, compared with $22.3 million in 2002 and $25.6 million in 2001. The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance due to the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle and the purchase of our Foster City campus, partially offset by positive cash flow from operations. The decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates, partially offset by a higher average cash balance due to positive cash flow from operations and to the proceeds from the sale of the oncology assets to OSI. Interest income in 2004 will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates, over which we have no control and the level of our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest Expense We incurred interest expense of $21.9 million in 2003, compared with $13.9 million in 2002 and $14.0 million in 2001. The significant increase in 2003 over 2002 is due to the full year of interest on our $345.0 million 2% convertible senior notes, issued in December 2002. Interest expense for 2002 and 2001 consisted primarily of interest on the $250.0 million 5.0% convertible subordinated notes, which were converted to common stock in December 2003. We expect interest expense in 2004 to decrease as compared with 2003 primarily due to the redemption of the $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes in December 2003. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was ($95.5) million, $1.3 million and $4.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The benefit in 2003 includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets. In December of 2003, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of $111.6 million. The recognition of these deferred tax assets has no impact on our current period cash flows. The recognition of these deferred tax assets increased reported earnings per share due to the resulting benefit recorded in the statement of operations from the reduction in our valuation allowance. Partially offsetting the tax benefit recorded is income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, foreign losses at lower rates and the non tax deductibility of the purchased in process research and development charge. We had significant net operating losses reducing our U.S. liability. Excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance, and the write off of purchased in process research and development, our effective tax rate for 2003 was 5%. For 2004, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 32% to 35% range for the full year, reflecting a more normalized tax rate going forward. 45 The income tax expense in 2002 and 2001 was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we had significant net operating losses, which reduced our U.S. tax liability. The significant increases in income tax expense in 2001 resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to OSI, for which we recorded approximately $3.3 million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes. The provision for 2002 was reduced by a change in the U.S. income tax law. This law allowed net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset 100% of alternative minimum taxable income, resulting in a reduction of U.S. income tax recorded in the previous years of $1.3 million. Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliate In 2001, we recorded $2.1 million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate, Proligo. We sold our 49 percent interest in August 2001. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In 2001, we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $1.1 million. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $707.0 million at December 31, 2003, down from $942.4 million at December 31, 2002. The decrease of $235.4 million was primarily due to the acquisition of Triangle, for which the net cash impact was $375.5 million, and the purchase of our Foster City campus for $123.0 million. Other major sources and uses of cash included net cash provided by operations of $234.6 million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of $83.8 million, partially offset by additional capital expenditures of $38.6 million. Working capital at December 31, 2003 was $1,080.0 million compared to $1,078.9 million at December 31, 2002. Significant changes in working capital during 2003 included a $97.1 million increase in accounts receivable, a $46.5 million increase in inventory and a $197.6 million increase in current deferred tax assets. The accounts receivable increase was primarily due to increased sales of Viread in the U.S. and Europe. The $46.5 million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of Viread inventory to meet increasing sales demand. The $197.6 million increase in current deferred tax assets was due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. The $6.1 million increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of Viread sales growth. Significant changes in current liabilities during 2003 included a $44.5 million increase in accrued liabilities. The significant components of the $44.5 million increase in accrued liabilities, exclusive of the assumed liabilities associated with the acquisition of the net assets of Triangle, consist of a $44.2 million increase in other accrued liabilities and a $6.2 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses. The $44.2 million increase in other accrued liabilities is primarily due to Medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of Viread, an increase in our income taxes payable and an increase in the recorded liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts. The $6.2 million increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to increased bonus accruals and the expansion of our sales force. The $5.9 million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses is primarily due to decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for Viread and Hepsera. In addition to the purchase of our Foster City campus, we made capital expenditures of $38.6 million in 2003, compared to $17.6 million in 2002 and $26.3 million in 2001. These expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth, as well as for laboratory and manufacturing 46 equipment. Capital expenditures related to research and development were between 50% and 60% of the $38.6 million spent in 2003, 20% to 25% of the $17.6 million spent in 2002 and 50% to 60% of the $26.3 million spent in 2001. We expect our capital spending for 2004 to be $55.0 million to $65.0 million due to increased infrastructure needs and higher R&D spending associated with the pilot plant we are constructing at our Foster City facilities. In December 2002, we issued $345.0 million of 2% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes are currently convertible into a total of up to 7,340,425 shares of Gilead common stock at $47.00 per share. The $47.00 conversion price was higher than Gileads common stock price at the notes issuance date. The notes are redeemable in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on or after June 19, 2004, at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs of $8.4 million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets, and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes. In December 2000, we issued $250.0 million of 5% convertible subordinated notes due December 15, 2007 in a private offering. The notes were convertible into a total of up to 10,178,116 shares of Gilead common stock at $24.5625 per share. The $24.5625 conversion price was higher than Gileads common stock price at the notes issuance date. Gilead called the $250.0 million 5% convertible subordinated notes for redemption in November 2003 and converted them to Gilead common stock in December 2003. Upon the conversion, the $4.6 million remaining balance of the related debt issuance costs was reclassified to additional paid in capital. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the commercial performance of our current and future products, the progress and scope of our research and development efforts, including preclinical studies, and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities, administrative expenses, the costs associated with our no profit Global Access program for least developed nations, the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or office facilities, the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products, and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings, such as from our universal shelf registration filing in December 2003 for the potential issuance of up to $500.0 million of our securities, or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Subsidiaries and Other We have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations. All of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements. We do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements. We are also 47 not involved in any non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value. We have no commercial commitments with related parties, except for employee loans. Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases, notes payable, raw material supply arrangements and clinical research organization contracts. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt obligations $ 345,000 $ $ $ 345,000 $ Capital lease obligations 563 196 367 Operating lease obligations 55,238 7,036 25,169 12,838 10,195 Capital commitments(1) 15,700 15,700 Inventory purchase obligations(2) 70,536 36,637 33,899 Clinical trials(3) 53,638 41,631 8,631 3,376 Total $ 540,675 $ 101,200 $ 68,066 $ 361,214 $ 10,195 (1) At December 31, 2003, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $15.7 million, related to our chemical development pilot plant currently under construction at our Foster City facility. Our budgeted capital expenditures for 2004 are significantly higher and we anticipate increasing our capital spending in future years. (2) At December 31, 2003, we had firm commitments to purchase inventory related materials. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases may differ significantly from these amounts. (3) At December 31, 2003, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant expenditures are to contract research organizations. Although most contracts are cancelable, we generally have not cancelled contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. We did not create or acquire any new variable interest entities after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46, as amended, must be applied at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 48 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the U.S. as well as sales activities in Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the Euro, the British pound and the Australian dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business. To mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable. A significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced, and in the future may reduce, our U.S. dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition. Prior to 2002, we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales. In January 2002, we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in the Euro currency. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2003. All contracts have maturities of one year or less. Average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per U.S. dollar. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2003 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars in thousands): Currency Notional Amount Average Rate Fair Value December 31, 2003 British Pound $ 43,441 0.7111 $ (61 ) Euro 361,574 0.8335 (14,479 ) The total notional amount of $405.0 million and fair value of ($14.5) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2003 compares with a total notional amount of $53.5 million and fair value of ($1.1) million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2002. The significant increase in outstanding contracts from 2002 to 2003 can be attributed to our decision to expand the time horizon that we include from three months to twelve months when hedging our forecasted international sales. This decision was made due to the growth in our international business and the increasing fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the Euro. Interest Rate Risk Our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to the investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration, industry group, investment type 49 and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: Safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk; Liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and Competitive after tax rate of return. The following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest bearing assets and fixed rate liabilities at December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands). Years ending December 31, Fair ValueDecember 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total 2003 Assets Available for sale securities $ 543,119 $ 76,104 $ 9,016 $ 628,239 $ 628,239 Average interest rate 1.5 % 1.7 % 1.3 % Liabilities Long term obligations, including current portion(1) $ 7,232 $ 4,217 $ 10,610 $ 10,709 $ 10,289 $ 12,744 $ 55,801 $ 55,801 Average interest rate 13.5 % 13.8 % 14.3 % 20.7 % Convertible senior debentures $ 345,000 $ 345,000 $ 472,650 Interest rate 2.0 % (1) Long term obligations consist of capital leases and operating leases (net of noncancelable subleases). The interest portion of payments due is included. International Credit Risk Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003 was $235.2 million compared to $125.0 million at December 31, 2002. The growth was primarily due to higher product sales for Viread in the U.S. and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, our accounts receivable balances are significant. In most cases, these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers. This, in turn, may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased, and in the future may further increase, the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding. At December 31, 2003, our past due accounts receivable for Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled approximately $102.7 million, of which approximately $59.0 million was more than 120 days past due. At December 31, 2002, past due receivables for these countries were $49.7 million, of which approximately $26.6 million was more than 120 days past due. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that all accounts receivable balances as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet, including those due from customers in these four countries, are collectible. We perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally have not required collateral. 50
