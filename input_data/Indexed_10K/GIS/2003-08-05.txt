Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation General Mills is a global consumer foods company. We compete in markets around the world by developing differentiated food products that consumers recognize as superior to alternative offerings. We market our value added products under unique brand names, and build the equity of those brands with strong consumer directed advertising and innovative merchandising. We believe this brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining market share leadership. We believe that our business portfolio, expanded in fiscal 2002 with the acquisition of Pillsbury, will generate superior financial returns for our shareholders over the long term. Our financial performance is determined by how well we execute the key elements of our business model. These key business drivers are: unit volume growth, which is the single most critical element; productivity initiatives, to mitigate the effects of cost inflation; efficient utilization of capital; and prudent management of risk. This section of the Annual Report on Form 10 K discusses our critical accounting policies, the results of our operations, our liquidity and financial condition, and our risk management practices. Critical Accounting Policies For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note One to the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results, and that require significant management judgment and estimates. These policies include our accounting for (a) trade and consumer promotion activities; (b) asset impairments; (c) income taxes; and (d) pension and postretirement liabilities. The amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels. The vast majority of year end liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long term estimates. We are required to evaluate our long lived assets, including goodwill, for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired. Evaluating the impairment of long lived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets. Although the predictability of long term cash flows may be uncertain, our evaluations indicate fair values for our long lived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values. Therefore, we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low. Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. The accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors. Because changes in these estimates can have a significant impact, we have described them in more detail below in the section titled Pension Accounting. Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 The acquisition of Pillsbury, on October 31, 2001, significantly affected fiscal 2003 comparisons for our results of operations, as our fiscal 2002 results include only seven months of ownership of the Pillsbury businesses. Net earnings (including cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, adopted in fiscal 2002, as described in more detail in the section below titled New Accounting Rules) were $917 million, up 100 percent from fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $2.43 compared to $1.34 in fiscal 2002. Annual net sales rose 32 percent, to $10.5 billion, driven by a 30 percent increase in worldwide unit volume for fiscal 2003. The balance of the net sales growth was primarily attributable to promotional efficiencies. On a comparable basis, as if General Mills had owned Pillsbury for all of fiscal 2002, worldwide unit volume grew 3 percent. This performance reflects improvement in our U.S. Retail segment but was constrained by economic factors limiting growth in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment and Latin American operations in our International segment. 11 The Pillsbury acquisition materially altered our business structure. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment and International segment, which now represent larger portions of our sales and earnings, have lower gross margins than General Mills historical margins. These businesses also are generally supported with lower marketing spending as a percent of sales. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales declined from 59 percent in fiscal 2002 to 58 percent in fiscal 2003. This reduction reflects the benefit of synergies created from the Pillsbury acquisition. Increased operating leverage, defined as increased absorption of fixed operating cost as a result of higher volume levels, was offset by the incremental five months of Pillsburys business structure versus fiscal 2002 as discussed in the previous paragraph. Selling, general and administrative costs include certain infrequently occurring items. In fiscal 2003, we recorded $70 million of costs related to the planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury, including consulting, system conversions, relocation, training and communications, compared to $52 million of similar expenditures in fiscal 2002. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales were 24 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to 26 percent in 2002. The above noted infrequently occurring items increased selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales by 1 percent in both fiscal 2002 and 2003. The two percentage point year over year decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was primarily generated by synergies. Our fiscal 2003 results included restructuring and other exit costs of $62 million as discussed in more detail in Note Three to the consolidated financial statements. These were primarily severance costs and asset write downs related to plans established to accomplish the integration of Pillsbury. Our fiscal 2002 results included restructuring and other exit costs of $134 million, including charges related to the sale of our Toledo, Ohio plant to International Multifoods Corporation as required to obtain regulatory clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury, and to severance costs for sales organization and headquarters department realignment. Interest expense increased 31 percent in fiscal 2003 due to the full year impact of the additional debt associated with the Pillsbury acquisition. Average diluted shares outstanding were 378 million in fiscal 2003, up 11 percent from 342 million in fiscal 2002 due to the full year impact of shares issued to Diageo as part of the acquisition. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT. Our U.S. Retail segment includes Big G cereals, Meals, Pillsbury USA, Baking Products, Snacks, Yoplait Colombo and Small Planet Foods. Net sales for these operations totaled $7.41 billion in fiscal 2003, compared to $5.91 billion in fiscal 2002. Operating profits totaled $1.75 billion, up 66 percent from the prior year. Comparable unit volume grew 4 percent versus fiscal 2002 fueled by an increase in product and marketing innovation. All of our U.S. Retail businesses experienced volume growth except Baking Products, which declined due to significant competitive promotional activity. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment includes sales to wholesale and retail bakeries, foodservice distributors, convenience stores, vending and foodservice operators. Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice operations reached $1.80 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.26 billion in fiscal 2002, while operating profit was $156 million, up only 1 percent from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of twelve months of Pillsbury results in fiscal 2003 compared to seven months of results included in fiscal 2002. Operating profits reflect higher supply chain costs as operations were affected by manufacturing realignments from the Pillsbury merger and higher commodity costs which could not be recovered fully through pricing actions. Comparable unit volume was essentially unchanged, reflecting overall weak foodservice industry trends. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT. Our International segment includes our business in Canada, as well as our consolidated operations in Europe, the Asia/Pacific region and Latin America. Net sales for our International operations totaled $1.30 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $778 million in 2002. Operating profits grew to $91 million, more than double last years $45 million total. Comparable unit volume declined 1 percent for the year, driven by a 20 percent decline in Latin America that was almost offset by strong volumes in Canada, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. 12 PENSION ACCOUNTING. In fiscal 2003, we recorded net pension and postretirement income of $42 million, net of $6 million of curtailments, compared to $60 million, net of $11 million of curtailments, in fiscal 2002. As detailed in Note Fourteen to the consolidated financial statements, key assumptions that determine this income include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds. The discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date. That same discount rate is also used to determine pension and other postretirement income or expense for the following fiscal year. The discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 7.75 percent for the obligation as of May 27, 2001 and for our fiscal 2002 income and expense estimate, 7.50 percent for the obligation as of May 26, 2002 and for our fiscal 2003 income and expense estimate, and 6.00 percent for the obligation as of May 25, 2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense estimate. Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long term investment performance, and our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries, several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions. For fiscal 2002 and 2003, we assumed a rate of return of 10.4 percent on our pension plan assets and 10.0 percent on our other postretirement plan assets. For fiscal 2004 we have reduced our rate of return assumptions to 9.6 percent for assets in both plans. In addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets, we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets, which reduces year to year volatility in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of May 25, 2003, we had cumulative losses of approximately $1.2 billion on our pension plans and $343 million on our postretirement plans. These unrecognized net actuarial losses will result in decreases in our future pension income if they continue to exceed the corridor defined by SFAS No. 87. For our fiscal 2004 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate, we have reduced the discount rate to 6.0 percent, based on interest rates as of May 25, 2003. We have also reduced the expected rate of return on plan assets to 9.6 percent. Based on these rates and various other assumptions including the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses, we estimate that our net pension and postretirement expense, exclusive of curtailments, if any, will approximate $12 million in fiscal 2004 compared to income of $48 million, exclusive of curtailments, in fiscal 2003. Actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately $17 million. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately $22 million. Our pension plans were underfunded by $224 million as of May 25, 2003. Based on our actuarial assumptions, we expect required cash contributions of less than $10 million in fiscal 2004, and we made contributions of $9 million in fiscal 2003 and $7 million in fiscal 2002. Our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $612 million as of May 25, 2003. Based on our actuarial assumptions, we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $20 million for each of the next three years, which compares to actual cash contributions of $2 million in fiscal 2003 and $29 million in fiscal 2002. CORPORATE ITEMS. Net interest expense rose in fiscal 2003 to $547 million, which includes a full year of interest on the additional debt incurred related to the Pillsbury acquisition. During fiscal 2003 we issued approximately $2 billion of long term debt securities and used the proceeds to repay short term debt. We have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert $1.5 billion of floating rate debt to fixed rates. These swaps have an average life of one year and have an average fixed rate of 5.0 percent. As of May 25, 2003, $49 million of pretax losses from these swap contracts were recorded within accumulated other 13 comprehensive income. As explained in Note Seven to the consolidated financial statements, when we issue fixed rate debt, the corresponding interest rate swaps are dedesignated as hedges and the amount related to those swaps within accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings over the life of the interest rate swaps. Taking into account the effect of all of our interest rate swaps, the average interest rate on our total debt is approximately 5.9 percent. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 was 35 percent. JOINT VENTURES. General Mills proportionate share of joint venture net sales grew to $997 million, compared to $777 million in fiscal 2002. Total after tax earnings from joint venture operations almost doubled to reach $61 million in fiscal 2003, compared with $33 million reported a year earlier. Profits for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), our joint venture with Nestl&eacute;, and Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), our joint venture with PepsiCo, together grew to $45 million. In addition, H&auml;agen Dazs joint ventures contributed a full year of results. These profit gains were partially offset by continued marketing investment for 8th Continent, the Companys soymilk joint venture with DuPont. Results of Operations 2002 vs. 2001 General Mills completed the acquisition of The Pillsbury Company on October 31, 2001. Fiscal 2002 net sales grew 46 percent to $7.95 billion including the seven months of Pillsbury results. Worldwide volume grew 49 percent, although on a comparable basis, as if General Mills had owned Pillsbury for all of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, volume grew slightly. Earnings after tax declined 31 percent to $458 million. Net earnings per diluted share declined 41 percent to $1.34, from $2.28 in fiscal 2001. This significant reduction in General Mills earnings was caused by the initial disruption of combining General Mills and Pillsburys organizations. Total U.S. Retail comparable unit volume declined 1 percent in fiscal 2002. Volume gains in Yoplait Colombo, Snacks and Pillsbury USA were more than offset by volume declines seen in Big G cereals, Meals and Baking Products. The reduced volume resulted from the merger related disruption to our sales force and a reduced level of new products and promotional activity during the integration period. Net sales in the U.S. Retail segment grew to $5.91 billion from $4.57 billion. Operating profits were flat at $1.06 billion. Foodservice results in fiscal 2002 included comparable unit volume that was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2001. Net sales more than doubled to $1.26 billion and operating profit grew 63 percent to reach $155 million. International comparable unit volume grew 4 percent and net sales nearly tripled to $778 million. Operating profit grew from $17 million to $45 million. Impact of Inflation It is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed later in this section. Cash Flows Sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table. Over the most recent three year period, General Mills operations have generated $3.3 billion in cash. In 2003, cash flow from operations totaled $1.6 billion. That was up from the previous year due primarily to a $456 million increase in operating earnings before depreciation, amortization, restructuring and other exit costs, as well as a $209 million increase from a reduction in working capital. 14 CASH SOURCES (USES) Fiscal Year In millions 2003 2002 2001 From continuing operations $ 1,631 $ 916 $ 740 From discontinued operations (3 ) (3 ) Purchases of land, building and equipment, net (697 ) (485 ) (306 ) Investments in businesses, intangibles and affiliates, net (261 ) (3,688 ) (96 ) Change in marketable securities (6 ) 24 (28 ) Proceeds from disposition of businesses 939 Other investments, net (54 ) (61 ) (30 ) Increase (decrease) in outstanding debt, net (616 ) 5,746 183 Proceeds from minority investors 148 150 Common stock issued 96 139 107 Treasury stock purchases (29 ) (2,436 ) (226 ) Dividends paid (406 ) (358 ) (312 ) Other (78 ) 28 10 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (272 ) $ 911 $ 39 In fiscal 2003, capital investment for land, building and equipment and intangibles grew to $750 million, including expenditures for the construction of new facilities at our Minneapolis headquarters campus and expenditures associated with the acquisition and integration of Pillsbury. We expect capital expenditures to decrease in fiscal 2004, to approximately $650 million, as integration related activities are completed. Dividends in 2003 totaled $1.10 per share, a payout of 45 percent of diluted earnings per share. We intend to maintain the prevailing $1.10 annual dividend rate per share in fiscal 2004, but would expect to increase that rate in the longer term as our earnings increase. We did not repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2003, nor do we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003 General Mills paid Diageo $273 million under the Contingent Value Right (CVR) agreement that was part of the Pillsbury transaction. The CVR required General Mills to pay Diageo up to $395 million, or $5 per share on 79 million shares, depending on the price of General Mills common stock for the 20 trading days prior to April 30, 2003. In fiscal 2003 General Mills also paid $89 million to Diageo for three year call options on 29 million General Mills shares. These options were purchased in conjunction with a General Mills convertible bond offering discussed below. Financial Condition Our notes payable and total long term debt totaled $8.9 billion as of May 25, 2003. We also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure, and we use a measurement of adjusted debt plus minority interests, as shown in the table below. This adjusted debt plus minority interests declined slightly to just over $9.0 billion, and our stockholders equity grew to $4.2 billion primarily due to the increase in retained earnings. The market value of General Mills stockholders equity increased as well, due to price appreciation and the increase in shares outstanding. As of May 25, 2003, our equity market capitalization was $17.2 billion, based on a price of $46.56 per share and 370 million basic shares outstanding. 15 CAPITAL STRUCTURE In millions May 25, 2003 May 26, 2002 Notes payable $ 1,236 $ 3,600 Current portion of long term debt 105 248 Long term debt 7,516 5,591 Total debt 8,857 9,439 Debt adjustments: Deferred income taxes tax leases 68 71 Leases debt equivalent 550 423 Certain cash and cash equivalents (623 ) (894 ) Marketable investments, at cost (142 ) (135 ) Adjusted debt 8,710 8,904 Minority interests 300 153 Adjusted debt plus minority interests 9,010 9,057 Stockholders equity 4,175 3,576 Total capital $ 13,185 $ 12,633 In fiscal 2003 we refinanced approximately $2 billion of our short term debt through the following issuances: $135 million of 3.875 percent 5 year notes, $350 million of 3.9 percent 5 year bonds, $72 million of notes at various rates, and $1.50 billion of zero coupon 2 percent convertible debentures. The debentures are convertible into a total of 29 million shares of General Mills common stock. (See Note Eight to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the debenture issue.) In order to prevent share dilution in the event of conversion, we purchased call options for 29 million shares from Diageo. The purchase price for the call options was $89 million. If the owners of the debentures exercise their right of conversion, we intend to exercise our options to purchase Diageos shares so that total shares outstanding remain constant. As discussed earlier, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to lock in our interest rate on our floating rate debt. Combined, over 80 percent of our debt is now fixed rate. We consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixed rate obligations. The next table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table, shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments. DEBT STRUCTURE In millions May 25, 2003 May 26, 2002 Floating rate $ 985 11 % $ 602 7 % Fixed rate 7,407 82 7,961 88 Leases debt equivalent 550 6 423 4 Deferred income taxes tax leases 68 1 71 1 Adjusted debt plus minority interests $ 9,010 100 % $ 9,057 100 % At the end of fiscal 2003, approximately 75 percent of our adjusted debt plus minority interests was long term. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short term financing. We can issue commercial paper in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe, through a program established in fiscal 1999. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.2 billion in committed credit lines. Currently, we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines. Additionally, we have $221 million in uncommitted credit lines available. The following table details the fee paid credit lines we had available as of May 25, 2003. 16 COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES Amount Expiration Core Facilities $1.1 billion January 2004 $1.1 billion January 2006 Total Credit Lines $2.2 billion Our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2003 was 3.2 times compared to 2.5 times in fiscal 2002. We expect to pay down at least $450 million of debt in 2004, as part of a cumulative $2.0 billion reduction in adjusted debt planned over the next three years through fiscal 2006. Our goal is to return to a mid single A rating for our long term debt, and to the top tier short term rating, where we were prior to our announcement of the Pillsbury acquisition. Currently, Standard and Poors Corporation has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long term debt and A 2 on our commercial paper. Moodys Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of Baa2 for our long term debt and P 2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings, Inc. rates our long term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F 2. Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada currently rates General Mills as A low. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations It is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties. We have, however, issued guarantees of approximately $172 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily CPW and SVE. In addition, off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled approximately $454 million at May 25, 2003. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer directed marketing commitments that support our brands. In Millions, Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2004 2005 06 2007 08 2009 andThereafter Long term debt $ 7,621 $ 105 $ 285 $ 2,124 $ 5,107 Operating leases 454 69 117 96 172 Purchase obligations 1,761 1,473 179 74 35 Total $ 9,836 $ 1,647 $ 581 $ 2,294 $ 5,314 New Accounting Rules Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation Number 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees, as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe that the adoption of FIN 45 requires any material change in our guarantee disclosures. (See Note Seventeen to the consolidated financial statements.) We have not entered into any recordable guarantees since December 31, 2002. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this Standard affects the timing of the recognition of future exit or disposal costs, as no exit or disposal activities were initiated after December 31, 2002. 17 On the first day of fiscal 2002, we adopted three new accounting rules. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging. We recorded the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal 2002, as described in Note One (O) to the consolidated financial statements. We also adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The third Statement we adopted at the start of fiscal 2002 was SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. This Statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment. Goodwill amortization expense in fiscal 2001 totaled $23 million pretax, $22 million after tax. Transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values. The effects on net earnings and earnings per share for the adoption of SFAS No. 142 are described in Note One (O) to the consolidated financial statements. The FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products, requires recording certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues and was effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Since adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of certain expenses from selling, general and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales, it did not affect our financial position or net earnings. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. We use the intrinsic value method of accounting, and have not elected the fair value based method of accounting. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation, as reflected in Note One (L) to the consolidated financial statements. Finally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure about those effects in future interim financial information. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Many of these instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or as an asset in some circumstances. This Statement applies to three types of freestanding financial instruments, other than outstanding shares. One type is mandatorily redeemable shares, which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or assets; a second type includes put options and forward purchase contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets; the third type is obligations that can be settled with shares, the monetary value of which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index, or varies inversely with the value of the issuers shares. SFAS No. 150 does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. For us, it will be implemented in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the Statement and still existing at the beginning of that period. Restatement is not permitted. The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. Market Risk Management Our Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are highly rated financial institutions. Our hedging transactions include (but are not limited to) the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments. We use derivatives only where there is an underlying exposure; we do not use them for trading or speculative purposes. Additional information regarding our use of financial instruments is included in Note Seven to the consolidated financial statements. 18 Interest Rates. We manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, and through the use of derivatives. We use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount. Our primary exposure is to U.S. interest rates. As of May 25, 2003, we had $10.5 billion of agreed notional principal amounts (the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated) outstanding, including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps (see Notes Seven and Eight to the consolidated financial statements). Foreign Currency Rates. Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates. These contracts function as hedges, since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate. Our primary exchange rate exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Commodities. Certain ingredients used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes. We manage this risk through an integrated set of financial instruments, including purchase orders, noncancelable contracts, futures contracts, futures options and swaps. Our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains, sugar, vegetables, fruits, other agricultural products, vegetable oils, packaging materials and energy costs. Value at Risk. These estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value General Mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices, under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. The VAR calculation used historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics(TM) data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards and options; and commodity swaps, futures and options. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments. The table below presents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding on May 25, 2003. The amounts were calculated using the VAR methodology described earlier.
