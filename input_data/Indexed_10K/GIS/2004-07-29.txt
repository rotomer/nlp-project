ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General Mills is a global consumer foods company. We develop differentiated food products and market these value added products under unique brand names. We work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our businesses are organized into three segments. Our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately 70 percent of our fiscal 2004 net sales, and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, specialty stores, drug and discount chains, and mass merchandisers operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready to eat cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic foods. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment generated approximately 16 percent of fiscal 2004 net sales. This business segment consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries, and to commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators throughout the United States and Canada. The remaining 14 percent of our fiscal 2004 net sales was generated by our consolidated International businesses. These include a retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. retail product mix, along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key markets in Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region. In addition to these consolidated operations, we participate in several joint ventures. We record our proportionate share of after tax earnings or losses from these ventures. In fiscal 2004, joint ventures accounted for $74 million of our after tax earnings. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term by delivering consistent growth in sales and earnings, coupled with an attractive dividend yield. We have met this objective over the most recent five year period (fiscal 1999 to 2004), as General Mills total return to shareholders has averaged 5 percent while the S&P 500 Index has posted a negative 2 percent average annual return over this period. However, in the most recent fiscal year the 22 percent return of the S&P 500 Index outperformed our 1 percent return. We achieved good sales and earnings gains in fiscal 2004, which included the benefit of an extra week. For the 53 week period ended May 30, 2004, our net sales grew 5 percent and diluted earnings per share grew 13 percent. Details of our financial results are provided in the Results of Operations section below. Our cash flow in 2004 was strong, enabling us to pay out almost 40 percent of earnings as dividends, make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity, and reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by $572 million (see definition of adjusted debt on page 14 of this report). We have prioritized debt repayment as a use of cash for the three year period through fiscal 2006. Our goal is to reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by a cumulative $2 billion by the end of 2006, and thereby improve our fixed charge coverage to the levels we demonstrated prior to our acquisition of Pillsbury in October 2001. While our earnings results in 2004 were good overall, they fell short of our initial expectations for the year due to three principal factors. First, higher commodity costs reduced our gross margin. Second, the recent popularity of low carbohydrate diets slowed sales in several of our major product categories. And finally, our Bakeries and Foodservice business fell well short of targeted results, due in part to the low carbohydrate trend and higher supply chain costs. These results also reflect disruption caused by our own manufacturing realignment actions and decisions to eliminate low margin product lines in a number of customer categories. In fiscal 2005, we face several challenges that will hinder earnings growth. The first obvious hurdle is the fact that we 9 will have one less week of business in 2005 going up against 53 week results in 2004. But beyond that, commodity prices continue to rise our 2005 business plan assumes a significant increase in commodity costs compared to our 2004 expense. Energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher. And from an operations perspective, we need to stabilize trends in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. To partially offset the higher input costs we are experiencing, we have increased list prices on certain product lines. We also plan to increase merchandised price points for certain products. However, these actions wont entirely cover our increased costs. We plan to capture additional supply chain productivity during 2005, and we will continue to control administrative costs companywide. We also have identified opportunities to reconfigure certain manufacturing activities to improve our cost structure. We believe the key driver of our results in 2005 will be the success of our product innovation, which is critical to achieving unit volume growth. Our business plans include new product activity and innovations that respond to consumers interest in health and nutrition, convenience and new flavor varieties. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2004 vs. 2003 Net sales for the company increased 5 percent for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2003. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week, net sales increased 4 percent. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales GrowthFiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +2 pts 53rd week +1 pt Price/Product Mix/Foreign Currency Exchange +3 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 1 pt Net Sales Growth +5% The unit volume growth in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately $130 million in gross margin improvement (net sales less cost of sales) over fiscal 2003. However, gross margin increased by only $89 million. Increased cost of sales, driven primarily by more than $100 million in commodity cost increases, could not be fully covered by net pricing realization. As a result, gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 42 percent in fiscal 2003 to 41 percent in fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $29 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, driven by a $36 million decrease in merger related costs. These merger related costs are infrequently occurring items related to the planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury, including consulting, system conversions, relocation, training and communications. Net interest expense decreased 7 percent from $547 million in fiscal 2003 to $508 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to favorable interest rates. We have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert $79 million of floating rate debt to fixed rates. Our portfolio of interest rate swaps has an average life of 4.0 years and has an average fixed rate of 5.3 percent. Taking into account the effect of all of our interest rate swaps, the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt as of May 30, 2004 was approximately 5.8 percent. Restructuring and other exit costs were $26 million in fiscal 2004, as described in more detail in Note Three to the consolidated financial statements. Approximately $11 million was related to plant closures in the Netherlands, Brazil and California. We recorded an additional $7 million primarily related to adjustments of costs associated with previously announced closures of manufacturing facilities. In addition, we recorded $8 million for severance, primarily related to realignment actions in our Bakeries and Foodservice organization. Our fiscal 2003 results included restructuring and other exit costs of $62 million. These costs also are discussed in Note Three. Our effective income tax rate was 35 percent in fiscal 2004 and 2003. After tax earnings from joint venture operations grew 21 percent to reach $74 million in fiscal 2004, compared with $61 million reported a year earlier. Profits for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), our joint venture with Nestl&eacute;, and Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), our joint venture with PepsiCo, together grew to $58 million, 29 percent higher than last years profits. H&auml;agen Dazs joint ventures profits were partially offset by continued marketing investment for 8th Continent, the Companys soy products joint venture with DuPont. These two ventures combined for $16 million of profit. General Mills proportionate share of joint venture net sales grew to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2003. Average diluted shares outstanding were 384 million in fiscal 2004, up 2 percent from 378 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to stock option exercises. Net income increased to $1,055 million in fiscal 2004, from $917 million in 2003. Net income per diluted share of $2.75 in 2004 was up 13 percent from $2.43 in 2003 as a result of the increased income from operations. We exceeded our debt reduction goal for the year, retiring $572 million of 10 adjusted debt plus minority interests, a key internal measure that we define in our Capital Structure table on page 14. Operating Segment Results U.S. Retail Segment Net sales for our U.S. Retail operations totaled $7.76 billion in fiscal 2004, compared to $7.41 billion in fiscal 2003. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of U.S. Retail Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +2 pts 53rd week +2 pts Price/Product Mix +2 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 1 pt Net Sales Growth +5% Unit volume grew 4 percent versus fiscal 2003 fueled by an increase in product and marketing innovation. Without the 53rd week, unit volume grew 2 percent. All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced volume growth for the year: U.S. Retail Unit Volume Growth Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Yoplait +10 % Snacks +5 Baking Products +4 Meals +3 Pillsbury USA +2 Big G Cereals +2 Total U.S. Retail +4 % 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +2 % Big G cereal volume grew 2 percent in 2004, with contributions from new products including Berry Burst Cheerios, and gains by several key established brands such as Honey Nut Cheerios and Reeses Puffs. Yoplait yogurt volume increased 10 percent with continued growth from established lines plus contributions from Yoplait Nouriche yogurt beverages. Snacks division volume was up 5 percent, led by growth in fruit snacks and granola bars. Meals division unit volume rose 3 percent with contributions from the line of Progresso Rich & Hearty soups introduced during the year, and from Betty Crocker dinner mixes. Unit volume growth of 2 percent for Pillsbury USA reflected gains for Totinos pizza and hot snacks, frozen breakfast items (toaster strudel, waffles) and frozen baked goods. Baking Products division unit volume was up 4 percent. Retail dollar sales for the Companys major brands also grew 2 percent overall on a 52 vs. 52 week basis as measured by ACNielsen plus projections for Wal Mart: Retail Dollar Sales Growth (52 vs. 52 week Basis)Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 General MillsRetail SalesGrowth Composite Retail Sales +2 % Major Product Lines: Grain Snacks +12% Ready to serve Soup +12 Refrigerated Yogurt +6 Dessert Mixes +4 Dry Dinners +3 Fruit Snacks +2 Ready to eat Cereals 2 Refrigerated Dough 3 Source: ACNielsen plus Wal Mart Projections The unit volume growth in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately $125 million in gross margin improvement over fiscal 2003, but gross margin increased by only $54 million. Increased cost of sales, driven primarily by more than $90 million in commodity cost increases, could not be fully covered by net pricing realization. As a result, gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 48 percent in fiscal 2003 to 46 percent in fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $1 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. Operating profits grew to $1.81 billion, up from $1.75 billion in fiscal 2003. 11 Bakeries and Foodservice Segment Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice operations fell to $1.76 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.80 billion in fiscal 2003. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Bakeries and Foodservice Net SalesGrowth Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) 4 pts 53rd week +1 pt Price/Product Mix +2 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 1 pt Net Sales Growth 2% Unit volume was down 3 percent, or down 4 percent on a comparable basis, reflecting softness in our bakery business due to the popularity of diets low in carbohydrates and elimination of low margin product lines. Unit volume by major customer category was: Bakeries and Foodservice Unit Volume GrowthFiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Convenience Stores/Vending +14 % Distributors/Restaurants +1 Wholesale/In store Bakery 11 Total Bakeries and Foodservice 3 % 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) 4 % The unit volume decline in fiscal 2004 reduced gross margin by approximately $11 million compared to 2003. However, gross margin declined by $46 million. Increased cost of sales, driven primarily by $35 million in increased manufacturing expense, could not be fully covered by net pricing realization. As a result, gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 25 percent in fiscal 2003 to 23 percent in fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $22 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, driven primarily by an $8 million reduction in consumer marketing expense and an $8 million reduction in general administrative expense. Operating profits fell from $156 million in fiscal 2003 to $132 million in fiscal 2004. International Segment Net sales for our International operations totaled $1.55 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.30 billion in 2003. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of International Net Sales GrowthFiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +4 pts 53rd week +1 pt Price/Product Mix +7 pts Foreign Currency Exchange +11 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 4 pts Net Sales Growth +19% Unit volume grew 5 percent for the year and comparable 52 week volume was up 4 percent. Canada and export operations each had 53 week years; our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America are reported on a 12 calendar month basis ended April 30, and therefore did not have the benefit of the 53rd week. International unit volume growth was driven by 12 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region: International Unit Volume GrowthFiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 Asia/Pacific +12 % Canada +6 Europe +2 Latin America Consolidated International +5 % 52 vs. 52 week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +4 % Using constant exchange rates to translate components of earnings, the unit volume increase in fiscal 2004 improved gross margin by approximately $20 million; total gross margin increased by $32 million, as net price realization maintained gross margin as a percent of sales; selling, general and administrative costs increased $18 million; and operating profit increased $14 million, or 15 percent over fiscal 2003. Operating profits including the effects of foreign currency rate changes grew to $119 million, 31 percent above last years $91 million. 12 Unallocated Corporate Expense Unallocated corporate expense decreased from $76 million in fiscal 2003 to $17 million in fiscal 2004, driven primarily by a $36 million decrease in merger related costs as the integration of Pillsbury was completed during the year. Joint Ventures Our share of after tax joint venture earnings increased from $61 million in fiscal 2003 to $74 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to unit volume gains, as follows: Joint Ventures Unit Volume GrowthFiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 CPW +9% SVE +4 H&auml;agen Dazs +3 8th Continent NM Total Joint Ventures +8% Our joint ventures do not share our fiscal year, and therefore did not have the benefit of a 53rd week in fiscal 2004. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2003 vs. 2002 The acquisition of Pillsbury, on Oct. 31, 2001, significantly affected fiscal 2003 comparisons for our results of operations, as our fiscal 2002 results include only seven months of ownership of the Pillsbury businesses. Net earnings (including cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, adopted in fiscal 2002, as described in more detail in the section below titled New Accounting Rules) were $917 million, up 100 percent from fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share were $2.43 compared to $1.34 in fiscal 2002. Annual net sales rose 32 percent, to $10.5 billion, driven by a 30 percent increase in worldwide unit volume for fiscal 2003. The balance of the net sales growth was primarily attributable to promotional efficiencies. On a comparable basis, as if General Mills had owned Pillsbury for all of fiscal 2002, worldwide unit volume grew 3 percent. This performance reflected improvement in our U.S. Retail segment, but was constrained by economic factors limiting growth in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment and Latin American operations in our International segment. U.S. Retail unit volume comparable for Pillsbury grew 4 percent in fiscal 2003. All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced volume growth except Baking Products, which declined due to significant competitive promotional activity. Net sales for these operations totaled $7.41 billion in fiscal 2003, compared to $5.91 billion in fiscal 2002. Operating profits totaled $1.75 billion, up 66 percent from the prior year. Bakeries and Foodservice results in fiscal 2003 included unit volume comparable for Pillsbury that was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2002, reflecting overall weak foodservice industry trends. Net sales reached $1.80 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.26 billion in fiscal 2002, while operating profit was $156 million, up only 1 percent from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of twelve months of Pillsbury results in fiscal 2003 compared to seven months of results included in fiscal 2002. International unit volume comparable for Pillsbury declined 1 percent in fiscal 2003, driven by a 20 percent decline in Latin America that was nearly offset by volume growth in Canada, Europe and Asia. Net sales totaled $1.30 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $778 million in 2002, and operating profits grew to $91 million, more than double the prior years $45 million total. IMPACT OF INFLATION It is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years other than as noted above related to commodities. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our market risk management practices are discussed later in this section. CASH FLOWS Sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table. Over the most recent three year period, General Mills operations have generated $4.0 billion in cash. In 2004, cash flow from operations totaled nearly $1.5 billion. That was down from the previous year as a $218 million increase in operating earnings before depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes and restructuring and other exit costs was more than offset by an increase in working capital of $186 million in 2004 versus a decrease of $246 million in 2003. The increase in the use of working capital in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to three factors. One of the factors was that the accounts payable balance as of May 30, 2004 was $158 million below last years balance primarily due to lower accrued liabilities, such as trade promotion liabilities, driven by faster cash payments. A second factor was a reduction in miscellaneous other current liabilities of $119 million due primarily to payments against integration and restructuring liabilities. The third factor was net income tax payments in 2004 of $225 million versus net payments of $139 million in 2003. 13 Cash Sources (Uses) Fiscal Year (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 From continuing operations $ 1,461 $ 1,631 $ 916 From discontinued operations (3 ) Purchases of land, buildings and equipment, net (592 ) (697 ) (485 ) Investments in businesses, intangibles and affiliates, net (2 ) (261 ) (3,688 ) Change in marketable securities 122 (6 ) 24 Proceeds from disposition of businesses 939 Other investments, net 2 (54 ) (61 ) Increase (decrease) in outstanding debt, net (695 ) (616 ) 5,746 Proceeds from minority investors 148 150 Common stock issued 192 96 139 Treasury stock purchases (24 ) (29 ) (2,436 ) Dividends paid (413 ) (406 ) (358 ) Other (3 ) (78 ) 28 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 48 $ (272 ) $ 911 In fiscal 2004, capital investment for land, buildings and equipment, and intangibles fell to $653 million from $750 million last year, and included expenditures for the completion of new facilities at our Minneapolis headquarters campus and expenditures associated with the acquisition and integration of Pillsbury. We expect capital expenditures to decrease further in fiscal 2005, to between $450 and $500 million. Dividends in 2004 totaled $1.10 per share, a payout of 40 percent of diluted earnings per share. The board of directors announced a 13 percent increase in dividends to an annual rate of $1.24 per share, effective with the dividend payable on Aug. 2, 2004. We did not repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2004, nor do we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2005. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our notes payable and total long term debt totaled $8.2 billion as of May 30, 2004. We also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure, and we use a measurement of adjusted debt plus minority interests, as shown in the table below. This adjusted debt plus minority interests declined by $572 million, to $8.4 billion, and our stockholders equity grew to $5.2 billion. The market value of General Mills stockholders equity increased as well, as an increase in shares outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in share price. As of May 30, 2004, our equity market capitalization was $17.5 billion, based on a price of $46.05 per share and 379 million basic shares outstanding. Our total market capitalization, including adjusted debt, minority interests and equity capital, fell from $26.2 billion as of May 25, 2003 to $25.9 billion as of May 30, 2004. Capital Structure (In millions) May 30,2004 May 25,2003 Notes payable $ 583 $ 1,236 Current portion of long term debt 233 105 Long term debt 7,410 7,516 Total debt $ 8,226 $ 8,857 Debt adjustments: Deferred income taxes tax leases 66 68 Leases debt equivalent 600 550 Certain cash and cash equivalents (699 ) (623 ) Marketable investments, at cost (54 ) (142 ) Adjusted debt $ 8,139 $ 8,710 Minority interests 299 300 Adjusted debt plus minority interests $ 8,438 $ 9,010 Stockholders equity 5,248 4,175 Total capital $ 13,686 $ 13,185 In fiscal 2004 we refinanced $575 million of our short term debt through the following issuances: $500 million of 2 percent 3 year notes that were subsequently swapped to 1 month LIBOR plus 11 basis points, and a $75 million 5 year term loan at 1 month LIBOR plus 15 basis points. We consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixed rate obligations. The next table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table, shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments. 14 Debt Structure (In millions) May 30, 2004 May 25, 2003 Floating rate $ 1,169 14 % $ 985 11 % Fixed rate 6,603 78 7,407 82 Leases debt equivalent 600 7 550 6 Deferred income taxes tax leases 66 1 68 1 Adjusted debt plus minority interests $ 8,438 100 % $ 9,010 100 % At the end of fiscal 2004, approximately 85 percent of our adjusted debt plus minority interests was long term. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short term financing. We can issue commercial paper in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe, through a program established in fiscal 1999. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $1.85 billion in committed credit lines. Currently, we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines. The following table details the fee paid credit lines we had available as of May 30, 2004. Committed Credit Facilities Amount Expiration Core Facilities $0.75 billion January 2009 $1.10 billion January 2006 Total Credit Lines $1.85 billion On June 23, 2004, we filed a Universal Shelf Registration Statement (the shelf) with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the sale of up to $5.943 billion of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units and units (all described in the shelf). In addition, the shelf covers resales of an aggregate of 49,907,680 shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate of Diageo plc. When the shelf becomes effective, our existing shelf registration will be incorporated therein. We believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratios of fixed charge coverage and cash flow to adjusted debt plus minority interests. Our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2004 was 3.8 times compared to 3.2 times in fiscal 2003, and cash flow to adjusted debt plus minority interests was 20 percent compared to 15 percent in fiscal 2003. We expect to pay down at least $625 million of adjusted debt plus minority interests in fiscal 2005, as part of a cumulative $2.0 billion reduction in adjusted debt plus minority interests planned over the three year period ending in fiscal 2006. Our goal is to return to a mid single A rating for our long term debt, and to the top tier short term rating, where we were prior to our announcement of the Pillsbury acquisition. Currently, Standard and Poors Corporation has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long term debt and A 2 on our commercial paper. Moodys Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of Baa2 for our long term debt and P 2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings, Inc. rates our long term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F 2. Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada currently rates General Mills as A low. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS It is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties. We have, however, issued guarantees of approximately $199 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily CPW and SVE. In addition, off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled approximately $435 million at May 30, 2004. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer directed marketing commitments that support our brands. Information concerning other long term liabilities that consist primarily of retirement and other postretirement benefits and the fair value of outstanding interest hedges has been provided in Note Fourteen and Note Seven, respectively.

Our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results, and that may require significant management judgment and estimates. These policies include 15 our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities; asset impairments; income taxes; and pension and postretirement liabilities. Trade and Consumer Promotion Activities We report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs. The trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in store displays, discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices, and payments to gain distribution of new products. The amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels. The vast majority of year end liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long term estimates. For interim reporting, we estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata period expense generally in proportion to revenue, adjusted for estimated year to date expenditures if greater than the pro rata amount. Certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as reductions of net sales. Promotional funds for our retail businesses are initially established at the beginning of each year, and paid out over the course of the year based on the customers performance of agreed upon merchandising activity. During the year, additional funds may also be used in response to competitive activities, as a result of changes in the mix of our marketing support, or to help achieve interim unit volume targets. We set annual sales objectives and interim targets as a regular practice to manage our business. Our sales employees are salaried, and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on performance against objectives set at the start of the year. These objectives include goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal. Our sales employees have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity over the course of the year, and they also have some discretion to adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular event. Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days worth of incremental shipments (based on a five day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. This increased sales activity results in shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or authorized pursuant to pre arranged inventory management agreements, and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter. The two to four day range of increased unit volume in the last week of each quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the last three years. As part of our effort to assess the results of our promotional activities, we regularly estimate the amount of retailer inventory in the system defined as product that we have shipped to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by the end consumer. While it is not possible for us to measure the absolute level of inventory, we are able to estimate the change that occurs each month by comparing our shipments to retail customers with their sales to end consumers (takeaway) as reported by ACNielsen. Our estimate indicates inventory levels peak in November when retailers have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like refrigerated dough and ready to serve soup. This seasonal trend is generally consistent from year to year, even as retailers have taken actions to reduce their ongoing inventory levels. We also assess the effectiveness of our promotional activities by evaluating the end consumer purchases of our products subsequent to the reporting period. If, due to quarter end promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end consumer demand will require in future periods, then our sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely affected. As part of our ongoing evaluation of sales, we also monitor customer returns. We generally do not allow a right of return on our products. However, on a limited case by case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return products in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets. These returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return. Monthly returns are consistently below 1 percent of sales, and have averaged approximately 0.5 percent of total monthly shipments over the last three years. Asset Impairments We are required to evaluate our long lived assets, including goodwill, for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired. Evaluating the impairment of long lived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets. Although the predictability of long term cash flows may be uncertain, our evaluations indicate fair values for our long lived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values. Therefore, we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low. 16 Income Taxes Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items. Pension Accounting The accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors. As detailed in Note Fourteen to the consolidated financial statements, key assumptions that determine this income include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds. The discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date. That same discount rate also is used to determine pension and other postretirement income or expense for the following fiscal year. Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long term investment performance, our estimate of future long term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and long term inflation assumptions. In addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets, we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. This market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets. Since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of May 30, 2004, we had cumulative losses of approximately $770 million on our pension plans and $307 million on our postretirement plans. These unrecognized net actuarial losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106. In fiscal 2004, we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of $5 million compared to $42 million of income in fiscal 2003, net of $6 million of curtailments. The discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 7.5 percent for the obligation as of May 26, 2002 and for our fiscal 2003 income and expense estimate, and 6.0 percent for the obligation as of May 25, 2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense estimate. For fiscal 2003 we assumed a rate of return of 10.4 percent on our pension plan assets and 10.0 percent on our other postretirement plan assets. For fiscal 2004 we reduced our rate of return assumptions to 9.6 percent for assets in both plans. For our fiscal 2005 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate, we have increased the discount rate to 6.65 percent, based on interest rates as of May 30, 2004. The expected rate of return on plan assets remains 9.6 percent. Based on these rates and various other assumptions including the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses, we estimate that our net pension and postretirement expense, exclusive of curtailments, if any, will approximate $20 million in fiscal 2005 compared to expense of $5 million, exclusive of curtailments, in fiscal 2004. Actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans. Lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2005 by approximately $18 million. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2005 by approximately $23 million. NEW ACCOUNTING RULES On the first day of fiscal 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging. We recorded the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal 2002, as follows: In millions, Except Per Share Data Included InEarnings Included inAccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncome Pretax $ (5 ) $ (251 ) Income tax effects 2 93 Total $ (3 ) $ (158 ) Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share $ (.01 ) 17 This cumulative effect was primarily associated with the impact of lower interest rates on the fair value calculation for delayed starting interest rate swaps we entered into in anticipation of our Pillsbury acquisition and other financing requirements. Refer to Note Seven and Note Ten for more information. On the first day of fiscal 2002, we also adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The third Statement we adopted at the start of fiscal 2002 was SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. This Statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment. Transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products, which requires recording certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues. Since adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of certain expenses from selling, general and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales, it did not affect our financial position or net earnings. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation Number 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees, as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not require any material change in our guarantee disclosures (see Note Seventeen). In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The adoption of this Standard affected the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs for disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. We have not elected the fair value based method of accounting. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation, as reflected in Note One (L) to the consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or as an asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 was implemented in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires that interests in variable interest entities that are considered to be special purpose entities be included in the financial statements for the year ended May 30, 2004. FIN 46 was implemented in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The revision to SFAS No. 132 requires additional disclosures for pension and other postretirement benefits plans, which are presented in Note Fourteen Retirement And Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) was signed into law on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare. Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position 106 2 (FSP 106 2) provides accounting guidance related to the Act. We adopted FSP 106 2 at the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note Fourteen Retirement and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. 18 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Our Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are highly rated institutions. Our hedging transactions include (but are not limited to) the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments. We use derivatives only where there is an underlying exposure; we do not use them for trading or speculative purposes. Additional information regarding our use of financial instruments is included in Note Seven to the consolidated financial statements. Interest Rates We manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, and through the use of derivatives. We use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount. Our primary exposure is to U.S. interest rates. As of May 30, 2004, we had $10.2 billion of agreed notional principal amounts (the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated) outstanding, including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps (see Notes Seven and Eight to the consolidated financial statements). Foreign Currency Rates Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates. These contracts function as hedges, since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate. Our primary exchange rate exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Commodities Certain ingredients used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes. We manage this risk through an integrated set of financial instruments, including purchase orders, noncancelable contracts, futures contracts, futures options and swaps. Our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains, vegetables, dairy products, sugar, vegetable oils, meats, fruits, other agricultural products, packaging materials and energy costs. Value at Risk These estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value General Mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices, under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. The VAR calculation used historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetricsTM data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; and commodity swaps, futures and options. The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments. The table below presents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding on May 30, 2004. The amounts were calculated using the VAR methodology described earlier.
