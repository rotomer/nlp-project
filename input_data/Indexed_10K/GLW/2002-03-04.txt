Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cornings financial results in 2001 deteriorated significantly from 2000 as capital spending in the telecommunications industry diminished, the demand for premium fiber declined considerably in the second quarter and the downturn in the U.S. economy in the latter half of the year negatively impacted all of Cornings businesses. As a result, sales and earnings fell in all three of Cornings operating segments. Corning impaired goodwill and other intangible assets in its photonic technologies business totaling approximately $4.8 billion and recorded $333 million to write down excess and obsolete inventory. As a result of the declining performance and expectations, management took several steps throughout the year to reduce its cost structure. Those actions included the following: incurred pre tax charges of $961 million related to actions to reduce overall headcount by approximately 12,000 employees and impair long lived assets including the closing of seven major plants, primarily in the Telecommunications and Advanced Materials Segments, idled fiber manufacturing facilities for most of the fourth quarter, and reduced capital expenditures in 2001 from the originally planned investment of $2.5 billion to $1.8 billion and lowered the capital budget for 2002 to under $500 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated net sales for 2001 were $6.3 billion, a 12% decrease from 2000. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Cornings consolidated sales in 2001 decreased 16% compared to 2000. Sales declines for 2001 occurred in all operating segments, but were most pronounced in the Telecommunications Segment where sales fell 14%. Consolidated sales for 2000 were $7.1 billion, a 50% increase over 1999 sales of $4.7 billion. Excluding acquisitions, sales in 2000 increased 36% over 1999. In 2001, Corning incurred a loss from continuing operations of $5.5 billion, or $5.89 per share, compared with income from continuing operations of $409 million, or $0.46 per share, in 2000 and income from continuing operations of $511 million, or $0.65 per share, in 1999. The 2001 loss is largely attributable to a charge of approximately $4.8 billion ($4.7 billion after tax) in the second quarter to impair goodwill and certain other intangible assets of the photonic technologies business. Cornings results for the year were also impacted by charges for restructuring actions of $961 million ($590 million after tax and minority interest) which included charges for headcount reductions, exit costs and impairment of plant and equipment. Further discussion of these charges begins under Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Restructuring Actions and Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corning recorded an operating charge of $273 million ($184 million after tax) in the second quarter to write down excess and obsolete inventory, primarily in the photonic technologies business. Corning recorded operating charges totaling $178 million ($109 million after tax) in the fourth quarter for the following: $90 million related to the release of restrictions on shares of Corning common stock held by employees, $60 million to write down excess and obsolete inventory in the photonic technologies business, and $28 million to write down an investment in intellectual property. 12 Income and earnings per share from continuing operations declined 20% and 29%, respectively, between 2000 and 1999 primarily due to substantial non cash acquisition related charges incurred in 2000. The charges included gains and losses on the disposition and restructuring of businesses, purchased in process research and development (IPRD) charges, other acquisition related charges and impairment losses. In addition, as a result of its acquisition strategy, Corning began to record significant amounts of amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill in 2000. These amounts increased in 2001 despite the impairment charges. See Non Segment Results for a discussion of these items. Corning believes a better understanding of the changes in its operating results is provided by comparing its operating results on a pro forma basis. Corning retroactively changed its definition of pro forma net income in the fourth quarter of 2001 to include the amortization of purchased intangibles in the calculation of pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share. Pro forma results for 2000 and 1999 have been restated for the change and are presented below. Pro forma net income excludes impairment and amortization of goodwill, impairment of other intangible assets, restructuring actions, purchased IPRD charges, one time acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring items. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data. Pro forma net income in 2001 totaled $157 million, or $0.17 per share, a decrease of 85% and 86%, respectively, from 2000. Pro forma net income in 2000 was $1.1 billion, or $1.22 per share, an increase of 106% and 83%, respectively, over 1999. Corning calculates pro forma net income from (loss) income from continuing operations as follows (after tax and minority interest; in millions): Years ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Loss) income from continuing operations $ (5,498) $ 409 $ 511 Nonoperating gains (4) (9) Amortization of goodwill 344 202 18 In process research and development charges 400 Other acquisition related charges 43 Impairment and restructuring charges 5,311 1 Gain in equity in earnings of associated companies (11) Impairment of equity investment 36 Pro forma net income $ 157 $ 1,075 $ 521 Pro forma diluted earnings per share $ 0.17 $ 1.22 $ 0.66 The decrease in pro forma net income in 2001 was primarily due to lower sales volumes, charges for inventory write downs and stock compensation charges. Cornings results for 2001 weakened significantly over the course of the year. Quarterly revenues and pro forma net income (loss) were as follows (in millions): Qtr. 1 Qtr. 2 Qtr. 3 Qtr. 4 Revenue $1,921 $1,868 $1,509 $ 974 Pro forma net income (loss) $ 268 $ 74 $ 76 $(261) The first half of the year was impacted as capital spending in the North American long haul sector declined, thus lowering demand for premium fiber and photonic products used in new networks. The situation intensified in the third quarter as carriers in North America and other regions began to delay purchases of single mode fiber, particularly in September. Finally, Cornings businesses in Advanced Materials and Information Display also began experiencing the effects of a slowing U.S. economy as the events of September 11th disrupted the markets and the economy even further. 13 OUTLOOK Corning believes that 2002 will be a very challenging year as industry conditions experienced in the second half of 2001 extend into 2002. Management expects first quarter revenues to approximate the fourth quarter of 2001. Management does not expect recovery to begin until late 2002, or early 2003. As a result, management expects sales for 2002 to be significantly below 2001 levels and anticipates Corning will continue to incur losses in the short term. Corning expects to realize cost savings from restructuring actions taken in 2001; however, these improvements may be offset by pricing pressures in several key businesses. Management believes Corning has ample liquidity to meet its funding needs for 2002. Corning finished the year with $2.2 billion in cash and short term investments and an unused revolving credit facility of $2.0 billion. Managements focus in 2002 will be to reduce Cornings cash requirements to manageable levels and restore its operations to profitability. Cornings long term strategy remains unchanged. Corning will continue to make significant investments in research and development for all segments and will invest in the expansion of the liquid crystal display business and the development of diesel substrates during this industry downturn. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS During the first half of 2001, Corning experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of its Telecommunications Segment, primarily in the photonic technologies business, due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry. During the second quarter, major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. As a result, management determined that the growth prospects of this business were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods. Corning reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. As a result of the business conditions noted above, Corning concluded such an assessment was required for its photonic technologies business in the second quarter. Corning assesses recoverability of the carrying value based upon cumulative expected future pre tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. As a result of this test, Corning determined that the long lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles acquired from Pirelli in December 2000, as well as those of the unit into which NetOptix Corporation (acquired in May 2000) had been integrated, were not recoverable. Cornings policy is to write down long lived assets to fair value in such circumstances. Management estimated fair value using several techniques. While each method generated comparable fair values, management adjusted the assets to estimates based on average multiples of forecasted revenues and earnings of comparable publicly traded companies with operations in the optical component market segment. In the second quarter, Corning recorded pre tax charges of $4,648 million to impair a significant portion of goodwill and $116 million to impair other intangible assets. Of the total charge of $4,764 million, $3,154 million related to the acquisition of the Pirelli optical components and devices business (the Pirelli transaction) and $1,610 million related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of NetOptix Corporation. RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS Corning has approved and executed several restructuring actions throughout the year. These actions and the charges relating to them are described below. In the first quarter of 2001, Corning reduced its workforce by approximately 3,300 positions, primarily in the photonic technologies and hardware and equipment businesses. These workforce reductions included mostly hourly production workers and resulted in minimal severance charges. In April 2001, Corning completed an additional workforce reduction of approximately 1,000 positions in photonic technologies, including both hourly and salaried employees. The second quarter reductions resulted in a restructuring charge of $8 million ($5 million after tax). 14 In the third quarter of 2001, additional actions were approved and undertaken, primarily in the Telecommunications Segment, which included the following: closure of three manufacturing facilities in the photonic technologies business, resulting in the elimination of approximately 800 positions, and elimination of approximately 2,900 positions worldwide in the optical fiber and cable business. This action included a voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations. As a result of these actions, Corning recorded a total charge of $339 million ($222 million after tax) which included a restructuring charge of $103 million and a charge to impair plant and equipment of $236 million in the third quarter. The restructuring charge included $6 million for net pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges. In response to the continued deteriorating business condition, management approved and recorded the following restructuring actions in the fourth quarter: closure or consolidation of several manufacturing locations as well as smaller businesses across all operating segments, discontinuation of its initiative in Corning Microarray Technology products, part of Cornings life sciences business, and further headcount reduction of approximately 4,000 positions across all businesses, research and staff organizations. This action also included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations. As a result of actions taken in the fourth quarter, Corning recorded a charge in the quarter of $614 million ($363 million after tax and minority interest) which included a restructuring charge of $308 million and a charge to impair plant and equipment of $306 million. The restructuring charge included $35 million for pension and postretirement termination benefits and $25 million for net pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges. The carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the expected separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from that asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment charges were determined based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset. A significant portion of the assets impaired was recently acquired, or built in connection with capacity expansions in anticipation of future demand. Most of the impaired facilities are currently available for sale, others will be demolished. The impaired equipment will be auctioned, sold, or disposed during 2002. The facilities closed in the year primarily relate to the photonics and optical fiber and cable businesses that Corning is not exiting. The operations being exited comprise the majority of the lighting business of the Advanced Materials Segment. This business is not material to Cornings revenues or financial results. In summary, Cornings restructuring actions totaled $961 million in pre tax charges for the year ended December 31, 2001, of which $95 million related to exit costs primarily for lease termination and contract cancellation charges. Approximately one third of this total charge is expected to be paid in cash. The total number of positions eliminated was approximately 12,000. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 10,100 of the 12,000 employees had been separated under the plans. Corning expects to realize savings of approximately $400 million annually beginning in 2002 as a result of these restructuring actions. The savings are expected to be realized primarily in cost of sales and also in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. 15 Non cash charges for employee related costs were $66 million with $35 million for pension and postretirement termination benefits and $31 million for net pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges. Curtailment charges were recorded primarily due to the decrease in expected future years of service. The following table illustrates the charges, activity and balances of the restructuring reserve as of December 31, 2001: (In millions, except headcounts) Non Net Cash Remaining Total Cash Payments Reserve at Charges Charges in 2001 December 31, 2001 Restructuring charges: Employee related costs $ 324 $ 66 $ 60 $ 198 Other charges 95 17 78 Total restructuring charges $ 419 $ 66 $ 77 $ 276 Impairment of long lived assets: Assets held for use $ 46 $ 46 Assets held for disposal 496 496 Total impairment charges $ 542 $ 542 Total restructuring actions $ 961 $ 608 $ 77 $ 276 After tax and minority interest $ 590 The following table illustrates the charge for restructuring actions as it relates to Cornings operating segments: Charges for restructuring actions Corporate Functions Telecom Advanced Information Including Total munications Materials Display Research Charges Charges for restructuring actions $ 640 $ 94 $ 36 $ 191 $ 961 The following table illustrates the headcount reduction amongst U.S. Hourly, U.S. Salaried and Non U.S. positions: Headcount reduction U.S. Hourly U.S. Salaried Non U.S. Total Headcount reduction 6,000 3,100 2,900 12,000 OPERATING SEGMENTS Corning groups its products into three operating segments: Telecommunications, Advanced Materials and Information Display. Corning also includes the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with Cornings operating segments in segment net income. Corning retroactively changed its definition of segment net income in the fourth quarter of 2001 to include the amortization of purchased intangibles. In addition during the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Corning realigned one product line from the Advanced Materials Segment into the Telecommunications Segment. Segment results for 2000 and 1999 have been restated for the changes and are presented below. Segment amounts exclude revenues, expenses and equity earnings not specifically identifiable to segments. Segment net income excludes impairment and amortization of goodwill, impairment of other intangible assets, restructuring actions, purchased IPRD charges, other one time acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring items. This measure is not in accordance with GAAP and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. 16 Corning prepared the financial results for its three operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which Corning management internally disaggregates financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. Corning has allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than it would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The nonrecurring items noted above are excluded from segment net income, but are described more fully in Non Segment Results. Telecommunications (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net sales $ 4,458 $ 5,186 $ 2,987 Research, development and engineering expenses $ 474 $ 395 $ 262 Interest expense $ 104 $ 70 $ 59 Segment (loss) earnings before minority interest and equity earnings $ (93) $ 692 $ 341 Minority interest in losses (earnings) of subsidiaries 3 (34) Equity in earnings of associated companies 12 1 15 Segment net (loss) income $ (81) $ 696 $ 322 Segment (loss) earnings before minority interest and equity earnings as a percentage of segment sales (2.1)% 13.3% 11.4% Segment net (loss) income as a percentage of segment sales (1.8)% 13.4% 10.8% The Telecommunications Segment produces optical fiber and cable, optical hardware and equipment, photonic modules and components and optical networking devices for the worldwide telecommunications industry. 2001 vs. 2000 Sales in the Telecommunications Segment decreased 14% from 2000 to $4.5 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the sales decline was 19%. The decrease in sales was primarily due to sales volume decreases in most businesses throughout the segment as capital spending in the telecommunications industry decreased significantly. Segment net income fell precipitously compared to 2000s strong results as net income in the optical fiber and cable business was more than offset by losses in all other businesses. The loss of sales volume in premium fiber and photonic products reduced gross margins and the segment incurred operating charges totaling $333 million ($221 million after tax) to write down excess and obsolete inventory, including estimated purchase commitments, further lowering gross margin percentages. Sales in the optical fiber and cable business in 2001 remained flat at $2.9 billion compared with 2000, although sales declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 4% compared to 2000. The lack of growth reflects the loss of volume in premium products beginning in the second quarter due to the decline in long haul demand as capital spending for network buildouts diminished and the business began to experience volume decreases in sales of single mode fiber in the third quarter. As a result, most fiber manufacturing facilities were idled in the fourth quarter. Overall, fiber and cable volume decreased approximately 15% for the year as a result of an increase of approximately 30% in the first half of the year offset by a decrease of approximately 50% in the second half. The weighted average price for Cornings optical fiber and cable products remained relatively stable compared to 2000 as higher prices were offset by significantly decreased volumes for premium products. Premium fiber as a percentage of total fiber demand was approximately 20% in 2001. Net income for the optical fiber and cable business decreased over 5% compared to 2000 as the loss of sales volume in premium products was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin single mode products. In response to reduced demand for fiber products, Corning announced it will permanently close its optical fiber operations in Deeside, North Wales and its cabling operations in Saskatoon, Canada in addition to temporarily ceasing production at smaller cabling facilities. Sales in the hardware and equipment business declined 20% in 2001 to $817 million compared to $1.02 billion in 2000. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 28% compared to 2000. The decrease was due to lower sales volumes as capital spending in the cable television industry fell significantly from prior year levels. Business performance decreased significantly to a small loss in 2001 due to considerably lower sales volumes. This business reduced its headcount during the year and closed a small manufacturing facility. 17 The photonic technologies business manufactures photonic modules and components primarily for the optical amplification market. Sales in the photonic technologies business declined over 50% to $462 million compared with $1.04 billion in 2000. The sales decrease reflects significant declines in orders from major customers caused by the decrease in capital spending in the telecommunications industry. The business incurred a significant operating loss for the year as a result of lower sales volumes, excess capacity, a higher fixed cost structure and charges for excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters. During the second quarter, major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and cancelled orders already placed. As a result, management determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their product life cycle. Corning recorded a charge to write down excess and obsolete inventory, including estimated purchase commitments, of $273 million ($184 million after tax) in cost of sales in the second quarter of 2001. The business recorded an additional charge of $60 million ($37 million after tax) in the fourth quarter as a result of lower revenue forecasts for 2002. Corning has, or is in the process of disposing all such inventory except approximately $100 million. Corning has retained and isolated this inventory, and in the unlikely event that product is sold, Corning will fully disclose the impact on its margins. Corning announced a downsizing of the photonic technologies business and closed the following three manufacturing facilities in 2001: Benton Park facility in Benton Township, PA, Corning Lasertrons facility in Nashua, NH, and Monroe Park manufacturing and development operations in Henrietta, NY. In addition, Corning scaled back its photonic technologies operations in Erwin Park, NY and the remainder of its photonic facilities to adjust its manufacturing capacity levels and headcount to lower revenue expectations. The business reduced its headcount approximately 75% from peak employment levels in 2001. The controls and connectors business manufactures control systems, switches and encoders. Sales in this business decreased 15% to $205 million in 2001 compared to $241 million in 2000. Lower sales volume was the primary reason for the decline due to the weak U.S. economy. The business incurred an insignificant loss for the year compared to an insignificant profit in 2000 due to the depressed volume. The optical networking business manufactures wavelength management products and optical switch modules. The business began shipping products to customers in the third quarter of 2000. Sales for 2001 were $38 million and comprised mostly of dynamic spectral equalizers, compared to partial year sales of $11 million in 2000. The loss in 2001 was greater than 2000 primarily due to the $28 million pre tax write down of an investment in intellectual property. In addition, volumes were lower than expected and development spending increased. Sales to Cornings largest customer in 2001 were under 10% of consolidated and Telecommunications Segment sales. 2000 vs. 1999 Sales in the Telecommunications Segment increased 74% over 1999 to $5.2 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales growth was 50%. The sales growth in the segment was led primarily by volume gains in the optical fiber and cable business, hardware and equipment and photonic technologies businesses. Segment net income more than doubled in 2000 compared to 1999. The percentage increase in segment net income exceeded the increase in sales, reflecting an overall increase in segment gross margin percentage and a decrease in research, development and engineering as a percentage of sales. Sales in the optical fiber and cable business in 2000 increased approximately 70% over 1999 to approximately $2.9 billion. The increase in sales resulted chiefly from the impact of acquisitions and strong volume gains for LEAF(R) optical fiber. Volume growth continued to be driven by regional, local and long haul telephone companies and cable television operators, including significant European carriers benefiting from continued deregulation of the telecommunications industry throughout Europe. Approximately $460 million of the increase in optical fiber and cable sales primarily resulted from the following acquisitions: the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Siecor GmbH and the cabling business previously owned by Siemens in the first quarter of 2000, and the acquisition of the optical cable business from BICC, plc and the remaining 50% interest in Optical Waveguides Australia, Pty. Ltd. in the second quarter of 1999. 18 Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, sales in the optical fiber and cable business increased 42% for the year principally due to sales volume gains of almost 50%, reflecting continued strong demand for Cornings premium fiber products. Volume of premium fiber and cable products, including Cornings LEAF optical fiber, more than doubled over the same period in 1999. Price declines ranged between 5% and 10% for Cornings optical fiber and cable products in comparison with last year. The weighted average optical fiber and cable price in 2000 remained relatively stable compared to 1999. The rate of price declines for cabled products slowed throughout 2000 commensurate with the worldwide tightening of optical fiber supply. Net income from the optical fiber and cable business increased approximately 84% in 2000 compared to 1999. The strong earnings performance is due to volume growth in high data rate products, relatively stable pricing and a shift to a higher premium product mix. Sales in the telecommunications hardware and equipment business increased over 82% in 2000 to approximately $1.02 billion. This increase resulted from a higher sales volume of existing products, the Siemens transaction and particularly strong demand from cable television customers, offset in part by price declines. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales increased 57% over 1999. Overall net income almost doubled over 1999 largely due to sales volume increases. Sales in the photonic technologies business more than doubled over 1999 to approximately $1.0 billion. The business realized strong sales volume gains in 2000 led by new product sales, growth in amplifier sales and acquisitions. The operating performance in this business improved in 2000 as the business became solidly profitable due to strong volume, productivity gains and more cost efficient access to pump lasers achieved through the acquisition of Lasertron. Corning continued to invest heavily in research and development in this business. Sales in the controls and connectors business increased 14% in 2000 to $241 million. Net income from this business improved slightly, moving from breakeven in 1999 to modest profitability in 2000, primarily due to sales volume increases. During the third quarter of 2000, the optical networking business began shipments of its wavelength management products to customers. Sales for 2000 were $11 million. This business operated at a loss due to significant research and development investments. Sales to Cornings largest customer accounted for approximately 12% of the Telecommunications Segment sales in 2000, including a significant portion of total sales in the photonic technologies business, but under 10% of consolidated sales. Outlook: Management believes the weak conditions in the telecommunications industry experienced in the second part of 2001 will continue into 2002. First quarter sales are expected to approximate fourth quarter 2001 levels; however, losses are expected to decrease somewhat due to restructuring actions taken and the absence of nonrecurring charges. Management does not expect a recovery in this industry until late 2002, or early 2003. Corning anticipates that recovery in this segment is dependent on capital spending by network operators and cable television entities as they add fiber to metro access networks in the U.S., and on the level of demand in international markets. As the industry currently has significant excess capacity, price pressure is expected to continue throughout 2002. Advanced Materials (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net sales $ 993 $ 1,021 $ 1,025 Research, development and engineering expenses $ 120 $ 116 $ 93 Interest expense $ 25 $ 18 $ 23 Segment earnings before equity earnings $ 19 $ 58 $ 76 Equity in earnings of associated companies 27 22 21 Segment net income $ 46 $ 80 $ 97 Segment earnings before equity earnings as a percentage of segment sales 1.9% 5.7% 7.4% Segment net income as a percentage of segment sales 4.6% 7.8% 9.5% The Advanced Materials Segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass, glass ceramic and polymer technologies. 19 2001 vs. 2000 Sales in 2001 for the Advanced Materials Segment decreased 3% to $993 million compared to sales of $1.02 billion in 2000. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 5%. Sales increases in the life sciences business were more than offset by declines in the environmental technologies and semiconductor materials businesses. Segment net income also declined in 2001 as the segment recorded net income of $46 million compared to $80 million in 2000 for a 43% decrease. The decline in profitability was primarily due to weaker performance by the environmental technologies and semiconductor materials businesses partially offset by improved performance by the life sciences business. Sales in the environmental technologies business, the largest business in the segment and a manufacturer of catalytic converter substrates, decreased 8% in 2001 to $379 million. The business experienced lower sales volumes compared to 2000 due to decreased vehicle production. Volume growth in Asia was more than offset by declining volumes in North America and Europe. Earnings for the year were down almost 50% primarily due to lower sales volumes, manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new ultra thin wall products, excess capacity and start up costs in South Africa and China. In October 2001, Corning announced the approval of a new diesel emission control product manufacturing facility. The new plant will be located in Erwin, NY with construction to begin in 2002. Initial production of substrate and filter products is expected in early 2004. Sales in the life sciences business, a supplier of advanced microplates and other laboratory products, increased 8% over 2000 to $267 million. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in sales volume. Earnings in the base business almost doubled over 2000 primarily due to a shift to higher margin products in sales mix along with improvements in manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall earnings in the business were diluted due to the investment in microarray technology which Corning discontinued at the end of 2001. Sales in Cornings other Advanced Materials businesses, including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products, decreased 4% in 2001 to $347 million. Excluding the acquisition of Tropel in March 2001, sales decreased 11%. The decrease was due to softness in the market for ophthalmic products and high purity fused silica. Earnings for the year were approximately breakeven and down slightly compared to 2000. Lower sales volumes and production slowdowns were partially offset by a marginal increase in equity earnings from Eurokera, a French based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops, resulting in comparable earnings between years. Corning plans to exit the lighting and tubing businesses in 2002, and has announced the shutdown of manufacturing facilities in Greenville, OH and Corning, NY. 2000 vs. 1999 Sales in the Advanced Materials Segment were relatively flat compared to 1999 at approximately $1.0 billion, chiefly due to growth in the environmental technologies business, which was offset by a sales decline due to the divestiture of the Quanterra business in January 2000 and flat performance in other Advanced Materials businesses. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, sales improved 6%. Segment net income declined 17% in 2000 as earnings improvements in other Advanced Materials businesses were more than offset by decreased performance in environmental technologies and life sciences while equity earnings remained flat. Sales in the environmental technologies business increased almost 3% over 1999 to $411 million. The growth in sales resulted from a strong global auto market in 2000 and increased market penetration of Cornings thin wall products coupled with increases in the base substrate business that was partially offset by the weak Euro. Earnings in this business decreased approximately 12%, principally due to start up costs of new plants in South Africa and China and elevated research and development spending on diesel substrate programs. Sales in the life sciences business of $248 million were down over 6% in comparison to 1999 as the business continued to see a shift in spending in the pharmaceutical industry from traditional products to genomics. The business reported a small loss in 2000 compared to a modest profit in 1999. The loss was primarily due to an increased commitment to research and development and marketing costs associated with the launch of Cornings microarray technology products in the third quarter of 2000. Excluding start up costs related to microarrays, earnings were flat compared to 1999. 20 Sales in Cornings other Advanced Materials businesses were relatively flat, compared to 1999, at approximately $362 million. The flat performance was due to elevated sales of high purity fused silica products in the semiconductor materials business, which was offset by the impact of the divestiture of Quanterra in January. Excluding the divestiture of Quanterra, sales improved over 23%. Earnings from these businesses more than doubled over 1999 due largely to increased volume and despite flat performances from Eurokera and Keraglass, a French based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops. Outlook: The environmental technologies businesses experienced slow sales at the end of 2001 and that trend is expected to continue into 2002. Sales growth in environmental technologies will be dependent upon an overall economic recovery in the U.S., as well as Europe, evidenced by increased vehicle production. The life sciences business is expected to continue its 2001 growth trends in 2002. The other businesses in this segment experienced sales declines over the latter half of the year and that trend is expected to continue into 2002. Growth in other advanced materials businesses will depend on recovery in the semiconductor materials business and the general economy. Information Display (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net sales $ 800 $ 894 $ 701 Research, development and engineering expenses $ 40 $ 29 $ 23 Interest expense $ 23 $ 19 $ 11 Segment earnings before minority interest and equity earnings $ 44 $ 114 $ 58 Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries (27) (23) Equity in earnings of associated companies 105 145 68 Segment net income $ 149 $ 232 $ 103 Segment earnings before minority interest and equity earnings as a percentage of segment sales 5.5% 12.8% 8.3% Segment net income as a percentage of segment sales 18.6% 26.0% 14.7% The Information Display Segment manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays (display technologies), glass panels and funnels for televisions and cathode ray tubes (conventional video components), and precision lens assemblies for projection video systems. 2001 vs. 2000 Sales in the Information Display Segment decreased 11% in 2001 to $800 million as sales decreases in the conventional video components and display technologies businesses more than offset an increase in the precision lens business. Segment net income declined 36% with each business deteriorating compared to 2000. Sales in the display technology business, a leading supplier of ultra thin glass substrates used to produce flat panel display, decreased 3% to $323 million in 2001. A significant shift in customer demand from Japan to Korea caused volume to increase approximately 35% at Samsung Corning Precision Glass Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision), an equity affiliate and Korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass, and 17% in the consolidated business. This volume growth, when offset by the impact of price declines and the deterioration of the yen resulted in the sales decline of 3%. Earnings for 2001 decreased approximately 25%, primarily due to lower operating margins driven by pricing pressures, start up costs incurred for the May opening of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan and additional development and engineering expenses for Eagle2000(TM), a new glass substrate used in active matrix liquid crystal displays. Additionally, equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision were down over 15% compared to 2000 primarily due to Corning having a smaller ownership interest in the company in 2001 vs. 2000. Sales in the conventional video components business, a manufacturer of optically pure, mechanically precise face plates and funnels for larger screen television tubes, were $252 million, down 29% compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a weak U.S. economy and increased competitive pricing pressure. Earnings were down almost 50% due to lower sales volumes, decreased margins, a production slowdown in the fourth quarter and lower equity earnings. Samsung Corning Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning), a manufacturer based in South Korea that produces glass panels and funnels for television and display monitors, also experienced lower sales volumes and increased competitive pricing pressure, and thus lower earnings. Corning owns 50% of Samsung Corning and accounts for this investment under the equity method. 21 Sales in the precision lens business, a manufacturer of lens systems for projection video and a specialist at making lenses from optical plastics, increased 9% to $225 million in 2001. The increase was due to the growth of digital projection television in the U.S. and China where the demand for high definition television was growing. Despite the increase in sales, earnings for 2001 decreased approximately 30% primarily due to increased research and development spending and manufacturing costs related to capacity expansion of projection television assemblies. 2000 vs. 1999 Sales in the Information Display Segment increased 28% in 2000 to $894 million, primarily due to strong growth in the display technologies and precision lens businesses. Segment net income more than doubled, as did equity earnings, reflecting increased earnings in each business over 1999. Sales in the conventional video components business remained relatively flat at $354 million for 2000, compared to 1999, due to slightly lower volumes offset in part by price increases as the supply of television glass began to tighten. Earnings in this business increased 83% compared to 1999, primarily due to higher equity earnings, in addition to cost reductions and the impact of volume and mix as a shift to higher premium products occurred in 2000. The increase in equity earnings reflected improved volume and stable pricing at Samsung Corning. Sales in the display technologies business in 2000 increased 76% over 1999 to $333 million. This significant increase was the result of continued strong demand for the business liquid crystal glass for flat panel displays, led by increased penetration into the desktop display market. Earnings in this business more than doubled compared to 1999, reflecting strong volume gains and stable pricing. Also equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision more than doubled largely due to strong volume gains in the Korean marketplace. Sales in the precision lens business increased 32% in 2000 to $207 million as a result of strong volume growth for projection televisions driven by demand for larger size digital television sets in the entertainment market sector. Earnings in this business increased 59% over 1999 primarily due to volume gains, manufacturing efficiencies and the refocusing of product lines. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Samsung Corning recognized a nonoperating gain of $23 million from the divestment of its 40% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. Cornings $11 million share of this gain is excluded from segment equity earnings. Outlook: Management expects the display technologies business to see growth in sales volume in 2002, primarily due to increased penetration of flat panel monitors. This business will continue to be impacted by its exposure to the exchange rate of the yen. Management expects the soft economy to continue to impact the conventional video components business in 2002 as low demand and overcapacity of glass exert downward pressure on prices. In addition, changes in the competitive environment in the conventional television glass market may present significant challenges to this business. The projection lens business anticipates modest growth that will be dependent on global economic recovery. NON SEGMENT RESULTS Cornings non segment results include the operations of Steuben, a crystal glass manufacturer, and equity earnings from small nonstrategic investments that are not aligned with Cornings three operating segments. In addition, the results of operating segments does not include impairment and amortization of goodwill, impairment of purchased intangibles, restructuring actions, purchased IPRD charges, other one time acquisition related charges and other nonrecurring charges. Amortization of goodwill Amortization of goodwill totaled $363 million ($344 million after tax) in 2001 compared to $216 million ($202 million after tax) in 2000 and $24 million ($18 million after tax) in 1999. Amortization of goodwill increased in 2001 as it included charges for the entire year related to transactions completed late in 2000. The amortization of goodwill was reduced by the impairment of goodwill charge taken in the second quarter of 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, Corning adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Business Combinations, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill. The new standard is discussed further under New Accounting Standards and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Nonrecurring non segment results for 2001 are discussed earlier in Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Restructuring Actions. Nonrecurring items in 2000 and 1999 are described below. Other restructuring and impairment charges In the first quarter of 2000, Corning discontinued recognition of equity earnings from Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) and recorded a charge to impair its investment for $36 million due to PCCs decision to file for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 for asbestos litigation. See Legal Proceedings and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. In the third quarter of 1999, Corning recognized an impairment charge of $15 million ($10 million after tax) in connection with managements decision to sell Quanterra Incorporated. In the fourth quarter of 1999, Corning released restructuring reserves totaling $14 million ($9 million after tax) related to early retirement incentives offered in 1998 after determining the total cost of the incentive package would be less than anticipated. Nonoperating gains In 2000, Samsung Corning recorded a fourth quarter nonoperating gain of $23 million from the divestment of its 40% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. Cornings $11 million share of this gain is included in equity in earnings of associated companies. In 2000, Corning recorded a first quarter nonoperating gain of $7 million ($4 million after tax) on the sale of Quanterra Incorporated to Severn Trent Laboratories for approximately $35 million. In 1999, Corning recorded a third quarter nonoperating gain of $30 million ($9 million after tax and minority interest) as a result of the sale by Siecor Corporation of Republic Wire and Cable for approximately $52 million in cash and short term notes. Acquisition related expenses In the fourth quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a non tax deductible IPRD charge of $323 million related to the Pirelli transaction. In the second quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a non tax deductible IPRD charge of $51 million related to the acquisitions of IntelliSense Corporation ($7 million) and NZ Applied Technologies (NZAT) ($44 million). In the first quarter of 2000, Corning recorded an IPRD charge of $42 million ($25 million after tax) related to the acquisition of British Telecommunications Photonics Technology Research Center (PTRC). In the first quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a charge for acquisition costs related to the merger of Oak Industries, Inc. of $47 million ($43 million after tax) primarily comprised of legal and investment banking fees. Charges for purchased IPRD are described in more detail under In Process Research and Development. INCOME TAXES Cornings effective (benefit) tax rate for continuing operations was (7.4%), 58.9% and 30.7% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three years are not comparable, primarily due to the significant amounts of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2001 and 2000, along with significant charges for impairment of goodwill in 2001 and IPRD in 2000, as these charges are not tax deductible. These items reduce the benefit in 2001 and increase the expense in 2000. Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements reconciles the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate. 23 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Corning is meeting its funding needs through operating cash flows, outside borrowings and equity issuances. At December 31, 2001, Corning had $2.2 billion in cash and short term investments and an unused revolving credit facility of $2.0 billion. Cash Flows and Working Capital Sources of cash flow in 2001 were primarily operations, generating cash of $1.4 billion and financing transactions (primarily issuances of public debt and equity securities) providing cash of $0.9 billion. Corning used cash of $2.4 billion in investing activities, primarily for capital expenditures and the purchase of short term investments. Cash provided by operations in 2001 was comparable with 2000 results, despite the decrease in net income due to the magnitude of non cash charges, increased depreciation and second half reduction in working capital as sales declined. Corning expects cash from operations in 2002 to be significantly less than 2001, primarily due to lower operating earnings and restructuring payments. If sales improve from fourth quarter 2001 levels, Corning expects to use cash as working capital increases commensurate with higher demand. Cash and short term investments on hand at December 31, 2001, access to commercial paper markets and the revolving credit facility are alternative sources of liquidity. These vehicles are discussed separately below. Corning has invested significant cash in capital expansions in the last three years. During 2001, Corning reduced its capital spending program from its original plan of $2.5 billion to conserve cash. Capital spending totaled $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion, including $0.2 billion in accrued capital expenditures, and $757 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The high level of capital spending since 1999 relates primarily to capacity expansions in Cornings Telecommunications Segment and expanded research and development facilities. Cornings 2002 capital spending program is expected to be less than $500 million as all expansion related programs in the Telecommunications Segment are being delayed indefinitely. Expansions in 2002 are expected to be primarily in the liquid crystal display and environmental businesses. Cornings net investment in short term instruments during 2001 was $467 million, compared to its initial net investment of $715 million in 2000. In 2000, Corning began investing its excess cash in highly liquid debt securities such as asset backed securities, municipal and corporate bonds and U.S. treasury notes. These investments are on deposit with a major financial institution. Corning raised approximately $225 million in August 2001 through the issuance of 14.2 million shares of common stock. The proceeds are expected to finance the acquisition of Lucent Technologies controlling equity interests in Shanghai Fiber Optic Co., Ltd. and Beijing Fiber Optic Cable Co., Ltd. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2002. In addition, in November 2001 Corning completed a convertible debt offering of $665 million, due November 1, 2008. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. Corning intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes. Dividends paid to common shareholders in 2001 totaled $112 million compared with $210 million in 2000 and $176 million in 1999. On July 9, 2001, Corning announced the discontinuation of the payment of dividends on its common stock. Cornings working capital decreased from $2.7 billion at the end of 2000 to $2.1 billion at the end of 2001. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.1 at the end of 2001, compared to 2.4 at the end of 2000. Cornings working capital in 2001 and 2000 included large cash and short term investment balances. Excluding cash and short term investments, Cornings working capital for 2001 was $(106) million, or a decrease of $997 million, compared to $891 million in 2000. The decrease in non cash components of working capital was primarily due to lower inventories and a significant decrease in accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding in trade receivables decreased to 54 days for the fourth quarter of 2001, from 56 days for the fourth quarter of 2000. As of December 31, 2001, Corning had not provided vendor financing to any of its customers. Cornings long term debt as a percentage of total capital increased from 27% at year end 2000 to 45% at the end of 2001. The increase is primarily due to the reduction in shareholders equity arising from losses recorded in 2001 and the issuance of convertible debt in November 2001. Financing Matters and Credit Ratings Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2001, totaled $233 million with a weighted average maturity of 23 days. Cornings commercial paper program is supported by the $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with 18 banks, expiring on August 17, 2005. As of December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under the facility. The facility includes a covenant requiring Corning to maintain a total debt to capital ratio, as defined, not greater than 60%. At December 31, 2001, this ratio was 47%. 24 Cornings credit ratings as of March 1, 2002 were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Rating Last Update Long Term Debt Commercial Paper Standard & Poors (a) BBB A 2 November 6, 2001 Moodys (a) Baa1 P 2 November 7, 2001 Fitch (a) BBB F 3 February 4, 2002 (a) All three credit rating agencies have maintained a negative outlook which means a rating may be lowered. Should business performance decline from the levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2001, these ratings could receive further review for possible downgrade. A downgrade in short term ratings could result in a significantly reduced ability to access the commercial paper market and higher borrowing costs. Cornings debt agreements do not include covenants that accelerate the maturity of borrowings as a result of changes in credit ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In March 2001, Corning filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that became effective in the first quarter. The shelf permits the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of various debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2001, Cornings remaining capacity under its shelf registration was approximately $4.1 billion. Cornings 2001 earnings were not adequate to cover its fixed charges (principally interest and related charges on debt), primarily as a result of losses incurred in Cornings Telecommunications Segment and the impairment of goodwill. Cornings earnings may not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in 2002. Management believes that Corning has ample liquidity, retains satisfactory access to the capital markets and maintains unused, revolving credit facilities. Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies At December 31, 2001, the contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies of Corning were as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations 2006 and 2002 2003 2004 2005 thereafter Total (In millions) Long term debt $ 244 $ 173 $ 38 $ 2,411 $ 2,003 $ 4,869 Minimum rental commitments 67 61 57 51 331 567 Business combinations 225 225 Total contractual cash obligations $ 536 $ 234 $ 95 $ 2,462 $ 2,334 $ 5,661 At December 31, 2001, future minimum lease payments to be received under a noncancelable sublease to Quest Diagnostics totaled $47 million. Quest Diagnostics, in turn, has a noncancelable sublease covering approximately $31 million of the minimum lease payments due to Corning. Corning has agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics should Quest Diagnostics sublessee default on the minimum lease payments. Additionally, Corning continues to guarantee certain obligations of Quest Diagnostics totaling $14 million. 25 Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 5 years and Total 1 year years years years thereafter (In millions) Performance bonds and guarantees $ 241 $ 241 Contingent purchase price for acquisitions 238 $ 25 $ 25 188 Dow Corning credit facility 150 150 Stand by letters of credit 33 33 Loan guarantees 16 12 4 Total other commercial commitments and contingencies $ 678 $ 70 $ 29 $ 579 At December 31, 2001, Corning had guaranteed debt of equity affiliates totaling $16 million. In addition, Corning and certain of its subsidiaries have provided other financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones, stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. Corning has agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the Bankruptcy Plan as described in Note 9. Management believes the significant majority of the other guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. IN PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Corning completed a number of purchase acquisitions in 2000. As part of analyzing each of these acquisitions, Corning made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally. Corning based this decision on a number of factors, including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market. Corning also considered its internal research resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology, if any. Corning expects to use the same decision process in the future. In connection with the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method, management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses resulting from such acquisitions. Amounts allocated to purchased IPRD were established through recognized valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry. Certain projects were acquired for which technological feasibility had not been established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative future uses existed. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, "Accounting for Research and Development Costs," as interpreted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method," amounts assigned to IPRD meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the purchase. The value allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was determined by the traditional income approach, which discounts expected future debt free income to present value. The discount rates used were specific to each project and were derived from a cost of capital for each specific acquisition target, adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project. Expected future debt free income was derived with the following considerations: revenues were estimated based on relevant market size, growth trends in the industry and individual product sales cycles, estimated operating expenses included cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses to maintain the products once they have been introduced, estimated tax expenses were specific to each acquired entity and its tax profile, and for certain projects, as appropriate, a return on core technology was deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a return on assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons. 26 The nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning, designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations. Corning expects that products incorporating the acquired technology from these projects will be completed and will begin to generate cash flows over the five years following integration. Management expects to continue supporting the majority of these research and development efforts. Projects abandoned are noted below. This support is not expected to change Cornings research and development expense trends. However, the timing and success of development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products and significant competition in the marketplace. The following is a more detailed discussion of the valuations associated with acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded: Acquisition of Pirellis Optical Components and Devices Business On December 12, 2000, Corning completed the Pirelli transaction. This business had a significant number of research and development projects ongoing at the time of acquisition of which 12 were valued as IPRD projects. Projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of 17% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for this entity. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. Corning recorded a non tax deductible IPRD charge of $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Costs to complete the in process research programs are expected to approximate $25 million to $30 million. These projects have been categorized into four product technologies as follows: Lithium Niobate Modulators The business is developing a number of different lithium niobate modulators. Lithium niobate modulators are ideally suited for use in high speed, long haul optical communications networks. The technology has been chosen by a majority of long haul equipment suppliers because it has the best combination of optical, electronic and reliability performance. Five of the research projects qualified as IPRD projects, and the completion percentages of these five projects ranged from 10% 90%. A non tax deductible charge of $235 million was recognized and the value of individual modulator projects in process ranged from $19 million to $83 million. Submarine Products The business had planned to develop high reliability 980 nanometer (nm) pump laser chips and modules for submarine use. These devices are components within an optical amplifier. At the acquisition date, two IPRD projects with completion percentages of 10% and 50% were valued. A non tax deductible charge of $26 million resulted from 980 nm pump laser submarine projects in process. Individual research values were $3 million and $23 million. As part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on July 9, 2001, Corning abandoned this project. This action did not have a material impact on cash flow, or the results of operations. Gratings At the date of acquisition, three qualifying gratings programs with completion percentages ranging from 20% 85% were valued. A non tax deductible IPRD charge of $16 million resulted from gratings programs. Individual in process projects were valued between $2 million and $11 million. As part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on July 9, 2001, Corning abandoned this project. This action did not have a material impact on cash flow, or the results of operations. Specialty Fiber Two specialty fiber programs at the business met the definition of IPRD. Specialty fibers are used in conjunction with several other components to make an erbium doped fiber amplifier, which boosts the strength of the optical signal. At the acquisition date, these projects were 40% and 60% complete. A non tax deductible IPRD charge of $46 million resulted from specialty fiber programs, with the largest program being valued at $42 million. 27 IntelliSense On June 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of IntelliSense, a manufacturer and developer of micro electro mechanical systems (MEMs), or small electro mechanical, micro fabricated devices. MEMs technology, when integrated with optics and packaging expertise, enables the development of optical add drop switches and optical cross connects, that are expected to play a key role in the development and build out of the optical networking layer. As of the acquisition date, IntelliSense had three qualifying research projects underway. These research and development projects are anticipated to result primarily in the development of new telecommunications products. Projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of 20% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for IntelliSense. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 10% 90%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $20 million. Corning recorded a $7 million IPRD charge in the second quarter of 2000. No project valued exceeded $5 million. If none of the projects are successfully completed, Corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets. Failure of any single project would not materially impact Cornings financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In all material respects, the research projects have progressed as planned at acquisition. NZ Applied Technologies On May 5, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of NZAT. NZAT was developing a line of high speed, solid state components for dense wavelength division multiplexing systems, such as variable optical attenuators, that will meet industry demands for speed and quality. Of these projects, four were determined to meet the criteria for purchased IPRD as of the acquisition date. Projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of 21% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for NZAT. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 10% 80%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $10 million. A $44 million non tax deductible IPRD charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from $1 million to $29 million. If none of the projects are successfully completed, Corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets. Failure of any single project would not materially impact Cornings financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2000, NZAT completed certain product development milestones for its variable optical attenuator products. Photonics Technology Research Center On February 14, 2000, Corning acquired PTRC. Located in Suffolk, UK, the PTRC had extensive research and development efforts underway at the acquisition date including work on planar integrated optics, semiconductor optical amplifiers, electro absorption modulators and optical networking devices. Seven projects were determined to meet the criteria for purchased IPRD. Projected debt free income was determined for each of the projects and initially discounted using a rate of 35% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for PTRC. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 50% 80%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $40 million. A $42 million ($25 million after tax) IPRD charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from less than $1 million to $16 million. If none of the projects are successfully completed, Corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets. Failure of any single project would not materially impact Cornings financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. ENVIRONMENT Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 12 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. Corning has accrued approximately $24 million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at December 31, 2001. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of Cornings estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. 28 MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES Corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Cornings exposure to exchange rate effects includes: exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact Cornings net equity. Cornings most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Western European countries. Corning selectively enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 12 months or less to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on Cornings operating results. Corning also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where its foreign subsidiaries or Corning Incorporated enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Corning does not hold or issue any derivative contracts that hedge its foreign currency denominated net asset exposures. Corning does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Equity in earnings of associated companies has historically represented a significant amount of Cornings income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies was $148 million in 2001 with foreign based affiliates comprising 93% of this amount. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies. Corning uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2001, Corning and its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts, open option contracts, foreign denominated debt and foreign cash and cash equivalent holdings with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2001. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $83 million. The nature of Cornings foreign exchange rate risk exposures have not changed materially from December 31, 2000, however Cornings acquisition activity in 2000 has expanded its presence in international markets and thus increased the degree of its exposures overall. In 2000, Corning began investing in start up companies with emerging technologies in the telecommunications industry. These investments are recorded at cost and contain a high degree of risk as the technologies under development may never yield marketable products. Investments of this nature totaled $133 million and $52 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Corning routinely assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of these investments and will impair these assets when a decline in value is other than temporary. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described below. The critical judgments impacting the financial statements include: the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventory write down and realizability determinations, salvage values of assets impaired in connection with restructuring actions, valuation allowances for deferred income taxes, and purchased IPRD. 29 In each situation, management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters, or future events that are inherently uncertain. Specifically, in its assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, management made estimates of the fair values based upon forecasted revenues and operations. (Refer to Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion of managements determination of its impairment charge.) An assessment of inventory realizability requires management to forecast sales and future technological developments. An estimation of salvage values associated with assets to be disposed of requires judgments concerning such factors as fluctuating real estate markets and timing of disposal. Corning has reduced its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. In so doing, Corning has estimated future taxable income in determining the valuation allowance. Valuing purchased IPRD requires management to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows resulting from new product introductions. Corning used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and where applicable, established valuation techniques in making its estimates. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Among other provisions, all future business combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited for transactions initiated after June 30, 2001. In addition, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually. SFAS No. 142 was effective for Corning on January 1, 2002. An assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption must be performed within one year. At December 31, 2001, goodwill approximated $1.9 billion. Corning does not anticipate a transitional impairment charge from the adoption of the standard. The following table presents a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share to adjusted net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share, as if SFAS No. 142 had been in effect as follows: Years ended December 31, (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Reported net (loss) income $ (5,498) $ 422 $ 516 Goodwill amortization, net of income taxes 345 203 18 Adjusted net (loss) income $ (5,153) $ 625 $ 534 Reported net (loss) income per share basic $ (5.89) $ 0.49 $ 0.67 Goodwill amortization, net of income taxes 0.37 0.24 0.03 Adjusted net (loss) income per share basic $ (5.52) $ 0.73 $ 0.70 Reported net (loss) income per share diluted $ (5.89) $ 0.48 $ 0.66 Goodwill amortization, net of income taxes 0.37 0.23 0.02 Adjusted net (loss) income per share diluted $ (5.52) $ 0.71 $ 0.68 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Corning is required to implement SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This standard supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. Corning is required to implement SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. Corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 30 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the SEC on Forms 10 Q and 8 K and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different.
