Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The financial data related to the precision lens business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2002 is reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Results of Discontinued Operations below. Overview During 2002 Corning continued the restructuring efforts that began in the second quarter of 2001. The telecommunications industry continued to decline over the course of the year as the trends exhibited in 2001 such as softness in demand, excess capacity, increased intensity of competition and growing pressure on price and profits have persisted. Major carriers have reduced capital spending for a variety of reasons, some of which include network over capacity, bankruptcy of key telecommunications customers and suppliers and the overall economic uncertainties in the world economy. The significant lack of capital spending by these carriers resulted in drastically reduced sales volumes for Corning in 2002. As a result, Corning continued to see revenues decline in its Telecommunications Segment and thus incurred significant losses again in 2002. These current business conditions caused Corning to revise future expectations for its Telecommunications Segment which resulted in the recognition of the following fourth quarter charges in 2002: .. a pre tax charge of $400 million ($294 million after tax) to impair a portion of the goodwill in its Telecommunications Segment, and .. a pre tax charge of $269 million ($195 million after tax) to impair tangible and intangible assets in its photonic technologies business. In addition, Corning recorded the following fourth quarter charges in 2002: .. a pre tax charge of $140 million ($44 million after tax and minority interest) to impair tangible assets in its conventional video components business due to the maturation of the conventional television market in North America, and .. a pre tax charge of $652 million ($516 million after tax) for restructuring actions, primarily in the Telecommunications Segment that resulted in recording a total of $1.3 billion of restructuring and impairment charges for the full year. Corning took the following actions to compensate for a decrease in cash from operations and preserve liquidity: .. in December 2002, Corning completed the sale of its precision lens business for approximately $850 million and recorded a gain of $652 million ($415 million after tax), .. in July 2002, Corning issued 5.75 million shares of 7% Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock which generated net proceeds of $440 million and declared a one time dividend of $117 million on the offering, and .. from time to time throughout the year, Corning retired zero coupon convertible debentures with an accreted value of $493 million for cash of $308 million and recorded total gains of $176 million ($108 million after tax). Corning also spent a total of $490 million to repay its commercial paper borrowings and a portion of other long term debt. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Selected highlights from Cornings continuing operations were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages): 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 3,164 $ 6,047 $ 6,920 Gross margin $ 602 $ 1,820 $ 2,911 (gross margin %) 19% 30% 42% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 716 $ 1,090 $ 1,041 (as a % of revenues) 23% 18% 15% Research, development and engineering expenses $ 483 $ 622 $ 531 (as a % of revenues) 15% 10% 8% Amortization of goodwill $ 363 $ 216 (as a % of revenues) 6% 3% Operating (loss) income $(2,720) $(6,048) $ 631 (as a % of revenues) (86)% (100)% 9% (Loss) income from continuing operations $(1,780) $(5,532) $ 363 (as a % of revenues) (56)% (91)% 5% Net sales Consolidated net sales for 2002 were $3.2 billion, a decrease of 48%, or $2.9 billion, from 2001 sales of $6.1 billion. The sales decline was most pronounced in the Telecommunications Segment where significantly lower demand and price declines for Cornings optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies products drove a sales decline in that segment of 63%, or $2.8 billion year to year. Sales in the Technologies Segment for 2002 decreased 4%, or $55 million, compared to 2001. Consolidated net sales for 2001 decreased 13%, or $873 million from 2000 net sales of $6.9 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Cornings consolidated sales in 2001 decreased 17%, compared to 2000. Sales declines for 2001 occurred in both operating segments, but were most pronounced in the Telecommunications Segment where sales fell 14%. Gross margin As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased from 30% to 19% in 2002. Gross margin continued to be impacted by lower sales volumes in the Telecommunications Segment where the lower volumes were insufficient to cover the fixed manufacturing costs. Downward pricing pressure also continued to negatively impact gross margins, primarily in the optical fiber and cable business. These negative trends were offset by significant fixed cost reductions as manufacturing capacity was shut down. Gross margin in the Technologies Segment decreased approximately 2 points from 2001. In 2001, gross margin decreased to 30% from 42% in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to the loss of sales volume in premium fiber and photonics products and a total of $333 million of charges for the write down of inventory in the photonic technologies business over the second and fourth quarters of 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 34% to $716 million in 2002 while SG&A increased 5 points as a percentage of net sales to 23% over 2001. The decrease in SG&A for the year reflected the cost savings which resulted from the restructuring actions which began in 2001, while the increase as a percentage of net sales indicated the decline in revenues continued to outpace the cost benefit of restructuring actions. Management expects SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline in 2003 as a result of 2002 restructuring actions. SG&A increased 5% in 2001 over 2000 to $1,090 million, while SG&A as a percentage of net sales also increased 3 points over 2000. The increase was primarily due to a $90 million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of Corning common stock held by employees partially offset by the benefits of cost reduction activities. The Compensation Committee removed the restrictions on approximately 4.8 million shares, primarily because they were no longer effective as a retention tool due to the sharp reduction in share price from their grant date. Research, development and engineering Research, development and engineering expenses (RD&E) totaled $483 million for 2002, which represented a decline of 22%, compared to 2001. As a percentage of net sales, RD&E increased 5 points from 2001. The decrease in expense for the year reflected the impact of the restructuring actions, while the increase as a percentage of net sales was caused by the decline in revenues. Management expects to continue to invest in RD&E in 2003, but expects RD&E to decline to 10% of sales. In 2001, RD&E increased 17% to $622 million from 2000, while RD&E as a percentage of net sales increased 2 points over 2000. The increase as a percentage of sales was due to higher spending and lower revenues in 2001, compared to 2000. Amortization of Goodwill Effective January 1, 2002, Corning adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. The new standard is discussed further under New Accounting Standards and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of goodwill totaled $363 million ($344 million after tax) in 2001, compared to $216 million ($202 million after tax) in 2000. Amortization of goodwill increased in 2001 as it included charges for the entire year related to transactions completed late in 2000. The amortization of goodwill was reduced by the impairment of goodwill charge taken in the second quarter of 2001. Operating (loss) income Corning incurred a significant operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2002. The loss was primarily due to restructuring charges and goodwill and asset impairments totaling $2.1 billion. Further discussion of these charges begins under Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges. The 2001 operating loss of $6.0 billion is largely attributable to a charge of approximately $4.8 billion ($4.7 billion after tax) in the second quarter to impair goodwill and certain other intangible assets of the photonic technologies business. Cornings results for 2001 were also impacted by charges for restructuring actions of $953 million, which included charges for headcount reductions, exit costs and impairment of plant and equipment, an operating charge of $333 million to write down excess and obsolete inventory, a $90 million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of Corning common stock and a $28 million charge to write down an investment in intellectual property. Cornings 2000 results included purchased in process research and development (IPRD) charges of $416 million and other acquisition related charges of $47 million. Gain on Repurchases and Retirement of Debt Corning repurchased and retired zero coupon convertible debentures with an accreted value of $493 million in exchange for cash of $308 million resulting in gains of $176 million ($108 million after tax) on these transactions for the year ended December 31, 2002. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Income taxes Cornings (benefit) provision for income taxes and the related effective (benefit) income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ (726) $ (468) $ 383 Effective (benefit) income tax rate (26.7)% (7.6)% 61.7% The effective benefit rate in 2002 was impacted by restructuring, impairment and other charges and the gain on repurchases of debt. The effective benefit rate without consideration of these items was 30% for 2002. The effective income tax (benefit) rate for the year is lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 35% due to the impact of nondeductible expenses and losses. The effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2001 was much lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate, primarily due to non tax deductible amortization of acquired intangibles and goodwill, which partially offset the U.S. statutory income tax (benefit) rate. The effective income tax rate for 2000 was much higher than the U.S. statutory income tax rate, primarily due to non tax deductible amortization of acquired intangibles and goodwill, in addition to the write offs of non tax deductible IPRD. Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements reconciles the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate. Equity earnings Equity earnings in 2002 were $116 million and declined 22% from 2001, primarily due to the impairment of an equity investment in the second quarter of 2002 for $14 million and a $20 million reduction in equity earnings in the fourth quarter, primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges recorded by Samsung Corning Micro Optics. Excluding these items, equity earnings approximated those in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, equity earnings increased 2 points over 2001, primarily due to the decline in sales. Equity earnings in 2001 were $148 million and relatively flat, compared to 2000. As a percentage of net sales, equity earnings were also relatively flat, compared to 2000. In the first quarter of 2000, Corning discontinued recognition of equity earnings from Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) and recorded a charge to impair its investment for $36 million due to PCCs decision to file for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 for asbestos litigation. See Legal Proceedings and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. (Loss) income from continuing operations As a result of the above, the (loss) income from continuing operations and per share data were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Loss) income from continuing operations $ (1,780) $ (5,532) $ 363 Basic (loss) earnings per common share from continuing operations $ (1.85) $ (5.93) $ 0.42 Diluted (loss) earnings per common share from continuing operations $ (1.85) $ (5.93) $ 0.41 Shares used in computing per share amounts: Basic 1,030 933 858 Diluted 1,030 933 879 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Precision lens business On December 13, 2002, Corning completed the sale of its Cincinnati, OH precision lens business to 3M Company (3M). This business manufactures precision lens assemblies for projection video systems. Corning sold the precision lens business for cash proceeds up to $850 million, of which $50 million has been deposited in an escrow account. A portion of the escrow account balance will be used to pay state income taxes relating to the transaction. The remaining balance plus accrued interest will be paid to Corning in December 2003, subject to any amounts due to 3M relating to certain indemnifications made by Corning. The transaction price is also subject to adjustment due to changes in working capital between signing and closing. In 2002, proceeds from the sale of precision lens were approximately $800 million in cash. The gain on the sale was $415 million, net of tax, which has been recorded in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2003, Corning could record an additional gain on the sale of up to $25 million, net of tax. This amount is conditional upon the ultimate amount paid to Corning from the escrow account. Management currently expects to receive additional proceeds of $10 million from 3M in the first quarter of 2003 and $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, which is currently held in escrow. The precision lens business is accounted for as a discontinued operation and therefore, the results of operations and cash flows have been removed from Cornings results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The precision lens business was part of Cornings former Information Display Segment. The results of operations for the precision lens business have been excluded from the Operating Segments data. Sales from discontinued operations increased 19%, or $43 million in 2002, compared to 2001. The increase was primarily due to continued strong volume growth for digital projection televisions, particularly in North America and Asia, driven by demand for larger size televisions in the entertainment market sector. Excluding the gain on sale, earnings for the business increased more than 85% over 2001 to $63 million as sales volume gains and manufacturing efficiencies from new capacity were realized. Sales from discontinued operations increased 9%, or $18 million in 2001, compared to 2000. The increase was due to the growth of digital projection televisions in the U.S. and in China where the demand for high definition television was growing. Despite the increase in sales, earnings for 2001 decreased approximately 26% to $34 million, primarily due to manufacturing costs related to capacity expansion of projection television assemblies. Summarized selected financial information for the discontinued operations related to the precision lens business is as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales $ 268 $ 225 $ 207 Income before taxes $ 100 $ 50 $ 70 Gain on sale before taxes 652 Provision for income taxes 274 16 24 Net income $ 478 $ 34 $ 46 Distribution of Shares of Quest Diagnostics and Covance Inc. On December 31, 1996, Corning distributed shares of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Covance Inc., which collectively comprised Cornings Health Care Services Segment, to its shareholders on a pro rata basis (the Distributions). Corning agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics on an after tax basis for the settlement of certain government claims and against certain other claims that were pending at December 31, 1996. Coincident with the Distributions, Corning recorded a payable to Quest Diagnostics of approximately $25 million, which was managements best estimate of amounts which were probable of being paid by Corning to Quest Diagnostics to satisfy the remaining indemnified claims on an after tax basis. Quest Diagnostics settled a significant matter with the Department of Justice late in 2000 requiring Corning to reimburse Quest Diagnostics $9 million. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2000 Corning released reserves totaling $13 million after tax in excess of the indemnified settlement between Quest Diagnostics and the Department of Justice. OUTLOOK Corning expects 2003 net sales to approximate 2002, reflecting a year over year decline in the Telecommunications Segment and an improvement in the Technologies Segment. Corning also expects, at a minimum, to significantly reduce operating losses in 2003 versus 2002 as a result of restructuring actions in the second half of 2002 in Telecommunications and an expected strong performance in Technologies. Cornings goal is to return to profitability in 2003 before consideration of restructuring or other one time charges. Cornings goal to return to profitability is dependent upon stabilization of revenues and continued strength in North America and world economies. Corning will begin recognizing equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation in the first quarter of 2003. Corning does not expect to receive any dividends from Dow Corning in 2003. For the first quarter of 2003, Corning expects sales in the range of $700 million to $730 million. Corning expects a net loss in the range of $0.01 per share to $0.04 per share, excluding gains on debt repurchases and restructuring charges in the quarter. This loss is net of expected equity earnings in the range of $10 million to $20 million from Dow Corning. Management continues to believe Corning has sufficient liquidity to meet its funding needs for 2003 and beyond. Corning finished the year with $2.1 billion in cash and short term investments and full access to an unused revolving credit facility of $2.0 billion. Capital spending is expected to approximate $350 million to $450 million in 2003. The anticipated spending will focus primarily on the planned expansion in the liquid crystal display and environmental businesses. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES Corning recorded significant charges in 2002 and 2001. These charges are summarized in the following table and discussed in the following three subsections of Management Discussion and Analysis (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 Impairment of goodwill $ 400 $ 4,648 Restructuring actions 1,271 953 Impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill: Photonic technologies business 269 116 Conventional video components business 140 Total restructuring, impairment and other charges $ 2,080 $ 5,717 Impairment Of Goodwill 2002 Charge As discussed in New Accounting Standards and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in January 2002, Corning adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. Instead, SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 (January 1, 2002) and annually thereafter. Corning performed an initial benchmark assessment upon adoption at January 1, 2002, and determined that a transition charge was not required. Corning chose the fourth quarter to conduct its annual impairment test. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment occurs if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The majority of Cornings goodwill is included in the telecommunications reporting unit, which is the same as the Telecommunications Segment. The test completed in the fourth quarter indicated that the recorded book value of this reporting unit exceeded its fair value, as determined by discounted cash flows. Management believes the telecommunication industry is currently depressed but will ultimately recover. Management does not expect growth in this segment in the short term, but believes that growth will return to this segment by 2005. Cornings view that the industry will recover is based on the fact that bandwidth demand continues to grow currently, and the belief that a combination of public policy changes, consolidation and recovery of industry players, and the advancement of profitable broadband business models will drive recovery in the future. The decrease in fair value from that measured in the benchmark assessment primarily reflects: .. a delay in the timing of the expected recovery from late 2002, or early 2003 to 2005, .. a reduction in the short term cash flow expectations of the fiber and cable business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will occur, and .. a reduction in the short and long term cash flow expectations of the photonic technologies business. Management retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at December 31, 2002. Upon completion of the annual assessment, Corning recorded a non cash impairment charge of $400 million ($294 million after tax) to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of $1.6 billion. Management cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the telecommunications industry does not recover as projected by management in its expected future cash flow estimates. Management must exercise judgment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill. See Critical Accounting Estimates for related discussion. 2001 Charge During the first half of 2001, Corning experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of its Telecommunications Segment, primarily in the photonic technologies business, due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry. During the second quarter, major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. As a result, management determined that the growth prospects of this business were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods. Corning reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. As a result of the business conditions noted above, Corning concluded such an assessment was required for its photonic technologies business in the second quarter. Corning assesses recoverability of the carrying value based upon cumulative expected future pre tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. As a result of this test, Corning determined that the long lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of the Pirelli optical components and devices business (the Pirelli transaction) in December 2000, as well as those of the unit into which NetOptix Corporation (acquired in May 2000) had been integrated, were not recoverable under SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of," which was the governing U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) guidance at that time. The impairment assessment was performed at these levels as discrete cash flows were available for these divisions within the photonic technologies business. Cornings policy is to write down long lived assets to fair value in such circumstances. Management estimated fair value using several techniques. While each method generated comparable fair values, management adjusted the assets to estimates based on average multiples of forecasted revenues and earnings of comparable publicly traded companies with operations in the optical component market segment. This valuation method is consistent with that used in the original valuation of the acquisitions of Net Optix and certain assets from the Pirelli transaction. The fair value of these assets were lower in June 2001 from their acquisition dates as market multiples had changed from those reflected in transactions consummated in 2000. In the second quarter of 2001, Corning recorded pre tax charges of $4,648 million to impair a significant portion of goodwill and $116 million to impair other intangible assets. Of the total goodwill charge of $4,648 million, $3,038 million related to the Pirelli transaction and $1,610 million related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of NetOptix Corporation. In the second quarter of 2001, it was determined that there were events of impairment within portions of the photonic technologies business. The accounting literature effective at that time (SFAS No. 121) required that intangible assets be assessed for recoverability at the lowest level for which discrete cash flows can be measured. As a result of this analysis, Corning recorded a charge of $116 million to impair a portion of the patents acquired in the Pirelli transaction. The valuation methods from which this results are described above. Restructuring Actions 2002 Restructuring Actions The continued decline in demand in the Telecommunications Segment during 2002 required additional restructuring beyond that taken in 2001 to bring manufacturing capacity in line with revenue projections. Corning recorded a total of $1.3 billion in pre tax charges over the second, third and fourth quarters. Actions approved and initiated in 2002 included the following: .. permanent closing of Cornings optical fiber manufacturing facilities in Noble Park, Victoria, Australia, and Neustadt bei Coburg, Germany. Corning also mothballed its optical fiber manufacturing facility in Concord, NC and transferred certain capabilities to its Wilmington, NC facility, .. reductions in capacity and employment in Cornings cabling and hardware and equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs, .. permanent closure of its photonic technologies thin film filter manufacturing facility in Marlborough, MA, .. permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in 2001 in the fiber and cable business within the Telecommunications Segment, .. closure of minor manufacturing facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications Segment, .. closure and consolidation of research facilities, .. elimination of positions worldwide through voluntary and involuntary programs, and .. divestiture of a portion of the controls and connectors business in the Telecommunications Segment. In addition, Corning impaired cost based investments in a number of private telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of 2002 to divest the portfolio. Restructuring Charges The 2002 restructuring charges of $447 million included $376 million of employee separation costs (including special termination and curtailment losses related to pension and postretirement health care plans), $85 million in other exit costs (principally lease termination and contract cancellation payments) and a $14 million credit related to the 2001 restructuring actions. The charge entailed the elimination of approximately 7,100 hourly and salaried positions in the Telecommunications Segment and corporate research and administrative staffs organizations. Employees have been informed of the restructuring initiatives and benefits available to them under applicable benefit plans. These benefits included involuntary separation, early retirement and social programs. Impairment of Plant and Equipment Corning has evaluated the carrying value of the long lived assets at each site impacted by the restructuring actions for impairment. The carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from that asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The impairment charges were determined based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset. Corning recorded $712 million in 2002 to impair plant and equipment related to facilities to be shutdown or disposed, primarily in the fiber and cable business, the photonic technologies business and certain research facilities. The charge was partially offset by an $11 million adjustment to assumed salvage values on asset disposals, related to the 2001 restructuring actions. Of the total charge, $107 million pertained to abandoned construction projects in the fiber and cable business, primarily the latest expansion in Concord, NC and Oklahoma City, OK. A significant portion of the assets impaired were recently acquired, or built in connection with capacity expansions in anticipation of future demand. Most of the impaired facilities are currently available for sale, others will be demolished or abandoned. The remaining impaired equipment will be auctioned, sold, disposed of or abandoned during 2003. Loss on Divestiture In the second quarter of 2002, Corning completed the sale of its appliance controls group which was included in the controls and connectors business in the Telecommunications Segment. In the second and third quarter of 2002, Corning received cash of $24 million, note proceeds of $6 million and recorded a loss on the sale of approximately $16 million ($10 million after tax) which is included in impairment charges. Impairment of Cost Investments During the second and fourth quarters of 2002, Corning recorded total charges of $107 million ($66 million after tax) for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the Telecommunications Segment. In the fourth quarter, Corning decided to divest its remaining portfolio of cost investments in private telecommunications related companies. These investments have been written down to their estimated fair value based upon information available from prospective purchasers. The following table illustrates the charges, credits and balances of the restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2002 (in millions): Remaining Net Cash reserve at January 1, charges/ Non cash payments Dec. 31, 2002 credits charges in 2002 2002 Restructuring charges: Employee related costs $ 198 $ 371 (a) $ 40 $ 256 $ 273 Other charges 78 76 (b) 22 132 Total restructuring charges $ 276 $ 447 $ 40 $ 278 $ 405 Impairment of long lived assets: Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment $ 717 (c) $ 717 Cost investments 107 107 Total impairment charges $ 824 $ 824 Total restructuring and impairment charges and credits $ 1,271 Tax benefit and minority interest 342 Restructuring and impairment charges and credits, net $ 929 (a) Amount is net of $5 million adjustment in employee related costs reflecting the difference between estimated and actual costs. (b) Amount is net of $9 million adjustment in other exit costs reflecting the difference between estimated and actual costs. (c) Amount is net of $11 million adjustment to assumed salvage values on asset disposals and includes $16 million loss on divestiture. The following table illustrates the charges for 2002 restructuring actions as it relates to Cornings operating segments (in millions): Charges for restructuring actions Corporate Functions Telecom Including munications Technologies Research Total Charges for restructuring actions $ 1,053 $ 10 $ 208 $ 1,271 The following table illustrates the headcount reduction amongst U.S. Hourly, U.S. Salaried and Non U.S. positions: Headcount reduction U.S. Hourly U.S. Salaried Non U.S. Total Headcount reduction 1,650 2,950 2,500 7,100 As of December 31, 2002, approximately 5,100 of the 7,100 employees had been separated under the plans. Although Corning expects the remaining employees to be separated by December 31, 2003, the majority of these employees will be separated by the end of the first quarter of 2003. Corning expects approximately one third of the 2002 restructuring charges to be paid in cash. If the restructuring actions are successfully implemented, Corning expects such actions to yield approximately $465 million in annual savings. The savings consist of lower wage and benefit costs, avoided depreciation and fixed costs on closed facilities. Approximately 40% of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales with the remainder split between selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses. 2001 Restructuring Actions In July and October of 2001, Corning announced a series of restructuring actions in response to significant deteriorating business conditions which began initially in its Telecommunications Segment, but eventually spread to its other businesses as the year progressed. The following actions were approved and undertaken in 2001: .. closure of seven major manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of several smaller facilities, in the Telecommunications and Technologies Segments, .. discontinuation of its initiative in Corning Microarray Technology products, part of Cornings life sciences business, and .. elimination of approximately 12,000 positions affecting all operating segments, but especially impacting the photonic technologies, hardware and equipment and the optical fiber and cable businesses. This action included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations. These actions resulted in a pre tax charge totaling $953 million ($585 million after tax and minority interest) for the year ended December 31, 2001. The charge included restructuring costs of $419 million and $542 million for the impairment of plant and equipment of which $3 million and $5 million, respectively related to discontinued operations. Approximately one third of the total charge was expected to be paid in cash. As of December 31, 2002, all of the 12,000 employees had been separated under the plans. Certain obligations of the plans will be paid in 2003 and beyond. The following table illustrates the charges, credits and balances of the restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2001 (in millions): Non Cash Remaining Total cash payments reserve at charges charges in 2001 Dec. 31, 2001 Restructuring charges: Employee related costs $ 324 $ 66 $ 60 $ 198 Other charges 95 17 78 Total restructuring charges $ 419 $ 66 $ 77 $ 276 Impairment of long lived assets: Assets held for use $ 46 $ 46 Assets held for disposal 496 496 Total impairment charges $ 542 $ 542 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 961 Discontinued operations (8) Restructuring and impairment charges from continuing operations 953 Tax benefit and minority interest 368 Restructuring and impairment charges, net $ 585 The following table illustrates the charge for 2001 restructuring actions as it relates to Cornings operating segments (in millions): Charges for restructuring actions Corporate Functions Telecom Including munications Technologies Research Total Charges for restructuring actions $ 640 $ 122 $ 191 $ 953 The following table illustrates the headcount reduction amongst U.S. Hourly, U.S. Salaried and Non U.S. positions: Headcount reduction U.S. Hourly U.S. Salaried Non U.S. Total Headcount reduction 6,000 3,100 2,900 12,000 Impairment Of Long Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill Photonic technologies business The photonic technologies business is a manufacturer of photonic modules and components for the worldwide telecommunications industry and is reported in the Telecommunications Segment. The telecommunications market is undergoing a dramatic decline in demand for telecommunication products as major buyers of network equipment in this industry have reduced their capital spending plans over the past two years and are expected to continue such reductions in the near future. The lack of demand for optical component products started in early 2001 and resulted in restructuring and impairment charges in 2001 and 2002. This negative trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. As disclosed in Cornings third quarter Form 10 Q, certain competitors indicated that they will exit the business and others announced decisions to consolidate or restructure. Corning continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for this business. While certain product lines are promising in the event of industry recovery, the pace and extent of that recovery is uncertain. Alternatives under consideration for this business include staying in the business with scaled down operations or contract manufacturing, partnering, sale or abandonment. In February 2003, Corning announced it would close its optical switching product line and record a pre tax charge of $20 million to $30 million in the first quarter of 2003. As short term projections reflect continued operating and cash losses and the long term expectations are uncertain, it was determined that the long lived assets of this business (property, plant and equipment and patents) should be evaluated for impairment. The impairment evaluation required management to develop operating cash flow projections for each strategic alternative and make assessments as to the probability of each outcome. It was determined that the long lived assets of this business were not recoverable through future cash flows. The assets were written down to estimated salvage value, as this amount is the best reflection of fair value. This resulted in a $269 million ($195 million after tax) write down of the assets, which was reflected in the line item "restructuring, impairment and other charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charge included $90 million related to patents. The estimate of salvage value is an area of management judgement. See Critical Accounting Estimates for related discussion. The remaining long term assets of this business approximate $24 million and are classified as "held for use." Conventional video components business Corning Asahi Video Products Company, a 51% owned consolidated subsidiary, (conventional video components business), is a manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for use in conventional tube televisions and is reported in the Technologies Segment for SFAS No. 131 reporting. The conventional tube television segment of the market in North America is very mature and highly competitive. The market has been impacted by a decline in demand for conventional television glass associated with shifting consumer preference for flat panel and projection television sets, as well as other competing technologies. The segment has also been impacted by dramatic increases in the importation of television glass, tubes and sets from Asia. The conventional television tube market is undergoing intense competition at this time and as a result is experiencing tremendous price pressure. One major customer has already exited this market and industry consolidation continues. Demand from another key customer is uncertain. Competition from imported products has increased significantly within the last year, while the demand for flat screen televisions has been increasing for several years. These trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. These market trends combined with cash losses in this business in the short term indicated an evaluation for the recoverability of the long lived assets of the business was required and management determined that the long lived assets of the business have been impaired. The impairment evaluation required management to develop operating cash flow projections for each strategic alternative and make assessments as to the probability of each outcome. It was determined that the long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows. Management estimated the fair value of the long lived assets, which were limited to property, plant and equipment, using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. This resulted in a $140 million ($44 million after tax and minority interest) write down of the assets, which was reflected in the line item "restructuring, impairment and other charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cash flow realized by this business will be impacted by actions taken by competitors and customers. Should our future performance differ adversely from our projections, Corning could be required to record additional impairment charges. It is also possible that Corning could choose to exit the business should cash flows be less than projected. The remaining net assets of this business approximate $77 million. OPERATING SEGMENTS Corning previously grouped its products into three operating segments: Telecommunications, Advanced Materials and Information Display. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002, Cornings reportable segments consist of the following: Telecommunications and Technologies. As a result of the fourth quarter sale of the precision lens business and the reduced significance of the conventional video components business, management realigned the remainder of the Information Display Segment with the businesses previously reported in Advanced Materials to create the Technologies Segment. The precision lens business is reported as a discontinued operation and therefore its results have been excluded from segment reporting and historical periods have been conformed to this presentation. Also, in the second quarter of 2002, Corning revised its definition of segment net income. Prior to the second quarter, Corning disclosed restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition related charges by segment, but excluded these from quantitative segment results. These charges have now been included in the segment net income and historical periods have been conformed to this presentation. This change was made to increase the transparency of the impact of these charges on segment results. Corning excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition related charges in discussing the results of each business in the segment to provide clarity on the underlying business trends. Corning also includes the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with Cornings operating segments in segment net income. Segment amounts exclude revenues, expenses and equity earnings not specifically identifiable to segments. Corning prepared the financial results for its operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which Corning management internally disaggregates financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. Corning has allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than it would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include interest, taxes and corporate functions. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Telecommunications The Telecommunications Segment produces optical fiber and cable, optical hardware and equipment, photonic modules and components and optical networking devices for the worldwide telecommunications industry. The following table provides net sales for the Telecommunications Segment: Telecommunications (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 859 $ 2,889 $ 2,875 Hardware and equipment 552 817 1,020 Photonic technologies 111 547 1,050 Controls and connectors 109 205 241 Total net sales $ 1,631 $ 4,458 $ 5,186 2002 vs. 2001 This segment incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in 2002 and 2001. The 2002 and 2001 charges are described in detail in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges. The restructuring activities were undertaken to reduce the operating cost structure due to continued market declines. More than half of the 2002 charge is impairment of fixed assets, primarily in the fiber and cable business. A significant portion of the asset impairments in this business represent the closure of two fiber plants and permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in 2001 in the optical fiber and cable business. The balance of the charge represents impairments of cost based investments, primarily in the photonic technologies business, and severance and benefits for retirees and separated personnel in all businesses. In addition, the segment incurred a $400 million charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $269 million charge for long lived asset impairments at photonic technologies. The impairment charge incurred in the second quarter of 2001 relates to goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in the photonic technologies business. These charges are described in Impairment of Goodwill and Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets. Sales in the segment declined 63%, or $2,827 million, from 2001 as each business in the segment experienced a significant decline in volume with the largest declines in optical fiber and cable and the photonic technologies businesses. The segment incurred losses of $1.9 billion in 2002, compared to a net loss of $5.2 billion in 2001. The 2002 loss was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales volume and restructuring and impairment charges. Each business also reported a loss in 2002. The trend between years reflects lower restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding these restructuring and impairment charges, segment net loss was $592 million compared to a loss of $81 million in 2001. The increase in the loss in 2002 reflects reduced sales volumes and lower prices in each business offset by cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions. The optical fiber and cable business is the largest business in the segment. Sales in the optical fiber and cable business declined 70%, or $2,030 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to a sales volume decline for fiber and cable products of more than 50% for the year as well as double digit price declines. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, the optical fiber and cable business incurred a significant loss in 2002, compared to profits in the prior year, primarily due to significantly lower sales volume, declining prices and unfavorable product mix. As discussed in Restructuring Actions, the optical fiber and cable business undertook significant restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. These actions included permanent closure of two international fiber manufacturing plants and the mothballing of the Concord, NC facility. In addition, cabling operations will continue to be consolidated. Corning is not exiting any product or business lines as a result of the decision to reduce capacity, but is adjusting capacity to most efficiently meet expected demand levels through at least the end of 2004. Management believes that the Concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within six to nine months of a decision to do so and construction in progress at the Concord facility can be completed efficiently. Management believes the Concord and Wilmington plants will provide sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future of this business. Sales in the hardware and equipment business decreased 32%, or $265 million, compared to 2001. The sales decreases were primarily due to the overall lack of spending impacting the entire telecommunications industry. Excluding restructuring charges, the business incurred a loss driven by lower volumes and pricing pressure in 2002, compared to a near breakeven performance in 2001. This business also undertook restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. These actions included exiting certain product lines, headcount reductions and asset abandonments. The photonic technologies business manufactures photonic modules and components, primarily for the optical amplification market. Sales in the photonic technologies business declined 80%, or $436 million, compared to 2001, primarily due to lower sales volume as network buildouts in the telecommunications industry declined resulting in much lower demand for photonic products. The business incurred a significant loss for 2002 before restructuring and impairment charges, primarily due to dramatically lower sales volumes. However, the 2002 losses decreased more than 50%, compared to the losses incurred in 2001, which included inventory writedowns of $333 million. The results in 2002 reflect cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions taken in 2001 and 2002. During the second quarter of 2002, the business favorably resolved an open issue from the second quarter of 2001 with a major customer, resulting in the recognition of revenue of $14 million and pre tax income of $3 million. This revenue was recognized in part on shipment of inventory previously reserved. In addition, the business settled an open matter with a significant vendor in 2002 resulting in the reversal of a vendor reserve of $20 million that was recorded as part of the charge in the second quarter of 2001. The lack of demand for optical component products started in early 2001 and resulted in restructuring and impairment charges in 2001 and 2002. This negative trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. As disclosed in Cornings third quarter Form 10 Q, certain competitors indicated that they will exit the business and others announced decisions to consolidate or restructure. Corning continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for this business. While certain product lines are promising in the event of industry recovery, the pace and extent of that recovery is uncertain. Alternatives under consideration for this business include staying in the business with scaled down operations or contract manufacturing, partnering, sale or abandonment. In February 2003, Corning announced it will stop commercialization of its optical switching product in 2003 and will incur pre tax charges of $20 million to $30 million related to the exit representing severance and cash exit costs. Management estimates that severance and exit costs related to a complete abandonment of remaining product lines could approximate $70 million to $80 million in total pre tax charges. The controls and connectors business manufactures high performance oscillators and crystals used in various telecommunications applications. Sales in the controls and connectors business decreased 47%, or $96 million, compared to 2001, due to the sale of the appliance controls group in May 2002 and the lack of capital spending in the telecommunications industry. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were also down due to lower sales volumes as the business incurred a loss for the year, compared to earnings in 2001. The loss on divestiture of $16 million ($10 million after tax) is included in restructuring, impairment and other charges. The business undertook restructuring actions in the fourth quarter that are expected to reduce operating costs in 2003. 2001 vs. 2000 Sales in the Telecommunications Segment decreased 14%, or $728 million from 2000 to $4.5 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the sales decline was 19%. The decrease in sales was primarily due to sales volume decreases in most businesses throughout the segment as capital spending in the telecommunications industry decreased significantly. Segment net income fell precipitously, compared to 2000s strong results as net income in the optical fiber and cable business was more than offset by losses in all other businesses and the significant restructuring and impairment charges. The loss of sales volume in premium fiber and photonic products reduced gross margins and the segment incurred operating charges totaling $333 million ($221 million after tax) to write down excess and obsolete inventory, including estimated purchase commitments, further lowering gross margin percentages. Segment net income for 2000 was impacted by $463 million ($442 million after tax) of acquisition related charges, primarily IPRD. See IPRD section for more detail. Sales in the optical fiber and cable business in 2001 remained flat at $2.9 billion, compared with 2000, although sales declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 4%, compared to 2000. The lack of growth reflects the loss of volume in premium products beginning in the second quarter due to the decline in long haul demand as capital spending for network buildouts diminished and the business began to experience volume decreases in sales of single mode fiber in the third quarter. As a result, most fiber manufacturing facilities were idled in the fourth quarter. Overall, fiber and cable volume decreased approximately 15% for the year as a result of an increase of approximately 30% in the first half of the year, offset by a decrease of approximately 50% in the second half. The weighted average price for Cornings optical fiber and cable products remained relatively stable, compared to 2000, as higher prices were offset by significantly decreased volumes for premium products. Premium fiber as a percentage of total fiber demand was approximately 20% in 2001. Net income for the optical fiber and cable business decreased over 5%, compared to 2000, as the loss of sales volume in premium products was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin single mode products. In response to reduced demand for fiber products, Corning announced it will permanently close its optical fiber operations in Deeside, North Wales and its cabling operations in Saskatoon, Canada in addition to temporarily ceasing production at smaller cabling facilities. Sales in the hardware and equipment business declined 20%, or $203 million in 2001, compared to 2000. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 28%, compared to 2000. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes as capital spending in the cable television industry fell significantly from prior year levels. Business performance decreased significantly to a small loss in 2001 primarily due to considerably lower sales volumes. This business reduced its headcount during the year and closed a small manufacturing facility. Sales in the photonic technologies business declined 48%, or $503 million, compared to 2000. The sales decrease reflected significant declines in orders from major customers caused by the decrease in capital spending in the telecommunications industry. The business incurred a significant operating loss for the year largely due to lower sales volumes, excess capacity, a higher fixed cost structure and charges for excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters. During the second quarter, major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed. As a result, management determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their product life cycle. Corning recorded a charge to writedown excess and obsolete inventory, including estimated purchase commitments, of $273 million ($184 million after tax) in cost of sales in the second quarter of 2001. The business recorded an additional charge of $60 million ($37 million after tax) in the fourth quarter as a result of lower revenue forecasts for 2002. Corning has, or is in the process of disposing all such inventory, except approximately $100 million. Corning has retained and isolated this inventory, and in the unlikely event that product is sold, Corning will fully disclose the impact on its margins. Corning announced a downsizing of the photonic technologies business and closed the following three manufacturing facilities in 2001: .. Benton Park facility in Benton Township, PA, .. Corning Lasertrons facility in Nashua, NH, and .. Monroe Park manufacturing and development operations in Henrietta, NY. In addition, Corning scaled back its photonic technologies operations in Erwin Park, NY and the remainder of its photonic facilities to adjust its manufacturing capacity levels and headcount to lower revenue expectations. The business reduced its headcount approximately 75% from peak employment levels in 2001. Sales in the controls and connectors business decreased 15%, or $36 million in 2001, compared to 2000. Lower sales volume was the primary reason for the decline due to the weak U.S. economy. The business incurred an insignificant loss for the year, compared to an insignificant profit in 2000 due to the depressed volume. Outlook: Business conditions in the Telecommunications Segment have been very difficult due to sharply reduced capital spending by telecommunications companies. Management anticipates that these difficult conditions will continue through at least the end of 2003. While management ultimately expects a recovery, it is difficult to forecast when capital spending by Cornings customers will increase and therefore difficult to predict revenues and earnings in this segment in the short term. Corning expects sales to deteriorate $200 million to $250 million from 2002 sales. The industry continues to experience significant excess capacity, resulting in pricing pressure that is expected to continue throughout 2003. Corning expects the loss in the segment to be significantly less than 2003 due to significantly lower restructuring and impairment charges. The results will also reflect cost savings from actions undertaken in 2002. Technologies The Technologies Segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass, glass ceramic and polymer technologies. Its primary products include liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays, ceramic substrates for automobile and diesel applications, scientific laboratory products, glass panels and funnels for televisions and cathode ray tubes. The following table provides net sales for the Technologies Segment: Technologies (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Net sales: Display technologies $ 405 $ 323 $ 333 Environmental technologies 394 379 411 Life sciences 280 267 248 Conventional video components 166 252 354 Other technologies businesses 268 347 362 Total net sales $ 1,513 $ 1,568 $ 1,708 2002 vs. 2001 Sales in the Technologies Segment during 2002 decreased 4%, or $55 million, compared to 2001, as increased sales in display technologies, environmental technologies and life sciences were offset by much lower sales in the mature conventional video components business, decreased demand for semiconductor materials and the impact of Cornings exit of its lighting products line in 2002. Segment earnings increased 29%, or $27 million, compared to 2001, as improved operating performance in display technologies and the life sciences business and stronger equity earnings were partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials and conventional video components businesses. The 2002 restructuring costs recorded in this segment consisted entirely of severance and benefits for retired and separated employees in several businesses. The impairment charges related to assets held for use in the conventional video components business. See Impairment of Long Lived Assets Other than Goodwill. Sales in the display technologies business, the largest business in the segment and a leading supplier of ultra thin glass substrates used to produce flat panel display, increased 25%, or $82 million, compared to 2001. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume as penetration in the desktop market increased. The prior years sales were negatively impacted by an inventory correction in the industry in the first quarter of 2001. Volume gains of over 46% for the current year were partially offset by price declines of 10% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the business increased over 30% for the year, compared to 2001, primarily due to volume gains and a more than 30% improvement in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision Glass Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision), a Korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass. Both Corning and Samsung Corning Precision have recently approved expansions of manufacturing capacity in Taiwan and Korea, respectively. These capital projects are expected to begin production in 2003. Sales in the environmental technologies business, a manufacturer of catalytic converter substrates, increased 4%, or $15 million, compared to 2001, primarily due to increased U.S. auto production driven by financing incentives and strong growth in Europe and Japan. Earnings in this business improved 8%, compared to 2001, as a significant increase in equity earnings from Cormetech, a U.S. designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts, was partially offset by price declines and increased manufacturing and development costs related to new products. In October 2001, Corning announced the construction of a new diesel emission control product manufacturing facility. The new plant is being built in Erwin, NY. Construction on the project began in 2002 and is expected to be completed in 2004. Sales in the life sciences business, a supplier of advanced microplates and other laboratory products, increased 5%, or $13 million, compared to 2001, primarily due to strong growth in most product lines. Earnings in the business more than doubled over 2001, primarily due to cost savings from the discontinuation of Cornings investment in microarray technology products in the third quarter of 2001, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher sales. Sales in the conventional video components business, a manufacturer of optically pure, mechanically precise face plates and funnels for larger screen television tubes, decreased 34%, or $86 million, compared to 2001. Pricing pressure is strong in this market due to increased competition. A significant portion of this business is concentrated with few customers, two of which have recently merged. One significant customer has exited the business and sales demand from another key customer is uncertain. Management is considering operational and strategic alternatives should the business continue to decline. Corning recorded an impairment of the property, plant and equipment of this business, recognizing a charge of $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. See Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges for further detail. Excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges, the loss in the business increased almost 50% for the year, compared to 2001, primarily due to decreased sales volume and continued competitive pricing pressures. Samsung Corning Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning), a 50% owned manufacturer of glass panels and funnels based in South Korea, also experienced pricing pressure resulting in an approximate 10% decline in equity earnings for 2002, compared to the prior year. Sales in Cornings other technologies businesses, including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products, decreased 23%, or $79 million, compared to 2001. The decrease was led by the exit of the lighting business and lower sales volume of high purity fused silica products in the semiconductor materials business as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at relatively low levels. The businesses incurred a loss for the year compared to break even results in 2001. The losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium fluoride products. 2001 vs. 2000 Sales in 2001 for the Technologies Segment decreased 8%, or $140 million, compared to 2000. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 10%. Sales increases in the life sciences business were more than offset by declines in every other business in this segment. Segment net income also declined in 2001 as the segment recorded net income of $92 million, compared to $270 million in 2000, for a 66% decrease, or $178 million. The decline in profitability was primarily due to restructuring charges and weaker performance by most businesses in the segment, which was partially offset by improved performance in the life sciences business. Sales in the display technology business decreased 3%, or $10 million, in 2001, compared to 2000. A significant shift in customer demand from Japan to Korea caused volume to increase approximately 35% at Samsung Corning Precision and 17% in the consolidated business. This volume growth, when offset by the impact of price declines and the deterioration of the yen, resulted in the sales decline of 3%. Earnings for 2001 decreased approximately 25%, primarily due to lower operating margins driven by pricing pressures, start up costs incurred for the May opening of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan and additional development and engineering expenses for Eagle2000(TM), a new glass substrate used in active matrix liquid crystal displays. Additionally, equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision decreased over 15% compared to 2000, primarily due to Corning having a smaller ownership interest in the company in 2001 versus 2000. Sales in the environmental technologies business decreased 8%, or $32 million, in 2001, compared to 2000. The business experienced lower sales volumes, compared to 2000, due to decreased vehicle production. Volume growth in Asia was more than offset by declining volumes in North America and Europe. Earnings for the year were down almost 50%, primarily due to lower sales volumes, manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new ultra thin wall products, excess capacity and start up costs in South Africa and China. Sales in the life sciences business increased 8%, or $19 million, in 2001, compared to 2000. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in sales volume. Earnings in the base business (excluding microarray technology) almost doubled over 2000, primarily due to a shift to higher margin products in sales mix along with improvements in manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. Overall earnings in the business were diluted due to the investment in microarray technology, which Corning discontinued at the end of 2001. Sales in the conventional video components business decreased 29%, or $102 million, in 2001, compared to 2000. The decline was primarily due to a weak U.S. economy and increased competitive pricing pressure. Earnings were down almost 50% due to lower sales volumes, decreased margins, a production slowdown in the fourth quarter and lower equity earnings. Samsung Corning also experienced lower sales volumes and increased competitive pricing pressure, and thus lower earnings. Sales in Cornings other technologies businesses decreased 4%, or $15 million, in 2001, compared to 2000. Excluding the acquisition of Tropel in March 2001, sales decreased 11%. The decrease was due to softness in the market for ophthalmic products and high purity fused silica. Earnings for the year were approximately breakeven and down slightly, compared to 2000. Lower sales volumes and production slowdowns were partially offset by a marginal increase in equity earnings from Eurokera, a French based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops, which resulted in comparable earnings between years. Corning exited the lighting and tubing businesses in 2002 and shutdown manufacturing facilities in Greenville, OH and Corning, NY. Outlook: Management expects sales in the Technologies Segment to increase in 2003 versus 2002 due to increased desktop monitor penetration rates, continued global clean air emission requirements and a recovery in the semiconductor market. Most businesses in this segment are expected to increase sales with the display technologies business at the forefront. Thus, management anticipates sales may improve $175 million to $225 million over 2002. Corning expects profitability in this segment to improve approximately $100 million to $120 million in 2003, primarily through increased sales volume and the achievement of significant manufacturing gains. This segment includes South Korean based equity companies that generated equity earnings of $124 million in 2002. Political or economic instability in that region could adversely impact these operations and the results of this segment overall. NON SEGMENT RESULTS Cornings non segment results include the operations of Steuben, a crystal glass manufacturer, and equity earnings from small nonstrategic investments that are not aligned with Cornings two operating segments. In addition, the results of operating segments do not include amortization of goodwill, gain on repurchases and retirement of debt and impairment charges related to Pittsburgh Corning Corporation. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Cash Flow and Key 2002 Activities In 2002, Cornings short and long term debt ratings were downgraded to sub investment grade. At this sub investment grade level, Corning is precluded from accessing the short term commercial paper market. Cornings access to the long term debt markets has been and will likely continue to be limited. The terms that Corning could receive on new debt issues will likely be consistent with those generally available to high yield issuers. As an additional source of funds, Corning currently has full unrestricted access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with 16 banks, expiring on August 17, 2005. As of December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. The facility includes one financial covenant limiting the ratio of total debt to total capital, as defined, to not greater than 60%. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, this ratio was 47%. As disclosed in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges, Corning recorded an impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter. Further declines in the fair value of Cornings Telecommunications Segment could cause future impairments of goodwill, tangible or intangible assets or prompt restructuring actions. Such charges could cause a material increase to Cornings debt to capital ratio. On December 13, 2002, Corning completed the sale of its precision lens business to 3M for net proceeds of $787 million in cash. The transaction resulted in a gain of $652 million ($415 million after tax). In addition, Corning could receive an additional $50 million in cash in 2003, the majority of which is currently on deposit in escrow. In July and August 2002, Corning issued 5.75 million shares of 7% Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock having a liquidation preference of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, resulting in gross proceeds of $557 million. The mandatory convertible stock has an annual dividend rate of 7%, payable quarterly in cash. The first dividend payment date was November 16, 2002. The dividends are also payable immediately upon conversion to Corning common sock. At the time Corning issued the Series C convertible preferred stock, a one time dividend was declared for all dividends that will be payable from issuance through the mandatory conversion date of August 16, 2005. Corning secured the payment of the dividends through the issuance of a promissory note and used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Series C preferred stock to purchase $117 million of U.S. treasury securities that were pledged as collateral to secure the payments on the promissory note. As a result, net proceeds of the offering were $440 million. In addition, Corning redeemed the remaining 69 thousand shares of Series B preferred stock for $7 million in August. The Series C preferred stock will automatically convert on the mandatory conversion date of August 16, 2005, into between 50.813 and 62.5 shares of Corning common stock, depending on the then current market price. At any time prior to the mandatory conversion date, holders may elect to convert in whole or part of their shares of Series C preferred stock into 50.813 shares of common stock plus an amount of cash equal to the market value at that time of the pro rata share of the collateral portfolio that secures the promissory note. At December 31, 2002, approximately 4.2 million shares of the Series C preferred stock had been converted into 213.3 million common shares. As the closing price of Corning common stock was $1.60 on July 31, 2002, the holder could immediately convert the Series C preferred stock and obtain a value of $101.72 (50.813 shares valued at $1.60 plus $20.42 in future dividends) indicating that the preferred stock contained a beneficial conversion feature of $1.72 per preferred share. The beneficial conversion totaled approximately $10 million and was charged to the accumulated deficit in the third quarter. The beneficial conversion was also deducted from earnings attributable to common shareholders in the 2002 earnings per share calculations. In March 2001, Corning filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that became effective in the first quarter. The shelf permits the issuance of up to $5.0 billion of various debt and equity securities. Subsequent to the issuance above and as of December 31, 2002, Cornings remaining capacity under its shelf registration was approximately $3.5 billion. Uses of Cash and Key 2002 Activities In addition to funding operations in 2002, Corning used cash for debt repurchases, capital spending and restructuring actions. During 2002, Corning repurchased and retired zero coupon convertible debentures with an accreted value of $493 million in exchange for cash of $308 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Corning recorded gains of $176 million ($108 million after tax) on these transactions for the year ended December 31, 2002. Corning recorded the gain on repurchases as a component of income from continuing operations, as permitted by SFAS No. 145. The remaining debentures may be put back to Corning on November 8, 2005, at $819.54 per debenture and on November 8, 2010, at $905.29 per debenture. Corning has the option of settling this obligation in cash, common stock, or a combination of both. From time to time, Corning may repurchase certain additional debt securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Through February 14, 2003, Corning spent an additional $165 million to repurchase and retire more zero coupon convertible debentures and expects to record a pre tax gain of approximately $34 million in the first quarter of 2003. Corning also spent $233 million to retire its commercial paper borrowings during 2002. Corning had no commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2002, nor does it anticipate issuing commercial paper in the foreseeable future. In total, Corning spent $815 million in 2002 to pay down short and long term debt. Corning reduced its capital spending dramatically in 2002, which reflected the downturn in telecommunications and was part of a comprehensive effort to conserve cash. Capital spending totaled $0.4 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The high level of capital spending in 2001 and 2000 related primarily to capacity expansions in Cornings Telecommunications Segment and expanded research and development facilities. Cornings 2003 capital spending program is expected to be limited to $350 million to $450 million. Capital spending activity in 2003 is primarily expected to be the planned expansion in the liquid crystal display and environmental businesses. During 2002, Corning made payments of $256 million related to employee severance and termination costs and $22 million in other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Corning expects additional payments for actions taken in 2001 and 2002 to approximate $290 million in 2003. In February 2003, Corning announced it will exit its optical switching product line and incur cash charges of $20 million to $30 million. In the third quarter of 2002, Corning repurchased 5.5 million shares of its common stock in a privately negotiated transaction for $23 million. Key Balance Sheet Data At December 31, 2002, cash and short term investments totaled $2.1 billion, compared with $2.2 billion at December 31, 2001. The decrease from December 31, 2001 was primarily due to short and long term debt repayments, restructuring payments and the use of working capital. These items were partially offset by significantly lower capital spending, the sale of the precision lens business and proceeds from the issuance of Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock. Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): As of December 31, 2002 2001 Working capital $2,145 $2,113 Working capital, excluding cash and short term investments $55 $(106) Current assets to current liabilities 2.3:1 2.1:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $470 $593 Days sales outstanding (1) 56 55 Inventories $559 $725 Inventory turns 4.4 4.5 Days payable outstanding 46 42 Long term debt $3,963 $4,463 Total debt to total capital 47% 47% (1) Days sales outstanding are calculated on the fourth quarter of each respective year. The increase in working capital, excluding cash and short term investments, reflected lower short term borrowings and accounts payable and the recognition of an income tax receivable compared to December 31, 2001. The increase in the current ratio was primarily due to the elimination of commercial paper borrowings. Trade accounts receivable and inventories decreased largely due to significantly lower sales and sales volumes compared to 2001. In 2001, tax legislation was enacted in the U.S. that extended the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years. Due to this legislation change, Corning will be able to carryback the anticipated 2002 U.S. federal net operating loss and claim a refund which would not have otherwise been available. Other accounts receivable at December 31, 2002, included a receivable of $192 million as a result of Corning availing itself of this opportunity. Corning expects to receive this refund in the second quarter of 2003. Credit Ratings Cornings credit ratings as of February 18, 2003 were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Rating Last Update Long Term Debt Commercial Paper Standard & Poors BB+ B July 29, 2002 Moodys Ba2 Not Prime July 29, 2002 Fitch BB B July 24, 2002 Note: All three rating agencies maintain a Negative Outlook. In July 2002, all three rating agencies announced a downgrade which is reflected in the ratings above. Should business performance decline further from the levels experienced in 2002, these ratings could receive further review for possible downgrade. Although the sub investment grade ratings preclude Cornings access to the commercial paper market, Cornings overall financial flexibility remains adequate as a result of its cash position, short term investments and committed revolving credit facilities. Cornings debt agreements do not include covenants that accelerate the maturity of borrowings as a result of changes in credit ratings. If business performance should decline further from levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2002, Cornings ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with a duration of greater than one year could be adversely impacted. Such limitation would not significantly impact the Companys current hedging program. In addition, the sub investment grade credit rating has, in some instances, resulted in requirements to deposit cash with counterparties under performance surety bond and letter of credit arrangements. At December 31, 2002, $82 million of restricted cash was included in other long term assets. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Management Assessment of Liquidity Cornings 2002 earnings were not adequate to cover its fixed charges (principally interest and related charges on debt), primarily as a result of losses incurred in Cornings Telecommunications Segment. Cornings earnings will likely not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in 2003. Cornings major source of funds in 2003 will be its cash and short term investments. Management believes Corning has ample liquidity to meet its funding needs for 2003 and beyond, which includes funding operations, restructuring payments, research and development and capital expenditures. Obligations At December 31, 2002, the contractual obligations of Corning were as follows: 2007 and 2003 2004 2005 2006 thereafter Total (In millions) Long term debt $ 191 $ 127 $ 1,910 $ 11 $ 1,964 $ 4,203 Minimum rental commitments 48 42 36 33 195 354 Total contractual cash obligations $ 239 $ 169 $ 1,946 $ 44 $ 2,159 $ 4,557 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 5 years and (In millions) Total 1 year years years years thereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 189 $ 49 $ 5 $ 21 $ 114 Contingent purchase price for acquisitions 126 48 24 2 52 Dow Corning credit facility 150 150 Stand by letters of credit 33 33 Loan guarantees 37 5 1 1 $ 1 29 Total other commercial commitments and contingencies $ 535 $ 135 $ 30 $ 24 $ 1 $ 345 At December 31, 2002, Corning had guaranteed debt of equity affiliates which totaled $14 million. In addition, Corning and certain of its subsidiaries have provided other financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones, stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. Corning has agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning Corporation as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the Bankruptcy Plan as described in Note 10. Management believes the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. Corning has leased equipment from three unconsolidated special purpose entities (SPE) for which the sole purpose is the leasing of equipment to Corning. These SPEs are not consolidated in the 2002 financial statements since the equity investor of the SPE has made a substantial investment that is at risk for the life of the SPE. However, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities in January 2003. Interpretation 46 will require the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE) by the primary beneficiary. Management is still assessing the impacts of this interpretation, however, it is reasonably possible that Corning will be considered the primary beneficiary of the three VIEs, and therefore will consolidate these entities beginning on July 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the total assets in unconsolidated VIEs were $46 million. In addition, Cornings maximum loss exposure as a result of its involvement with these VIEs is $46 million. This amount represents payments that would be due to the VIE in the event of a total loss of the equipment. Corning carries insurance coverage for this risk. Pensions Corning has a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Its largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2002, this plan accounted for 83% of Cornings consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 89% of the related plans assets. In 2002, global capital market developments resulted in negative returns on this plans assets and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the related pension liability. As a result, at December 31, 2002, this U.S. plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) exceeded the fair value of its assets, which required Corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." The effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase pension liabilities by $322 million, increase intangible assets by $61 million and increase other comprehensive loss by $261 million ($161 million after tax). Corning has traditionally contributed to this qualified U.S. pension plan on an annual basis. Over the last ten years, voluntary contributions averaged $25 million a year. Corning has historically contributed in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this U.S. plan until 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Corning made voluntary pension contributions to this U.S. plan of $30 million, resulting in total contributions for the year of $56 million. Corning expects to increase the level of voluntary contributions to this U.S. plan over the next few years. For 2003, Corning anticipates making voluntary contributions totaling $60 million to this plan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that required managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described below. Impairment of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires management to make judgments about the fair value of its reporting unit. Corning measures fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. The determination of expected future cash flows involves judgment. Cornings judgment was based upon our historical experience in the telecommunications business, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. With this input, it is managements expectation that there will be minimal volume growth in the short term, volume growth is assumed to accelerate beginning in 2005 commensurate with overall market recovery. Terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. These cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill. The discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of 11 public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. Corning used a discount rate of 12% in its calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $400 million. Had Corning used a discount rate of 11.5%, the fair value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its carrying value and there would not have been an impairment. Had Corning used a discount rate of 12.5%, the pre tax impairment charge would have been approximately $225 million higher. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," requires management to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. Management must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. Corning concluded events of impairment had occurred in two of its businesses in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the company recorded pre tax charges totaling $409 million. In each circumstance, behavior of external parties, including customers and competitors, were considered in the determination that an assessment for impairment was required. Management must also exercise judgment in the determination of expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated. In both measurements, the carrying value far exceeded the expected cash flows. Management then exercised judgment in determining the fair value of the assets from which the impairment charge was measured. For its photonic technologies business, management based the fair value of its long lived assets on the actual results of recent asset auctions of similar equipment. For the conventional television business, management exercised judgment about alternative volume and sales price scenarios, computed discounted cash flows and assigned its best estimate of probability to each alternative. Management has reduced the useful lives of the fixed assets of this business as a result of this assessment. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions During 2001 and 2002, Corning recorded write downs of property, plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications Segment. Assets impaired were primarily equipment, construction in progress and buildings. Some of the equipment is to be sold and some abandoned. Corning used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment. The estimated salvage values are very low, primarily due to the currently depressed market for telecommunications related equipment. The salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves. Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requires management to exercise judgment about its future results in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, Corning had gross deferred tax assets of $1.8 billion. Corning determined that the likelihood of realization of certain deferred tax assets is less than 50% and recorded valuation allowances of $417 million. If future taxable income differs from managements estimate, adjustments to these allowances will be required and will impact future net income. Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," requires management to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making its determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter, as well as known outcomes in case law. See Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters the Company faces. The most significant matter involving managements most complex judgment is that of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation. There are a number of factors bearing upon the Companys potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, the Companys history of success in defending itself against asbestos claims, the Companys assessment of the strength of its corporate veil defenses, the Companys continuing dialogue with its insurance carriers and the claimants representatives, and other factors. The Companys conclusion, subject to change as future events unfold, is that there is no guarantee that a global settlement can or will be reached, and that it is more likely than not that the Company will continue to litigate. Pension assumptions In 2002, management made a change in assumption that will impact pension expense in future periods. Specifically, management has lowered its expected long term rate of return on pension assets from 9% to 8.5%. Management has not altered the nature of the pension trust investments. Recent asset performance has been below the 9% assumption. As such, it is lowering its long term rate of return assumption. This will increase Cornings pension expense as measured in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pension," compared to amounts recorded in 2002. The increase will approximate $8 million in 2003. IN PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Corning completed a number of purchase acquisitions in 2000. As part of analyzing each of these acquisitions, Corning made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally. Corning based this decision on a number of factors, including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market. Corning also considered its internal research resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology, if any. Corning expects to use the same decision process in the future. In connection with the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method, management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses resulting from such acquisitions. Amounts allocated to purchased IPRD were established through recognized valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry. Certain projects were acquired for which technological feasibility had not been established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative future uses existed. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, "Accounting for Research and Development Costs," as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method," amounts assigned to IPRD meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the purchase. The value allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was determined by the traditional income approach, which discounts expected future debt free income to present value. The discount rates used were specific to each project and were derived from a cost of capital for each specific acquisition target, adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project. Expected future debt free income was derived with the following considerations: .. revenues were estimated based on relevant market size, growth trends in the industry and individual product sales cycles, .. estimated operating expenses included cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses to maintain the products once they have been introduced, .. estimated tax expenses were specific to each acquired entity and its tax profile, and .. for certain projects, as appropriate, a return on core technology was deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a return on assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons. The nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning, designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations. Corning expected that products incorporating the acquired technology from these projects will be completed and will begin to generate cash flows over the five years following integration. The timing and success of development of the technologies not abandoned remains a risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products and significant competition in the marketplace. The following is a more detailed discussion of the valuations associated with acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded: Acquisition of Pirellis Optical Components and Devices Business On December 12, 2000, Corning completed the Pirelli transaction. This business had a significant number of research and development projects ongoing at the time of acquisition of which 12 were valued as IPRD projects. Projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of 17% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for this entity. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. Corning recorded a non tax deductible IPRD charge of $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Costs to complete the in process research programs were originally estimated to approximate $25 million to $30 million at the valuation date. These projects have been categorized into four product technologies as follows: Lithium Niobate Modulators The business is developing a number of different lithium niobate modulators. Lithium niobate modulators are ideally suited for use in high speed, long haul optical communications networks. The technology has been chosen by a majority of long haul equipment suppliers because it has the best combination of optical, electronic and reliability performance. Five of the research projects qualified as IPRD projects and the completion percentages of these five projects ranged from 10% to 90%. A non tax deductible charge of $235 million was recognized and the value of individual modulator projects in process ranged from $19 million to $83 million. Corning plans to continue research on lithium niobate modulators. However, due to the downturn in the telecommunications industry future revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated. Submarine Products The business had planned to develop high reliability 980 nanometer (nm) pump laser chips and modules for submarine use. These devices are components within an optical amplifier. At the acquisition date, two IPRD projects with completion percentages of 10% and 50% were valued. A non tax deductible charge of $26 million resulted from 980 nm pump laser submarine projects in process. Individual research values were $3 million and $23 million. As part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on July 9, 2001, Corning abandoned this project. This action did not have a material impact on cash flow, or the results of operations. Gratings At the date of acquisition, three qualifying gratings programs with completion percentages ranging from 20% to 85% were valued. A non tax deductible IPRD charge of $16 million resulted from gratings programs. Individual in process projects were valued between $2 million and $11 million. As part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on July 9, 2001, Corning abandoned this project. This action did not have a material impact on cash flow, or the results of operations. Specialty Fiber Two specialty fiber programs at the business met the definition of IPRD. Specialty fibers are used in conjunction with several other components to make an erbium doped fiber amplifier, which boosts the strength of the optical signal. At the acquisition date, these projects were 40% and 60% complete. A non tax deductible IPRD charge of $46 million resulted from specialty fiber programs, with the largest program being valued at $42 million. Corning plans to continue research in specialty fiber. IntelliSense On June 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of IntelliSense, a manufacturer and developer of micro electro mechanical systems (MEMs), or small electro mechanical, micro fabricated devices. MEMs technology, when integrated with optics and packaging expertise, enables the development of optical add drop switches and optical cross connects, that are expected to play a key role in the development and buildout of the optical networking layer. As of the acquisition date, IntelliSense had three qualifying research projects underway. These research and development projects are anticipated to result primarily in the development of new telecommunications products. Projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of 20% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for IntelliSense. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 10% to 90%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $20 million. Corning recorded a $7 million IPRD charge in the second quarter of 2000. No project valued exceeded $5 million. Failure of any single project would not materially impact Cornings financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. As of December 31, 2002, one of the projects has been canceled, the other two projects are continuing with one at a reduced level. As a result, the future revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated. NZ Applied Technologies On May 5, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of NZ Applied Technologies (NZAT). NZAT was developing a line of high speed, solid state components for dense wavelength division multiplexing systems, such as variable optical attenuators, that will meet industry demands for speed and quality. Of these projects, four were determined to meet the criteria for purchased IPRD as of the acquisition date. Projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of 21% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for NZAT. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 10% to 80%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $10 million. A $44 million non tax deductible IPRD charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from $1 million to $29 million. In the third quarter of 2002, due to the significant downturn in demand for telecommunication products, Corning decided to suspend the research related to these projects. When the demand for Cornings telecommunication products rebound, management will reevaluate the market at that time and a decision will be made as to whether research and development on these projects should resume. Photonics Technology Research Center On February 14, 2000, Corning acquired the Photonics Technology Research Center (PTRC). Located in Suffolk, UK, the PTRC had extensive research and development efforts underway at the acquisition date including work on planar integrated optics, semiconductor optical amplifiers, electro absorption modulators and optical networking devices. Seven projects were determined to meet the criteria for purchased IPRD. Projected debt free income was determined for each of the projects and initially discounted using a rate of 35% to reflect the weighted average cost of capital (entity risk) for PTRC. Each product was also discounted to account for the research projects stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 50% to 80%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $40 million. A $42 million ($25 million after tax) IPRD charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from less than $1 million to $16 million. In the fourth quarter of 2002, due to the significant downturn in demand for telecommunication products, Corning announced it would close this facility and abandon most of the projects. Research will continue related to semiconductor optical amplifiers and electro absorption modulators at other research facilities. As a result, the future revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated. ENVIRONMENT Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 12 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. Corning has accrued approximately $22 million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at December 31, 2002. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of Cornings estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Among other provisions, all future business combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited for transactions initiated after June 30, 2001. In addition, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually. SFAS No. 142 was effective for Corning on January 1, 2002. An assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption was completed in the first quarter indicating that the carrying value of goodwill was recoverable. At December 31, 2002, goodwill approximated $1.7 billion. Corning recorded a $400 million ($294 million after tax) charge for impairment of a portion of the goodwill in its Telecommunications Segment after completing its annual assessment in the fourth quarter. See Impairment of Goodwill for further discussion of the charge recorded. The following table presents a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share to adjusted net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share, as if SFAS No. 142 had been in effect as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Reported net (loss) income $ (1,302) $ (5,498) $ 422 Goodwill amortization, net of income taxes 345 203 Adjusted net (loss) income $ (1,302) $ (5,153) $ 625 Reported net (loss) income per share basic $ (1.39) $ (5.89) $ 0.49 Goodwill amortization, net of income taxes 0.37 0.24 Adjusted net (loss) income per share basic $ (1.39) $ (5.52) $ 0.73 Reported net (loss) income per share diluted $ (1.39) $ (5.89) $ 0.48 Goodwill amortization, net of income taxes 0.37 0.23 Adjusted net (loss) income per share diluted $ (1.39) $ (5.52) $ 0.71 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Corning was required to implement SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This standard supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. Corning adopted SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. Corning has followed this standard to measure impairments of long lived assets through 2002 and report business divestitures. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, which rescinds SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," SFAS No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers" and SFAS No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements" and amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." This statement updates, clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements. As a result of rescinding SFAS No. 4 and SFAS No. 64, the criteria in Accounting Principles Bulletin (APB) No. 30 will be used to classify gains and losses from extinguishment of debt. Corning adopted the reporting guidance of SFAS No. 145 in the second quarter of 2002 in its accounting for repurchases and retirement of debt. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining provisions of SFAS No. 145 will be adopted by Corning in fiscal year 2003. Corning does not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This standard nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." This standard requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. Corning is required to implement SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. Corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees. The Interpretation requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee. The provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Corning does not expect this Interpretation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123," which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123. In addition, the statement mandates certain interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by SFAS No. 123. Corning will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25. As such, Corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Corning has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 148 at December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," which requires all VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the VIE. In addition, the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both VIEs that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests, but not the majority. The disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Management is still assessing the impacts of this interpretation, however, it is reasonably possible that Corning will be considered the primary beneficiary of three existing SPEs and therefore would need to consolidate these entities beginning on July 1, 2003. The assets and debt of these entities at December 31, 2002, approximates $46 million. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the SEC on Forms 10 Q and 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, product demand and industry capacity, competitive products and pricing, sufficiency of manufacturing capacity and efficiencies, cost reductions, availability and costs of critical materials, new product development and commercialization, attracting and retaining key personnel, order activity and demand from major customers, fluctuations in capital spending by customers in the telecommunications industry and other business segments, financial condition of customers, changes in the mix of sales between premium and non premium products, facility expansions and new plant start up costs, adverse litigation or regulatory developments, including future or pending tax legislation, adequacy and availability of insurance, capital resource and cash flow activities, capital spending, equity company activities, interest costs, acquisition and divestiture activity, the rate of technology change, the ability to enforce patents, product performance issues, stock price fluctuations, and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Cornings exposure to exchange rate effects includes: .. exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and .. exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact Cornings net equity. Cornings most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Western European countries. Corning selectively enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 12 months or less to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on Cornings operating results. Corning also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where its foreign subsidiaries or Corning Incorporated enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Corning holds a derivative contract that hedges certain foreign currency denominated net asset exposures. Corning does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Equity in earnings of associated companies has historically represented a significant amount of Cornings (loss) income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies net of impairments was $116 million in 2002 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 100% of this amount due to the impairments recorded in equity income. Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision Glass totaled $124 million in equity earnings for 2002. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies. Corning uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2002, Corning and its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts, open option contracts, foreign denominated debt and foreign cash and cash equivalent holdings with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2002. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $117 million. The nature of Cornings foreign exchange rate risk exposures has not changed materially from December 31, 2001. Interest Rate Risk Management In March and April of 2002, Corning entered into interest rate swaps that are fair value hedges and economically exchanged $275 million of fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, Corning will pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the six month LIBOR rate and receive the fixed rates of 8.3% to 8.875%, which are the stated interest rates on the long term debt instruments. As a result of these transactions, Corning is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. The interest rate on these instruments is reset every six months and they expire in 14 to 23 years. It is Cornings policy to conservatively manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. Cornings policy is that total floating and variable rate debt will not exceed 35% of the total debt portfolio at anytime. At December 31, 2002, Cornings consolidated debt portfolio contained approximately 8% of variable rate instruments.
