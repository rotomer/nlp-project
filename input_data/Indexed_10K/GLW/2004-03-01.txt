Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Corning had three significant priorities in 2003: to protect our financial health, to restore profitability, and to invest in our future. We have made significant progress towards all three in 2003. Financial Health We have improved our balance sheet in 2003 by substantially decreasing our debt from $4.2 billion at the beginning of the year to $2.8 billion. We reduced debt by using cash on hand and by completing equity offerings of 45 million shares of our common stock for proceeds of $363 million in the third quarter and 50 million shares of our common stock for proceeds of $267 million in the second quarter. These actions improved our debt to capital ratio from 47% at the end of 2002 to 34% at the end of 2003. We have $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets. Our major source of funding for 2004 and beyond will be our existing balance of cash and short term investments. From time to time, we may also issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, restructuring liabilities, the asbestos settlement, research and development expenditures, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. Profitability On an overall basis, we believe that our 2003 results reflect positive developments including significant growth in our display technologies business, stabilization in our Telecommunications segment, and exiting our photonics and conventional video components product lines. We incurred a net loss of $223 million, or $0.18 per share in 2003 compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion, or $1.39 per share, in 2002, and a net loss of $5.5 billion, or $5.89 per share, in 2001. The improvements were driven primarily by a reduction in restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits to $111 million ($26 million after tax and minority interest) in 2003 compared to $2.1 billion ($1.5 billion after tax) in 2002 and $5.7 billion ($5.3 billion after tax) in 2001. Our $223 million net loss in 2003 included the following: .. a charge of $413 million ($263 million after tax) related to the pending asbestos settlement of current and future tort claims in connection with a proposed reorganization plan for our PCC equity affiliate, .. a net gain on repurchases of debt of $19 million ($12 million after tax), and .. an after tax charge in equity earnings of $66 million related to an asset impairment charge recorded by Samsung Corning, a 50% owned equity venture which manufactures glass funnels and panels for conventional television. Sales in the Telecommunications segment have stabilized, remaining relatively flat from the third quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter 2003. We have been able to reduce the loss in the Telecommunications segment in 2003 by closing plants and reducing costs. Demand for many of our products, particularly in photonics, remained soft. In July 2003, we completed the sale of certain photonics assets to Avanex, and in December 2003, our final shipment of pump lasers for sale to Avanex was completed. Sales and earnings in our Technologies segment improved primarily due to the results of our display technologies business. Sales of this business grew from $93 million in the first quarter of 2002 to $199 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Offsetting the improvement in the display technologies business, the market for conventional televisions declined. As a result, we agreed with our partner to shutdown CAV, a 51% consolidated venture that manufactured conventional video components products. In addition, demand for high purity fused silica and calcium fluoride products was lower than we had anticipated. Therefore, we decided to consolidate the operations of our semiconductor materials products in the fourth quarter of 2003 to make our infrastructure more flexible for the cyclical nature of this market. Investing in our future We remain committed to investing in innovation, and we are investing in a wide variety of technologies including liquid crystal displays, diesel filters and substrates, and the optical fiber, cable, and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises. Although our spending in research, development and engineering has declined, as a percentage of sales it remains above historic levels. We have also continued to invest in capital spending in the Technologies segment. Capital spending in 2003 and 2002 approximated $370 million and $360 million, respectively, the majority of which was to expand capacity for liquid crystal display glass and for new capacity for diesel substrates and filters. As a result of market expansion, in 2004 we expect our consolidated capital spending to approximate $600 million to $650 million, of which $425 million to $475 million will be to expand capacity for liquid crystal display glass production. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Net sales $ 3,090 $ 3,164 $ 6,047 Gross margin $ 849 $ 602 $ 1,820 (gross margin %) 27% 19% 30% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 599 $ 716 $ 1,090 (as a % of revenues) 19% 23% 18% Research, development and engineering expenses $ 344 $ 483 $ 622 (as a % of revenues) 11% 15% 10% Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits $ 111 $ 2,080 $ 5,717 (as a % of revenues) 4% 66% 95% Asbestos settlement $ 413 (as a % of revenues) 13% Operating loss $ (655) $ (2,720) $ (6,048) (as a % of revenues) (21)% (86)% (100)% Gain on repurchases and retirement of debt, net $ 19 $ 176 (as a % of revenues) 1% 6% Benefit for income taxes $ (254) $ (726) $ (468) (as a % of revenues) (8)% (23)% (8)% Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments $ 209 $ 116 $ 148 (as a % of revenues) 7% 4% 2% Loss from continuing operations $ (223) $ (1,780) $ (5,532) (as a % of revenues) (7)% (56)% (91)% Net sales Consolidated net sales for 2003 were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 2%, or $74 million, compared to 2002. Approximately $158 million of the sales decline occurred in the photonic technologies and the conventional television glass products that we exited during 2003. Based on the exchange rates at the beginning of 2003, our sales were favorably impacted by the weakening U.S. dollar against the Yen and the Euro by approximately $85 million. Consolidated net sales for 2002 were $3.2 billion, a decrease of 48%, or $2.9 billion, from 2001 sales of $6.0 billion. The sales decline was most pronounced in the Telecommunications segment where significantly lower demand and price declines for our optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies products caused sales to decrease in this segment by 63%, or $2.8 billion year to year. Sales in the Technologies segment for 2002 decreased 4%, or $55 million, compared to 2001. Gross margin As a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved eight points in 2003 compared to 2002. The improvement was driven by lower depreciation and other fixed costs resulting from the 2002 restructuring actions, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. Gross margin improved in both segments; however, the gains achieved in the Technologies segment were partially offset by a $13 million write down of inventory related to the exit of CAV. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased from 30% to 19% in 2002 compared to 2001. Gross margin was impacted by lower sales volumes in the Telecommunications segment which were insufficient to cover fixed manufacturing costs. Downward pricing pressure also negatively impacted gross margins, primarily in the optical fiber and cable products. These negative trends were offset by significant fixed cost reductions as manufacturing capacity was shutdown. Gross margin in the Technologies segment decreased approximately two points from 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses decreased 16%, or $117 million, in 2003 compared to 2002 and as a percentage of sales improved four points in the same period. The improvement reflects cost savings primarily from the 2002 and 2003 restructuring actions. SG&A expenses decreased 34% to $716 million in 2002 while SG&A increased five points as a percentage of net sales to 23% over 2001. The decrease in SG&A for 2002 reflects cost savings from the restructuring actions which began in 2001, while the increase as a percentage of net sales was caused by the more significant decline in revenues. Research, development and engineering expenses Research, development and engineering ("RD&E") expenses decreased 29%, or $139 million in 2003 compared to 2002 and as a percentage of sales improved four points in the same period. The improvement reflects the cost savings which resulted from the 2002 restructuring actions. RD&E expenses declined 22%, or $139 million in 2002 compared to 2001. As a percentage of net sales, RD&E increased five points from 2001. The decrease in expense for 2002 reflects the impact of the restructuring actions, while the increase as a percentage of net sales was caused by the more significant decline in revenues. Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits Corning recorded significant net charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001. These charges are summarized in the following table (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Impairment of goodwill $ 400 $ 4,648 Restructuring actions $ 49 1,271 953 Impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill: Photonic technologies 269 116 Conventional video components 62 140 Total restructuring, impairment and other charges $ 111 $ 2,080 $ 5,717 Impairment of Goodwill 2003 Annual Assessment Due to market conditions in the telecommunications and semiconductor industries, we performed goodwill impairment tests for our Telecommunications and specialty materials reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2003. The results of our impairment tests indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book value. Although an impairment charge was not required in 2003, it is possible that future impairment charges may be required if our expected future cash flow estimates are not realized. Management must exercise judgment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill. See Critical Accounting Estimates for related discussion. We believe the telecommunication industry is currently depressed but will ultimately recover. We do not expect growth in this segment in the short term, but believe that growth will return to this segment by 2005. Our view that the industry will recover is based on the fact that bandwidth demand continues to grow, and the belief that a combination of public policy changes, consolidation and recovery of industry players, and the advancement of profitable broadband business models will drive recovery in the future. We believe the specialty materials reporting unit decrease in sales in 2003 was primarily due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market. We expect increased volume growth beginning in 2004. 2002 Charge In the fourth quarter of 2002, we conducted our annual impairment tests and concluded that an impairment charge of $400 million ($294 million after tax) was necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the Telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of $1.6 billion. The decrease in fair value at the end of 2002 from that measured in the initial benchmark assessment on January 1, 2002 primarily reflected the following: . a delay in the timing of the expected recovery from late 2002, or early 2003 to 2005, . a reduction in the short term cash flow expectations of the fiber and cable business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will occur, and . a reduction in the short and long term cash flow expectations of the photonic technologies product line. We retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of our tangible and identifiable intangible assets for the purpose of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at December 31, 2002. 2001 Charge During the first half of 2001, we experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of our Telecommunications segment, primarily in the photonics technologies product line due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry, and determined that there were events of impairment within photonics. We determined that our goodwill related to photonics was not recoverable under SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed of," which was the governing accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") guidance at that time. As a result, we recorded a charge of $4.6 billion to impair a significant portion of goodwill, of which $3.0 billion related to the Pirelli transaction and $1.6 billion related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of NetOptix Corporation. Restructuring Actions 2003 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net charges of $49 million ($14 million credit after tax and minority interest) in 2003. Major actions approved and initiated in 2003 included the following: . the shutdown of CAV, which was a manufacturer of glass panel and funnels for use in conventional tube televisions within the Technologies segment, . the sale and exit of our photonics products within the Telecommunications segment, and . the shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing facilities, which are within the Technologies segment. Restructuring Charges The 2003 restructuring charges of $41 million included $90 million of employee separation costs (including special termination and curtailment losses related to pension and postretirement health care plans) and $37 million in other exit costs (principally lease termination and contract cancellation payments), offset by an $86 million credit related to previous restructuring actions. These credits were primarily the result of revised cost estimates of existing restructuring plans and a decision to not exit two small cabling sites. The charge entailed the elimination of approximately 1,975 hourly and salaried positions including involuntary separation, early retirement and social programs. In addition, we recorded a $20 million foreign deferred tax benefit adjustment related to restructuring charges recorded in 2002. This credit is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under, "Benefit for income taxes." Impairment of Plant and Equipment to be Shutdown or Disposed Corning recorded a net credit of $21 million in 2003. This included $40 million of charges to impair plant and equipment related to facilities to be shutdown or disposed, which comprised $11 million for the North Brookfield semiconductor materials plant closure, $14 million related to a cabling plant, $10 million related to the final exit of photonics, and $5 million of other various costs. The impairment charges were determined based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset. The charge was more than offset by $61 million in credits related to previous restructuring actions. These credits were primarily the result of our decision not to exit two of the previous cabling sites marked for shutdown in 2002 as well as proceeds on asset disposals exceeding assumed salvage values. Impairment of Cost Investments In the first quarter, we recorded a $5 million charge for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the Telecommunications segment. In the third quarter, we sold these investments for $4 million in cash, which was $1 million more than previously expected. We reported this gain as a credit to restructuring actions. Loss on Sale of Photonics We recorded a loss of $13 million in the third quarter when we completed the sale of certain photonic technologies assets to Avanex. In exchange for our photonics assets and $22 million in cash, we received 21 million restricted shares of Avanex common stock, which we valued at approximately $53 million. These shares are restricted from sale for approximately one year at which point the restrictions are lifted at intervals beginning July 2004 and ending October 2005. As the shares become unrestricted, we will mark to market the shares through other comprehensive income as available for sale securities. The Avanex restricted shares are reflected as a cost investment and recorded under "Investments" in our consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 400 employees of the photonic technologies products became employees of Avanex in the third quarter. The loss on sale included a $21 million reduction of our goodwill. See Notes 5 (Restructuring Actions) and 10 (Investments) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. In addition to these restructuring action costs, we also incurred the following charges in our consolidated statement of operations related to the exit of photonics: . an increase to the deferred tax valuation allowance by $21 million as we do not expect to realize certain deferred tax assets in Italy, which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under, "Benefit for income taxes," and . a $7 million impairment charge for equity investments that were abandoned as part of the exit from photonics, which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under, "Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments." Accelerated Depreciation We recorded $12 million of accelerated depreciation as a result of our decision to shutdown our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in Charleston, South Carolina by March 31, 2004. We will record an additional $36 million in the first quarter of 2004 while the plant continues operating. The following table summarizes the charges, credits and balances of the restructuring reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2003 Remaining Reversals Net Non cash Cash reserve at January 1, to existing charges/ uses payments Dec. 31, 2003 Charges plans (reversals) in 2003 in 2003 2003 Restructuring: Employee related costs $ 273 $ 90 $ (63) $ 27 $ (27) $ (195) $ 78 Exit costs 132 37 (23) 14 (38) 108 Total restructuring charges $ 405 $ 127 $ (86) $ 41 $ (27) $ (233) $ 186 Impairment: Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment $ 40 $ (61) $ (21) Cost investments 5 (1) 4 Total impairment charges $ 45 $ (62) $ (17) Other: Loss on Avanex transaction $ 13 $ 13 Accelerated depreciation 12 12 Total other charges $ 25 $ 25 Total restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits $ 197 $ (148) $ 49 Tax (benefit) expense and minority interest (83) 20 (63) Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, net $ 114 $ (128) $ (14) Cash payments for employee related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2004, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2005. We expect approximately one half of the 2003 restructuring charges to be paid in cash. The following table summarizes the net charge (reversals) for 2003 restructuring actions by operating segment (in millions): Corporate Functions Telecom Including munications Technologies Research Total Net charges (reversals) for restructuring actions $ (36) $ 72 $ 13 $ 49 The following table summarizes the headcount reduction related to the 2003 plans: U.S. Hourly U.S. Salaried Non U.S. Total Headcount reduction 975 750 250 1,975 As of December 31, 2003, approximately 1,600 of the 1,975 employees had been separated under the 2003 plans. We expect the remaining to be separated by December 31, 2004, with the majority to be separated by the end of the first quarter of 2004. 2002 Restructuring Actions The continued decline in demand in the Telecommunications segment during 2002 required additional restructuring beyond that taken in 2001 to bring manufacturing capacity in line with revenue projections. We recorded total charges of $1.3 billion ($929 million after tax and minority interest) over the second, third and fourth quarters. Actions approved and initiated in 2002 included the following: . permanent closing of our optical fiber manufacturing facilities in Noble Park, Victoria, Australia, and Neustadt bei Coburg, Germany. We also mothballed our optical fiber manufacturing facility in Concord, North Carolina and transferred certain capabilities to our Wilmington, North Carolina facility, . reductions in capacity and employment in our cabling and hardware and equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs, . permanent closure of our photonic technologies thin film filter manufacturing facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts, . permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in 2001 in the fiber and cable business within the Telecommunications segment, . closure of minor manufacturing facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications segment, . closure and consolidation of research facilities, . elimination of positions worldwide through voluntary and involuntary programs, and . divestiture of a portion of the controls and connectors product line in the Telecommunications segment. In addition, we impaired cost based investments in a number of private telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of 2002 to divest the portfolio. The following table summarizes the charges, credits and balances of the restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2002 (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2002 Remaining Reversals Net Non cash Cash reserve at January 1, to existing charges/ uses payments Dec. 31, 2002 Charges plans (reversals) in 2002 in 2002 2002 Restructuring: Employee related costs $ 198 $ 376 $ (5) $ 371 $ (40) $ (256) $ 273 Exit costs 78 85 (9) 76 (22) 132 Total restructuring charges $ 276 $ 461 $ (14) $ 447 $ (40) $ (278) $ 405 Impairment: Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment $ 712 $ (11) $ 701 Cost investments 107 107 Total impairment charges $ 819 $ (11) $ 808 Other: Loss on divestiture $ 16 $ 16 Total restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits $ 1,296 $ (25) $ 1,271 Tax (benefit) expense and minority interest (352) 10 (342) Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, net $ 944 $ (15) $ 929 The following table summarizes the net charges (reversals) for 2002 restructuring actions by operating segment (in millions): Corporate Functions Telecom Including munications Technologies Research Total Net charges for restructuring actions $ 1,053 $ 10 $ 208 $ 1,271 The following table summarizes the headcount reduction related to the 2002 plans: U.S. Hourly U.S. Salaried Non U.S. Total Headcount reduction 1,650 2,950 2,500 7,100 As of December 31, 2003, all of the 7,100 employees from the 2002 plan had been separated. 2001 Restructuring Actions In July and October of 2001, we announced a series of restructuring actions in response to significant deteriorating business conditions which began initially in our Telecommunications segment, but eventually spread to our other businesses as the year progressed. The following actions were approved and undertaken in 2001: . closure of seven major manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of several smaller facilities in the Telecommunications and Technologies segments, . discontinuation of our initiative in Corning Microarray Technology products, part of our life sciences products, and . elimination of approximately 12,000 positions affecting all operating segments, but especially impacting the photonic technologies, hardware and equipment and the optical fiber and cable products. This action included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations. These actions resulted in a pre tax charge totaling $953 million ($585 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Approximately one third of the total charge was expected to be paid in cash. The following table summarizes the charges, credits and balances of the restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2001 (in millions): Non cash Cash Remaining Total uses payments reserve at charges in 2001 in 2001 Dec. 31, 2001 Restructuring charges: Employee related costs $ 324 $ (66) $ (60) $ 198 Exit costs 95 (17) 78 Total restructuring charges $ 419 $ (66) $ (77) $ 276 Impairment: Assets held for use $ 46 Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment 496 Total impairment charges $ 542 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 961 Discontinued operations (8) Restructuring and impairment charges from continuing operations 953 Tax benefit and minority interest 368 Restructuring and impairment charges, net $ 585 The following table summarizes the charge for 2001 restructuring actions by operating segment (in millions): Corporate Functions Telecom Including munications Technologies Research Total Charges for restructuring actions $ 640 $ 122 $ 191 $ 953 The following table summarizes the headcount reduction related to the 2001 plans: U.S. Hourly U.S. Salaried Non U.S. Total Headcount reduction 6,000 3,100 2,900 12,000 As of December 31, 2002, all of the 12,000 employees had been separated under the plans. Impairment Of Long Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill Given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing our businesses, at various times throughout 2001 to 2003, we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our long lived assets. In each case that an impairment evaluation was required, we developed operating cash flow projections for each strategic alternative and made assessments as to the probability of each outcome. If our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows, we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets, which were limited to property, plant and equipment, using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. 2003 Impairment Charge In April 2003, we announced that we had agreed with our partner to shutdown CAV and wrote down its assets to their estimated salvage values. This resulted in an impairment charge of $62 million ($19 million after tax and minority interest). Subsequent to our decision to exit, CAV signed a definitive agreement to sell tangible assets to Henan Anyang CPT Glass Bulb Group, Electronic Glass Co., Ltd. (Henan Anyang), located in China, for amounts exceeding estimated salvage values. Upon the receipt of $10 million in cash, we recognized a $5 million credit in restructuring. We expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2004 at which time we anticipate recognizing an additional gain of approximately $40 million ($13 million after tax and minority interest). 2002 Impairment Charges Photonic technologies In 2002, the telecommunications market underwent a dramatic decline in demand for its products as major buyers of network equipment in this industry reduced their capital spending. This negative trend was expected to continue into the foreseeable future. As a result of our impairment evaluation, the photonics assets were written down to estimated salvage value, as this amount was our best estimate of fair value. This resulted in a $269 million ($195 million after tax) write down of the long lived assets including $90 million related to patents. Conventional video components In 2002, the market was impacted by a decline in demand for conventional television glass and a dramatic increase in the importation of television glass, tubes and sets from Asia. These trends were expected to continue into the foreseeable future. As a result of our impairment evaluation, CAVs assets were written down to their estimated fair values. This resulted in a $140 million ($44 million after tax and minority interest) write down of the assets. 2001 Impairment Charges Photonic technologies In 2001, the telecommunications markets dramatic decline began. We performed an asset impairment evaluation of our photonics product line and incurred a charge of $116 million to write down intangible assets to their estimated fair values. Asbestos settlement On March 28, 2003, we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future non premises asbestos claims against us and PCC, which might arise from PCC products or operations. The agreement is expected to be incorporated into a settlement fund as part of a reorganization plan for PCC. The plan will be submitted to the federal bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh for approval, and is subject to a number of contingencies, including a favorable vote by 75% of the asbestos claimants voting on the PCC reorganization plan. We will make our contributions to the settlement trust under the agreement after the plan is approved, becomes effective and is no longer subject to appeal. We expect the approval process to be complete in 2004. When the plan becomes effective, our settlement will require the contribution of our equity interest in PCC, our one half equity interest in PCE, and 25 million shares of our common stock. The common stock will be marked to market each quarter until it is contributed to the settlement trust, thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate. We will also make cash payments with a current value of $136 million over six years beginning in June 2005 which we will accelerate, as needed, to maximize the related tax benefits. In addition, we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement. We recorded an initial charge of $298 million in the first quarter of 2003 to reflect the terms of the settlement and additional charges of $115 million to reflect the mark to market of our common stock through December 31, 2003. Total charges of $413 million ($263 million after tax) were incurred for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. This charge was previously reported as a nonoperating charge in our 2003 Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q. Effective with this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we have reclassified this charge to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The carrying value of our investment in PCE and the fair value of 25 million shares of our common stock, totaling $282 million, have been reflected in current liabilities. The remaining $136 million, representing the net present value of the cash payments, discounted at 5.5%, is recorded in noncurrent liabilities. See Legal Proceedings for a history of this matter. Operating loss We incurred an operating loss of $655 million in 2003 which was significantly lower than the 2002 loss of $2.7 billion and the 2001 operating loss of $6.0 billion. Our loss in 2003 included the asbestos settlement charges. Losses in all three years included restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits as described above. Our results for 2001 were also impacted by an operating charge of $333 million to write down excess and obsolete inventory, a $90 million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of Corning common stock and a $28 million charge to write down an investment in intellectual property. Gain on repurchases and retirement of debt, net During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we repurchased and retired a significant portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures due November 8, 2015. In 2003, we repurchased and retired 1,531,000 debentures with an accreted value of $1.2 billion for cash of approximately $1.1 billion through open market purchases and a public tender offer and recorded a net gain of $55 million. We also issued 6.5 million shares of common stock from treasury in exchange for 55,000 debentures with an accreted value of $43 million, and recognized a charge of $35 million reflecting the fair value of the incremental shares issued beyond those required by the terms of the debentures. The increase in equity due to the issuance of shares from treasury stock was $77 million. The following table summarizes the activity related to our zero coupon convertible debentures (dollars in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 Bonds repurchased or exchanged for equity 1,586,000 638,987 Book value $ 1,239 $ 493 Fair value $ 1,154 $ 308 Pre tax gain (1) $ 20 $ 176 After tax gain (1) $ 13 $ 108 (1) Net of the write off of unamortized issuance and deal costs. In addition to our zero coupon debentures, we repurchased and retired 60,000 euro notes due 2005 with a book value of 60 million euros for cash of 63 million euros (including accrued interest) or $70 million. We recorded a loss of $1 million on the transaction. Benefit for income taxes Our provision (benefit) for income taxes and the related effective benefit rates for continuing operations were as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (254) $ (726) $ (468) Effective benefit rate (33.4)% (26.7)% (7.6)% Our effective tax rate was impacted by our restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits and our gains on repurchases and retirements of debt. Excluding these items, our rate was (33)% in 2003, (30)% in 2002 and (13)% in 2001. SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109")," requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including a companys current, past and future predicted performance, the market environment of the industries in which the company operates, the utilization of past tax credits, length of carryback and carryforward periods, and existing contracts or sales backlog that will result in future profits. At December 31, 2003, we have recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately $2.1 billion with a valuation allowance of $469 million, and offset by deferred tax liabilities of $201 million. The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the realization of specific foreign and state tax benefits, net operating losses and tax credits. The net deferred tax assets of approximately $1.5 billion consist of a combination of domestic (U.S. federal, state and local) and foreign tax benefits for: (a) items which have been recognized for financial reporting purposes, but which will be reported on tax returns to be filed in the future, and (b) loss and tax credit carryforwards. As explained further below, we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized. Net domestic deferred tax assets are approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003. Approximately $460 million of these net deferred tax assets relate to loss and tax credit carryforwards that expire through 2023. The remaining net deferred tax assets comprise the following deductible temporary differences: 1. other postretirement benefits of $244 million, which will reverse over the next 40 to 50 years; 2. restructuring and other liabilities of $155 million, which will reverse over the next 10 years; 3. research and development expenditures of $252 million, which will reverse over the next 10 years; and 4. other miscellaneous items of $178 million, which will reverse, on average, over the next 10 years. Approximately 10% of our net domestic deferred tax assets will be realized through net operating loss carryback claims to be filed over the next three to five years, which will generate cash refunds during such period. We expect the remaining net domestic deferred tax assets to be realized from future earnings. However, in the event future earnings are insufficient, approximately 40% of our net domestic deferred tax assets could be realized through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of a non strategic appreciated asset. Realization of the remaining 50% of our net domestic deferred tax assets is solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during carryforward periods of approximately 20 years. The minimum amount of domestic future income that would have to be generated to realize this portion of our deferred tax assets is $1.7 billion over at least 20 years. Currently, we are generating domestic losses. However, our forecast of domestic income indicates it is more likely than not that the future results of operations in the U.S. will generate sufficient taxable income to realize this portion of our deferred tax assets. Specifically, we expect to incur significantly lower domestic losses in 2004 and to return to profitability in the U.S. in 2005. Key assumptions embedded in these near term forecasts follow: 1. Our 2004 U.S. losses will decrease as a result of the 2003 exit of the photonics technologies business and CAV. 2. We expect to see improved earnings trends in our Telecommunications segment which is primarily in the U.S. This includes a lower loss in 2004 and a return to profitability in 2005. This trend is partially being driven by the realization of lower operating costs as a result of prior years restructuring actions. In addition, we are forecasting revenue to be flat or down slightly in 2004 but significantly higher in 2005 due to an expected recovery in the telecommunications industry in 2005. 3. Our specialty materials semiconductor business will generate higher earnings in 2004 as a result of a recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and lower operating costs as a result of the fourth quarter 2003 restructuring actions, which will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. 4. Our display business will continue its rapid growth. Although this business is largely based in Asia, domestic earnings of this business have increased in 2003 and are expected to continue to increase over the next several years, in part due to an increase in U.S. royalty income. 5. We will continue to sustain modest growth in our remaining domestic businesses and, except for the restructuring actions announced prior to December 31, 2003, we do not expect to incur any significant additional restructuring or impairment charges. Our forecast of domestic income is based on assumptions about and current trends in our operating segments, and there can be no assurance that such results will be achieved. We review such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends quarterly for purpose of our recoverability assessment. As a result of this review, if we determine that we will not return to profitability in the U.S. in 2005 or if sufficient future taxable income may not be generated to fully realize the net deferred tax assets, we will increase the valuation allowance by a charge to income tax expense in an amount equal to the portion of the deferred tax assets that are realizable solely through projected future taxable income. If we record such a valuation allowance, we will also cease to recognize additional tax benefits on any losses in the U.S. Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments Equity earnings nearly doubled to $209 million in 2003. The increase was due to the following: .. The resumption of the recognition of equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2003 added $82 million to equity earnings in 2003. In 1995, we fully impaired our investment in Dow Corning upon its entry into bankruptcy proceedings and did not recognize equity earnings from the second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002. We began recognizing equity earnings in the first quarter of 2003 when we concluded that Dow Cornings emergence from bankruptcy protection was probable based on the Bankruptcy Courts findings on December 11, 2002. See Legal Proceedings for a history of this matter. .. Our 50% owned Samsung Corning Precision, a South Korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass, increased its net income by 82% compared to 2002, resulting in equity earnings $64 million higher than 2002. Earnings in 2003 were $144 million. .. These positive results were negatively impacted by Samsung Corning, which recorded a significant asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2003. Our portion of that charge was $66 million (after tax), which resulted in a net equity loss of $39 million. Equity earnings in 2002 were $116 million, a decline of 22% from 2001, primarily due to the impairment of an equity investment in the second quarter of 2002 for $14 million and a $20 million reduction in equity earnings in the fourth quarter, caused by restructuring and impairment charges recorded by Samsung Corning Micro Optics, a 50% owned manufacturer of photonics components. Excluding these items, equity earnings approximated those in 2001. Loss from continuing operations As a result of the above, the loss from continuing operations and per share data were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Loss from continuing operations $ (223) $ (1,780) $ (5,532) Basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations $ (0.18) $ (1.85) $ (5.93) Shares used in computing basic and diluted per share amounts 1,274 1,030 933 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 13, 2002, we completed the sale of our precision lens business to 3M for cash proceeds up to $850 million, of which $50 million was deposited in an escrow account. During 2002, we received approximately $800 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of $415 million, net of tax, in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. 3M has notified Corning that 3M believes it has certain claims arising out of the representations and warranties made by Corning in connection with the sale of the precision lens business to 3M. The parties are attempting to resolve such claims. In 2003, $1 million of the escrow balance was used to pay state income taxes. At December 31, 2003, approximately $49 million remains in the escrow account, and no other gain on the sale of the precision lens business will be recognized until such claims are resolved. The precision lens business operating results and cash flows have been removed from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented, and have been excluded from the operating segments data. There were no results from discontinued operations in 2003. Summarized selected financial information for the discontinued operations related to the precision lens business follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 Net sales $ 268 $ 225 Income before taxes $ 100 $ 50 Gain on sale before taxes 652 Provision for income taxes (274) (16) Net income $ 478 $ 34 OPERATING SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments consist of Telecommunications and Technologies. We include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. Segment amounts exclude revenues, expenses and equity earnings not specifically identifiable to segments. We prepared the financial results for our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include interest, taxes and corporate functions. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

Telecommunications The Telecommunications segment produces optical fiber and cable, and optical hardware and equipment for the worldwide telecommunications industry. In July 2003, we exited the photonic technologies product line. The following table provides net sales and other data for the Telecommunications segment (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 760 $ 859 $ 2,889 Hardware and equipment 535 552 817 Photonic technologies 54 111 547 Controls and connectors 77 109 205 Total net sales $ 1,426 $ 1,631 $ 4,458 Net loss $ (169) $ (1,897) $ (5,203) 2003 vs. 2002 Sales in the segment declined 13%, or $205 million, compared to 2002. All products in the segment incurred a decline in sales. A portion of the decline was in photonic technologies which we exited in July 2003. The remaining decline in sales was due to price decreases for optical fiber and cable which were partially offset by volume increases. The segment incurred a loss of $169 million in 2003, compared to a net loss of $1.9 billion in the prior year. Restructuring and impairment charges included a $13 million loss on the sale of photonics technologies assets to Avanex and $88 million for restructuring charges offset by credits of $137 million, resulting in net credits of $36 million. All of the Telecommunications products reported a loss in 2003; however, the losses were significantly lower than those incurred in the prior year. The decrease in the loss over the prior year was primarily due to much lower restructuring and impairment charges and cost savings resulting from these actions. The following discussion of products in the Telecommunications segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends. Optical fiber and cable Sales declined 12%, or $99 million compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily due to pricing pressure, particularly in fiber, but was partially offset by strong demand in Japan and China, primarily in the first quarter. Sales volume increased almost 20% in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to having the full year results of the Chinese fiber and cable entities acquired from Lucent in the fourth quarter of 2002. Volumes for our other fiber and cable facilities were up slightly in 2003 compared to 2002. The loss for 2003 was significantly less than 2002 due to significant cost reduction. Hardware and equipment Sales were relatively flat compared to 2002, decreasing 3%, or $17 million. The sales decrease was primarily due to the overall lack of capital spending by our customers impacting the entire telecommunications industry. The loss for 2003 significantly decreased from the prior year due to cost reductions achieved from the 2002 restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives. Photonic technologies On July 31, 2003, we completed the sale of a significant portion of the photonic technologies assets to Avanex. See Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits and Note 5 (Restructuring Actions) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales declined 51%, or $57 million, compared to 2002 due to lower sales volume in the early part of the year as well as our exit of photonics technologies in 2003. The loss in 2003 was more than 85% less than the prior year loss due to cost savings resulting from restructuring actions taken in 2002 as well as the exit of this business in 2003. Controls and connectors Sales decreased 29%, or $32 million in 2003, compared to the prior year. The sales decline for the year was primarily due to the sale of the appliance controls group in May 2002 and the lack of capital spending in the telecommunications industry. The controls and connectors product line incurred a small loss in 2003; however, the loss decreased significantly, compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost savings from restructuring actions taken in 2002. 2002 vs. 2001 This segment incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in 2002 and 2001. The 2002 and 2001 charges are described in detail in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits. The restructuring activities were undertaken to reduce the operating cost structure due to continued market declines. More than half of the 2002 charge related to the impairment of fixed assets, primarily in the fiber and cable business. A significant portion of the asset impairments in this business represented the closure of two fiber plants and permanent abandonment of certain construction projects. The balance of the charge represented impairments of cost based investments, primarily in the photonic technologies business, and severance and benefits for retirees and separated personnel in all businesses. In addition, the segment incurred a $400 million charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $269 million charge for long lived asset impairments in photonic technologies. The impairment charge incurred in the second quarter of 2001 relates to goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in the photonic technologies business. These charges are described in Notes 4 (Impairment of Goodwill) and 6 (Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales in the segment declined 63%, or $2,827 million, compared to 2001 as each product in the segment experienced a significant decline in volume with the largest declines in optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies. The segment incurred losses of $1.9 billion in 2002, compared to a net loss of $5.2 billion in 2001. The 2002 loss was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales volume and restructuring and impairment charges. Each product line reported a loss in 2002. The trend between years reflected lower restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding these restructuring and impairment charges, the segment net loss was $592 million compared to a loss of $81 million in 2001. The increase in the loss in 2002 reflected reduced sales volumes and lower prices in each product line offset by cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions. The following discussion of products in the Telecommunications segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends. Optical fiber and cable Sales declined 70%, or $2,030 million compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a sales volume decline of more than 50% for the year as well as double digit price declines. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, the optical fiber and cable product line incurred a significant loss in 2002, compared to profits in the prior year, primarily due to significantly lower sales volume, declining prices and unfavorable product mix. As discussed in Restructuring Actions, the optical fiber and cable product line undertook significant restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2002. These actions included permanent closure of two international fiber manufacturing plants and the mothballing of the Concord, North Carolina facility. We believe that the Concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within six to nine months of a decision to do so and construction in progress at the Concord facility can be completed efficiently. We believe the Concord and Wilmington plants will provide sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future. Hardware and equipment Sales decreased 32%, or $265 million, compared to 2001. The sales decreases were primarily due to the overall lack of spending impacting the entire telecommunications industry. Excluding restructuring charges, the product line incurred a loss driven by lower volumes and pricing pressure in 2002, compared to a near breakeven performance in 2001. Photonic technologies Sales declined 80%, or $436 million, compared to 2001, primarily due to lower sales volume as network buildouts in the telecommunications industry declined resulting in much lower demand for photonic products. The business incurred a significant loss for 2002 primarily due to dramatically lower sales volumes. However, the 2002 losses decreased more than 50%, compared to the losses incurred in 2001, which included inventory writedowns of $333 million. The results in 2002 reflected cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions taken in 2001 and 2002. During the second quarter of 2002, we favorably resolved an open issue from the second quarter of 2001 with a major customer, resulting in the recognition of revenue of $14 million and pre tax income of $3 million. This revenue was recognized in part on shipment of inventory previously reserved. In addition, we settled an open matter with a significant vendor in 2002 resulting in the reversal of a vendor reserve of $20 million that was recorded as part of the charge in the second quarter of 2001. Controls and connectors Sales decreased 47%, or $96 million, compared to 2001, due to the sale of the appliance controls group in May 2002 and reduced capital spending in the telecommunications industry. Due to lower sales volumes, a loss was incurred for the year compared to earnings in 2001. Outlook: The global telecommunications market downturn that began in 2001 continued into 2003; however, we believe that conditions have begun to stabilize. We ultimately expect a recovery in 2005, and we believe 2004 will be comparable to 2003. We expect 2004 sales to be flat to down slightly compared to 2003. Although we expect to see volumes in our hardware and equipment and fiber and cable businesses to increase, we will continue to experience pricing pressure, but at a lower level than in 2003. We expect a loss in 2004; however, we believe it will be significantly less than 2003, primarily due to the exit of the photonic technologies product line and lower operating expenses reflecting cost savings from restructuring actions taken in 2003 and 2002. Technologies The Technologies segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass, glass ceramic and polymer technologies. Its primary products include liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays, ceramic substrates for automobile and diesel applications, scientific laboratory products, high purity fused silica and other advanced materials used for the manufacture of integrated circuits and glass panels and funnels for televisions and cathode ray tubes. In April 2003, we announced that we had reached agreement with our partner to shutdown CAV. CAV manufactured conventional video components in North America and ceased operations on June 30, 2003. We remain in this market through our equity investment in Samsung Corning. The following table provides net sales and other data for the Technologies segment (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Net sales: Display technologies $ 595 $ 405 $ 323 Environmental technologies 476 394 379 Life sciences 281 280 267 Conventional video components 65 166 252 Other technologies products 224 268 347 Total net sales $ 1,641 $ 1,513 $ 1,568 Net income $ 112 $ 119 $ 92 2003 vs. 2002 Sales in the Technologies segment increased 8%, or $128 million, compared to 2002. Increased sales in display technologies and environmental technologies were partially offset by much lower sales in conventional video components that we exited and lower sales in other technologies products. Segment earnings for 2003 were down 6% compared to the prior year. Improved operating performance from display technologies and environmental technologies were partially offset by the shutdown of CAV and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials product line. Segment net income for 2003 included net restructuring, impairment and accelerated depreciation charges of $134 million primarily for the exit of CAV and the consolidation of our semiconductor manufacturing sites, and a $66 million charge to equity earnings of Samsung Corning resulting from an asset impairment charge compared to net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $150 million in 2002. See Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits and Note 5 (Restructuring Actions) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion of products in the Technologies segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends. Display technologies Sales increased 47%, or $190 million, compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to volume gains of approximately 43%, as penetration of liquid crystal display panels in the desktop market increased, and favorable exchange rates. Earnings doubled in 2003 compared to the prior year due to the increase in volume and significant gains in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision over the prior year. In July 2003, we announced an $180 million expansion of our liquid crystal display glass manufacturing facility in Taiwan. The three phased project is expected to be completed by the end of 2004 with production to begin in the second quarter of 2004. In February 2004, we announced a $600 million expansion of our liquid crystal display glass manufacturing facility in Japan and Taiwan. This expansion will occur over 2004 and 2005. Environmental technologies Sales increased 21%, or $82 million, compared to 2002. The increased sales were primarily due to increased U.S. auto production driven by financing incentives, favorable mix of premium products, favorable exchange rates and higher sales for diesel products. Earnings decreased more than 38% compared to the prior year due to a decrease in equity earnings from Cormetech, a U.S. designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts, and higher development spending for the diesel product line. Life sciences Sales were flat in 2003, compared to 2002, primarily due to weak sales in Europe and a general softness in the market. Earnings were flat compared to the prior year, primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and a gain on the disposition of a minor product line that was more than offset by higher development spending. Conventional video components Sales decreased 61%, or $101 million, compared to 2002. The sales declines are due to loss of volume, price declines and our decision to exit CAV. As discussed earlier, we ceased operations in the second quarter of 2003. See Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits and Note 5 (Restructuring Actions) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The loss increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased sales volume, continued competitive pricing pressures and equity losses from Samsung Corning. Although Samsung Corning generates cash, we expect that our equity earnings from this venture will be lower than historical levels going forward. Further, it is possible that future equity results may include operating losses or significant restructuring or fixed asset impairment charges recorded by Samsung Corning. Our investment in Samsung Corning was $320 million at December 31, 2003. Other technologies products Sales in our other technologies businesses, including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products, decreased 16%, or $44 million, compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume of high purity fused silica products, as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at relatively low levels, and the exit of the lighting product line in September 2002. The losses from other technologies products more than tripled, compared to the prior year. The losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium fluoride products. Due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor equipment market, we are consolidating the semiconductor materials manufacturing facilities to attain greater flexibility than we have in our current cost structure. As a result, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges and accelerated depreciation as discussed in Restructuring Actions and Note 5 (Restructuring Actions) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2002 vs. 2001 Sales in the Technologies segment during 2002 decreased 4%, or $55 million, compared to 2001, as increased sales in display technologies, environmental technologies and life sciences were offset by much lower sales in the mature conventional video components product line, decreased demand for semiconductor materials and the impact of Cornings exit of its lighting products line in 2002. Segment earnings increased 29%, or $27 million, compared to 2001, as improved operating performance in display technologies and life sciences and stronger equity earnings were partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials and conventional video components products. The 2002 restructuring costs recorded in this segment consisted entirely of severance and benefits for retired and separated employees in several businesses. The impairment charges related to assets held for use. See Impairment of Long Lived Assets Other than Goodwill. The following discussion of products in the Technologies segment excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and credits to provide clarity on the underlying business trends. Display technologies Sales increased 25%, or $82 million, compared to 2001. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume as penetration in the desktop market increased. The prior years sales were negatively impacted by an inventory correction in the industry in the first quarter of 2001. Volume gains of over 46% for 2002 were partially offset by price declines of 10% on a constant currency basis. Earnings increased over 30% in 2002, compared to 2001, primarily due to volume gains and a more than 30% improvement in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision. Environmental technologies Sales increased 4%, or $15 million, compared to 2001, primarily due to increased U.S. auto production driven by financing incentives and strong growth in Europe and Japan. Earnings improved 8%, compared to 2001, as a significant increase in equity earnings from Cormetech, a U.S. designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts, was partially offset by price declines and increased manufacturing and development costs related to new products. Life sciences Sales increased 5%, or $13 million, compared to 2001, primarily due to strong growth in most product lines. Earnings more than doubled over 2001, primarily due to cost savings from the discontinuation of our investment in microarray technology products in the third quarter of 2001, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher sales. Conventional video components Sales decreased 34%, or $86 million, compared to 2001. Pricing pressure was strong in this market due to increased competition. A significant portion of CAVs business was concentrated with few customers, two of which merged. The loss increased almost 50% for the year, compared to 2001, primarily due to decreased sales volume and continued competitive pricing pressures. Samsung Corning also experienced pricing pressure resulting in an approximate 10% decline in equity earnings for 2002, compared to the prior year. Other technologies products Sales decreased 23%, or $79 million, compared to 2001. The decrease was led by the exit of the lighting product line and lower sales volume of high purity fused silica products as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at relatively low levels. Other technologies products incurred a loss for the year compared to break even results in 2001. The losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium fluoride products. Outlook: We expect sales in the Technologies segment to increase in 2004, primarily due to continued growth in our display technologies product line and increased sales of diesel products. All products in this segment expect improved revenue in 2004. We also expect profitability in the segment to improve significantly in 2004 due to the strong volume growth in display technologies and increased equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision. NON SEGMENT RESULTS Our non segment results include the operations of Steuben, a crystal glass manufacturer, and equity earnings from nonstrategic investments that are not aligned with our two operating segments. In addition, the results of operating segments do not include amortization of goodwill, gain on repurchases and retirement of debt, charges related to the asbestos litigation and restructuring and impairment charges related to the corporate research and development or staff organizations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing Structure In 2003, we completed two equity offerings of our common stock as follows: .. 45 million shares in July for net proceeds of $363 million, and .. 50 million shares in May for net proceeds of $267 million. We used the net proceeds of the May offering and $356 million of existing cash to reduce debt through a public tender offer conducted in June. We used the net proceeds of the July offering to reduce debt through open market repurchases. See Note 17 (Shareholders Equity) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We repurchased and retired approximately 1.6 million zero coupon convertible debentures in 2003 for approximately $1.1 billion in cash and 6.5 million shares of treasury common stock. See Note 14 (Long Term Debt and Loans Payable) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. As a result of our debt repurchase program, we reduced the balance of zero coupon convertible debentures as follows: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Zero coupon convertibles $ 385 $ 1,606 $ 2,059 The remaining zero coupon convertible debentures will likely be put back to us on November 8, 2005, at $819.54 per debenture and on November 8, 2010, at $905.29 per debenture. We have the option of settling this obligation in cash, common stock, or a combination of both. From time to time, we may retire additional debt securities for cash or equity. Due to our debt ratings, we continue to be precluded from accessing the short term commercial paper market. The terms that we could receive on any new long term debt issues would likely be consistent with those generally available to high yield issuers. As an additional source of funds, we currently have full unrestricted access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility with 17 banks, expiring on August 17, 2005. As of December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. The facility includes one financial covenant limiting the ratio of total debt to total capital, as defined, to not greater than 60%. At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, this ratio was 34% and 47%, respectively. In March 2001, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC that became effective in the first quarter of 2001. The shelf permits the issuance of up to $5 billion of various debt and equity securities. As of March 1, 2004, our remaining capacity under the shelf registration statement was approximately $2.9 billion. Subsequent Event Through March 1, 2004, we repurchased and retired 25 thousand zero coupon convertible debentures for approximately $19 million in cash resulting in a net decrease of $20 million to the zero coupon convertible debenture book value. In addition, we issued 22 million shares of Corning common stock and $24 million in cash in exchange for 3.5% convertible debentures with a book value of $213 million at an effective conversion price of $9.675 per share. As a result of these transactions, we will record a $23 million pre tax loss on repurchases and retirement of debt during the first quarter of 2004. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $366 million, $357 million and $1.7 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our 2004 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million, of which $425 million to $475 million will be to expand the capacity for liquid crystal display glass. Capital spending activity in 2002 and 2003 primarily included expansion of liquid crystal display capacity and new capacity for diesel substrates. Capital spending in 2001 related primarily to the Telecommunications segment. Restructuring During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we made payments of $233 million, $278 million and $77 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Cash payments for employee related costs and other exit costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2004, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2005. Key Balance Sheet Data At December 31, 2003, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.3 billion, compared with $2.1 billion at December 31, 2002. The decrease from December 31, 2002, was primarily due to long term debt repayments, restructuring payments, capital expenditures and the use for working capital. These items were partially offset by the proceeds from the May and July equity offerings and the receipt of a U.S. federal tax refund of $191 million. Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): As of December 31, 2003 2002 Working capital $1,141 $2,145 Working capital, excluding cash and short term investments $(125) $ 55 Current ratio 1.7:1 2.3:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 525 $ 470 Days sales outstanding 58 56 Inventories $ 467 $ 559 Inventory turns 4.8 4.4 Days payable outstanding 52 46 Long term debt $2,668 $3,963 Total debt to total capital 34% 47% Credit Ratings As of March 1, 2004, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Rating Outlook Last Update Long Term Debt Commercial Paper Last Update Standard & Poors BB+ B Stable July 29, 2002 January 16, 2004 Moodys Ba2 Not Prime Stable July 29, 2002 November 19, 2003 Fitch BB B Stable July 24, 2002 July 24, 2003 Our 2003 earnings were not adequate to cover our fixed charges (principally interest and related charges on debt), primarily as a result of the asbestos settlement charge, losses incurred in the Telecommunications segment and restructuring and impairment charges. We expect our full year 2004 earnings will be sufficient to cover our fixed charges. Management Assessment of Liquidity Our major source of funding for 2004 and beyond will be our existing balance of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. From time to time we may also issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, restructuring, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. We may accelerate some or all of the funding of the cash payments to the asbestos settlement trust, as needed, to maximize the tax benefits we can realize in connection with the related settlement charges. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have two variable interest entities ("VIEs") that are not consolidated as we are not the primarily beneficiary. The assets and debt of these entities total $12 million. Our maximum loss exposure as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is approximately $18 million. This amount represents payments that would be due to the lessor in the event of a total loss of the assets. We carry insurance coverage for this risk. Contractual Obligations Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 5 years and (In millions) Total 1 year years years years thereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 170 $ 31 $ 2 $ 1 $ 136 Contingent purchase price for acquisitions 36 36 Dow Corning credit facility 150 150 Stand by letters of credit 16 6 10 Loan guarantees 25 4 21 Purchase obligations (1) 48 15 14 11 $ 8 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 59 59 Total debt (3) 2,827 146 590 46 113 1,932 Minimum rental commitments 300 44 33 29 39 155 Total other commercial commitments and contingencies $ 3,631 $ 337 $ 643 $ 87 $ 160 $ 2,404 (1) Balance primarily represents obligations associated with a take or pay contract related to our hardware and equipment operations. (2) Capital expenditure obligations primarily related to our display technologies product line expansions, which are included on our balance sheet. (3) At December 31, 2003, $2,814 million of the $2,827 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value. We have provided other financial guarantees and have contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments for acquisitions, stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning as discussed in Note 10 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. In January 2003, the SEC released FR 67, "Disclosure in Managements Discussion and Analysis about Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations". In response to this guidance, we have assessed our off balance sheet and contractual obligations and have determined that in addition to previously disclosed items, purchase obligations would be added. Given the nature of purchase obligations, we limited our assessment to individual items outstanding at December 31, 2003 greater than $1 million. Pensions We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2003, this plan accounted for 82% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 89% of the related plans assets. In 2002, global capital market developments resulted in negative returns on plan assets and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the related pension liability. In 2003, although global equities had positive returns, interest rates continued to decline. As a result, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets, which required Corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." Balances of these non cash adjustments follow (in millions): December 31, 2003 2002 Minimum pension liability $ 311 $ 348 Intangible assets 52 68 Other accumulated comprehensive loss, pre tax 259 280 Other accumulated comprehensive loss, after tax 159 173 We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan at least until 2006. We contributed $160 million in 2003 to our U.S. pension plan. For 2004, we anticipate making voluntary contributions of at least $40 million to this plan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of goodwill SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires us to make certain difficult, subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and the definition of our reporting units. We measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. The criteria for establishing a reporting unit is dependent upon how a company determines its operating segments under SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." Specifically, SFAS No. 142 permits a company to define a reporting unit as either an operating segment, a component of an operating segment or an aggregation of two or more components of an operating segment. The reporting unit for the Telecommunications segment goodwill is the Telecommunications operating segment. The reporting units for the Technologies segment are components of the Technologies segment. At December 31, 2003, the Telecommunications and Technologies operating segment goodwill balances were $1.6 billion and $159 million, respectively. During 2002, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test, determined the Telecommunications goodwill balance was impaired, and recorded a related impairment charge of $400 million. Our 2002 testing results also determined that the Technologies segment goodwill was not impaired. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests and determined that the goodwill balances were not impaired. As discussed in more detail below, while we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur. We are currently in discussion with the staff of the SEC on the determination of our operating segments. We believe that our determination of our operating segments under SFAS No. 131 is appropriate. However, it is possible that the outcome of this discussion could be a revision of how we define and disclose our operating segments. It is also possible that a change in how we define our Telecommunications operating segment could impact our goodwill impairment tests under SFAS No. 142. Specifically, we could be required to record a net additional goodwill impairment charge of up to $600 million (pre tax) in 2002. Although this potential charge would increase our 2002 net loss, it would not impact our 2002 operating cash flows because goodwill impairments are noncash charges. Our debt to capital ratio ranged from 44% to 47% throughout 2002. This potential charge would have increased our debt to capital ratio to no higher than 51%, which would still be below the 60% financial covenant limit relating to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The potential 2002 goodwill impairment charge would have no impact on operating results or operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2003. Telecommunications Our expectation is that there will be minimal volume growth in the short term; volume growth is assumed to accelerate beginning in 2005 commensurate with overall market recovery. Terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. These cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill. The discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of eleven public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. For our 2002 annual test, we used a discount rate of 12% in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows. An impairment charge of $400 million was recorded in 2002. Had we used a discount rate of 11.5%, the fair value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its carrying value, and there would not have been impairment. Had we used a discount rate of 12.5%, the pre tax impairment charge would have been approximately $225 million higher. In 2003, we also used a 12% discount rate for our annual impairment test. The results of our test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 11.5% or 12.5%. Technologies Due to market conditions, we determined that a detailed impairment test of the specialty materials reporting unit was required in the fourth quarter of 2003. While there was a significant decrease in sales in 2003 in this reporting unit due to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, we expect increased volume growth beginning in 2004. Our discounted cash flow test for this reporting unit assumes a perpetuity growth rate of 3%. The discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows represents weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of eight public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. We used a discount rate of 12% in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows. The results of our test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 11.5% or 12.5%. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We concluded events of impairment had occurred in our semiconductor materials product line, which is part of the specialty materials business, in the fourth quarter of 2003, and performed an impairment test. The results of our test indicated that our long lived assets held for use were not impaired. In 2002, we recorded pre tax charges totaling $409 million primarily related to the photonics and conventional television product lines. In each circumstance, behavior of external parties, including customers and competitors, were considered in the determination of whether an impairment was required. We also exercised judgment in the determination of expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated. For the impairment in 2002, we exercised judgment in determining the fair value of the assets from which the impairment charge was measured. For our photonic technologies products, we based the fair value of our long lived assets on the actual results of recent asset auctions of similar equipment. For the assets related to our conventional television product line, we exercised judgment about alternative volume and sales price scenarios, computed discounted cash flows, and assigned our best estimate of probability to each alternative. We reduced the useful lives of the fixed assets of CAV as a result of this assessment. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions During 2003 and 2002, we recorded write downs of property, plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. Assets impaired were primarily equipment, construction in progress and buildings, which were sold or abandoned. We used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment. The estimated salvage values were very low, primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment. The salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold. We have had significant reversals in 2003, and it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves. Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2003, Corning had gross deferred tax assets of $2.1 billion. We determined that the likelihood of realization of certain deferred tax assets is less than 50% and recorded valuation allowances of $469 million. If future taxable income differs from our estimate, adjustments to these allowances will be required and will impact future net income. See Income Taxes and Note 9 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter, as well as known outcomes in case law. See Legal Proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the PCC asbestos liability. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending ourself against asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives, and other factors. We have reached a tentative settlement on PCC as disclosed in Legal Proceedings and Note 10 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies, including a favorable vote by 75% of the asbestos claimants voting on the PCC Plan, and approval by the bankruptcy court. Pension assumptions In 2002, we made a change in assumption that impacted pension expense in future periods. Specifically, we lowered our expected long term rate of return on pension assets from 9% to 8.5%. We did not alter the nature of the pension trust investments. Asset performance in 2002 had been below the 9% assumption. As such, we lowered our long term rate of return assumption. In 2003, this increased our pension expense as measured in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pension," compared to amounts recorded in 2002. The increase was approximately $8 million in 2003. In 2003, our actual return on plan assets approximated 20%; however, we will continue to hold our expected long term rate of return at 8.5%. ENVIRONMENT We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for twelve active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. We have accrued approximately $21 million for our estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at December 31, 2003. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a revised SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." The revised standard requires incremental pension and other postretirement benefit plan disclosures to financial statements and is designed to improve disclosure transparency. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have any effect on our results of operations or financial position. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51," ("FIN 46") which requires all VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the VIE. In addition, the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both VIEs that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is the holder of a significant, but not the majority amount of the beneficial interests. We have leased equipment from three VIEs for which the sole purpose is the leasing of equipment to us. We assessed the impact of this interpretation and determined that we are the primary beneficiary of one of these existing VIEs, and therefore, began to consolidate this entity beginning on July 1, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the assets and debt of this entity were $31 million and $34 million, respectively. We also evaluated the impact of this interpretation on the two other entities and determined that we are not the primary beneficiary for either entity. The assets and debt of these entities total $12 million. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, we adopted the following new standards in 2003, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations: .. SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," .. SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," .. FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"), .. SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and .. SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the SEC on Forms 10 Q and 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions; tariffs, import duties and currency fluctuations; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; sufficiency of manufacturing capacity and efficiencies; cost reductions; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers in the liquid crystal display industry and other business segments; changes in the mix of sales between premium and non premium products; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or major health concerns; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; capital resource and cash flow activities; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand, which may fluctuate; equity company activities; interest costs; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; and stock price fluctuations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rate effects includes: .. exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and .. exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and western European countries. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Equity in earnings of associated companies has historically contributed a significant amount of our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments was $209 million in 2003 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 50% of this amount. Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $105 million in equity earnings for 2003. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2003, we had open forward contracts, open option contracts, foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2003. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $116 million. The nature of our foreign exchange rate risk exposures has not changed materially from December 31, 2002. Interest Rate Risk Management In March and April of 2002, we entered into three interest rate swaps that are fair value hedges and economically exchanged a notional amount of $275 million of fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the six month LIBOR rate and receive the fixed rates of 8.3% to 8.875%, which are the stated interest rates on the long term debt instruments. As a result of these transactions, Corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. The interest rate on these instruments is reset every six months, and they expire in 14 to 23 years. In September 2003, we terminated two of the interest rate swap agreements described above with a notional amount of $150 million. The termination of these swaps resulted in a $15 million gain which we will amortize to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. The cash proceeds from the termination of the swap agreement totaled $17 million and is included in the financing section of our consolidated cash flow statement. As of December 31, 2003, we have one remaining swap agreement in effect with a notional amount of $125 million. It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our policy sets a maximum cap that total variable rate debt will not exceed 35% of the total debt portfolio at anytime. At December 31, 2003, our consolidated debt portfolio contained approximately 6% of variable rate instruments.
