Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We continued to focus on three significant priorities in 2004: protect our financial health, improve profitability, and invest in our future. We made significant progress towards all three in 2004. Financial Health During 2004, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and delivered positive cash flows for the year. The following are key accomplishments for 2004: .. As part of a debt reduction program, we retired $487 million of long term debt. Additionally, we repaid $115 million of debt, primarily attributable to certain bondholders exercising their early repayment option. .. We issued $400 million of long term debt, the proceeds of which will be used to repay debt, fund capital expenditures and extend the duration of our debt portfolio. .. We reduced our DSOs to 52 days, compared to 58 days as of December 31, 2003. This was accomplished through the negotiation of improved payment terms with customers, primarily in the Display Technologies segment. .. Negotiated multi year supply agreements with customers in the Display Technologies segment, including the receipt of deposits against orders, to meet the rapid growth of the liquid crystal display (LCD) market. During 2004, we received deposits totaling $204 million under such agreements. .. We generated sufficient cash flows from operating activities to cover our capital expenditures. We ended 2004 with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. This represents an increase of $615 million from December 31, 2003. We continue to have unrestricted access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility, and have $2.5 billion of capacity under our existing universal shelf registration statement. Our revolving credit facility expires in August 2005. We are currently in negotiations with leading financial institutions to arrange a credit facility, and believe a new facility will be executed in the first half of 2005. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. Profitability Although 2004 resulted in a net loss of $2,165 million, this included a number of charges that are not anticipated to recur in the future, and is therefore not indicative of our projections for profitability in 2005. The most significant charges included in our net loss were: .. Goodwill and asset impairment charges of $1,746 million, primarily in our Telecommunications segment. .. An increase in our provision for income taxes of $937 million caused by our decision to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. The goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges were triggered from the results of our annual strategic planning process of the Telecommunications segment. Specifically, we determined that we needed to lower our estimates and forecasts for the long term revenue growth of the Telecommunications segment. Although we are currently experiencing stronger than expected volume in this segment, the improved demand comes from a narrow band of customers, and we see few signs of a broader recovery in overall demand, mix of premium products, and pricing for our products. The lack of industry consolidation, increased competitive pressures in the industry, and revised estimates of future customer demand for the types of products they will deploy have caused us to change our assessment of the future pace of recovery. The primary estimates and forecasts driving this change in our outlook are: .. Revised estimates of future pricing for fiber and cable: Pricing in the telecommunications industry remains depressed as the industry has failed to reduce capacity. Our previous projections assumed some rationalization of capacity that would lead to more stable pricing. We now expect the current depressed pricing conditions to persist into 2005 and beyond. .. Revised estimates of demand for premium fiber product: Based on competitive conditions and projected future customer requirements, we do not expect to achieve the level of demand for premium fiber products we previously forecasted. Although we have introduced innovative products to the market, we have not been able to obtain the historical premium prices for such products. Additionally, demand for premium fiber has declined as there are fewer long haul projects. As a result, we have significantly reduced our outlook for future revenue and profitability from premium products. We now do not expect any significant increase in premium fiber mix for the foreseeable future. .. Revised estimates for the long term worldwide market volume growth: As we project customer demand, we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the longer range. As a result of the impairment charges and lower long term outlook for our Telecommunication segment, we have also concluded that we must provide a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). The valuation allowance relates to our domestic (U.S. federal, state and local) and German deferred tax assets. We have incurred significant losses in the U.S. and Germany due primarily to the Telecommunications restructuring and impairment charges and operating losses over the last four years. Although Cornings profitability has improved over the last several quarters, a growing portion of our sales and earnings is outside of the U.S., particularly in Asia. The U.S. portion of our operations operated at a loss in 2004. This portion not only includes most of our Telecommunications segment, but also a significant portion of our global research, development and engineering and corporate infrastructure spending. As we have taken additional significant impairment charges and lowered our outlook for our largest U.S. based business during the third quarter, we believe that a valuation allowance against these tax assets is required until realization is more assured. We remain committed to return to profitability in the U.S. and Germany so that we will be able to use these deferred tax assets before they expire. In general, U.S. tax laws allow 20 years to use operating loss carryforwards. The above charges more than offset the significant earnings growth in our Display Technologies segment and the gross margin improvements resulting from restructuring actions taken in 2003, most notably the exit of the conventional television and photonics businesses. We remain confident in our ability to execute our plans and return to profitability in 2005. Investing in our future We remain committed to investing in innovation. We are investing in a wide variety of technologies with our focus being glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises. Our research, development and engineering expenditures have moderately increased compared to 2003. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our growth strategies. We also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses. Our capital expenditures are primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment and diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Total capital expenditures for 2004 were $857 million, of which $640 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $124 million in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems. We expect our 2005 capital spending to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, of which $900 million to $1.1 billion will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment and approximately $140 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): % Change 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 Net sales $ 3,854 $ 3,090 $ 3,164 25 (2) Gross margin $ 1,415 $ 849 $ 602 67 41 (gross margin %) 37% 27% 19% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 653 $ 599 $ 716 9 (16) (as a % of revenues) 17% 19% 23% Research, development and engineering expenses $ 355 $ 344 $ 483 3 (29) (as a % of revenues) 9% 11% 15% Restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) $ 1,789 $ 111 $ 2,080 1,512 (95) (as a % of revenues) 46% 4% 66% Asbestos settlement $ 33 $ 413 (92) (as a % of revenues) 1% 13% Loss from continuing operations before income taxes $ (1,580) $ (759) $(2,720) 108 (72) (as a % of revenues) (41)% (25)% (86)% (Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (1,031) $ 254 $ 726 (506) (65) (as a % of revenues) (27)% (8)% (23)% Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments $ 443 $ 209 $ 116 112 80 (as a % of revenues) 11% 7% 4% Loss from continuing operations $ (2,185) $ (223) $(1,780) 880 (87) (as a % of revenues) (57)% (7)% (56)% Net Sales The net sales increase in 2004 was the result of strong demand for glass substrates in our Display Technologies segment, demand for hardware and equipment products in our Telecommunications segment, and improvements across the majority of our other businesses. These improvements were partially offset by the 2003 exit of our photonic technologies and U.S. conventional television glass businesses. Movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen and Euro, did not significantly impact the comparison of net sales between 2004 and 2003. The net sales decline in 2003 was primarily due to the exit of the photonic technologies and U.S. conventional television glass businesses during 2003. Based on the exchange rates at the beginning of 2003, our sales were favorably impacted by the weakening U.S. dollar against the Yen and the Euro by approximately 3%. Reflecting the growth in our Display Technologies segment, net sales into international markets are increasing at a faster rate than those into the U.S. market. For 2004, sales into international markets accounted for 65% of net sales while sales to the U.S. market accounted for 35%. For 2003, sales to international markets accounted for 60% of net sales while sales to the U.S. market for 40%. Gross Margin As a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved 10 points in 2004. The improvement in overall gross margin dollars and as a percentage of net sales was driven by (a) net sales growth in the Display Technologies segment of 87%, (b) operating efficiencies in our Telecommunications segment and (c) the 2003 exit of the conventional television glass business. For 2003, gross margins improved eight points. This improvement was primarily the result of lower costs resulting from our 2002 restructuring programs, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. Gross margin improved in all other reportable segments; however, the gains achieved were partially offset by a $13 million write down of inventory related to the exit of the U.S. conventional television business. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The 2004 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increases in compensation costs. For 2003, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses reflects cost savings primarily from the 2003 and 2002 restructuring actions. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenditures increased modestly in 2004, but the focus of our spending has shifted from Telecommunications projects to Display Technologies projects. Expenditures on Environmental Technologies projects have remained relatively constant and spending on Life Sciences projects has increased $10 million. The 2003 decrease reflects the cost savings that resulted from the 2002 restructuring actions, including the closure and consolidation of research facilities. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded significant net charges in 2004, 2003 and 2002. These charges are summarized in the following table (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Impairment of goodwill $ 1,420 $ 400 Impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment 302 $ 41 701 Assets to be held and used 24 409 Accelerated Depreciation 37 12 Loss on sale of businesses 12 13 16 Impairment of cost investments 4 107 Restructuring charges and (credits) (6) 41 447 Total restructuring, impairment other charges and (credits) $ 1,789 $ 111 $ 2,080 Impairment of Goodwill 2004 Impairment Charge Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," (SFAS 142) goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level. In addition, goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value. Our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process that runs from June to October. This process includes reviewing expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows. In the third quarter, we identified certain factors during this annual strategic planning process that caused us to lower our estimates and projections for the long term revenue growth of the Telecommunications segment, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Telecommunications segment reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As such, we performed an interim impairment test of the Telecommunications segment goodwill in the third quarter of 2004, the results of which were reviewed with Cornings board of directors on October 6, 2004. We estimated the fair value of the Telecommunications segment using a discounted cash flow model based on our current estimates for the long term growth of the Telecommunications segment, and concluded that the fair value of the Telecommunications segment was below its carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,420 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value. We updated our Telecommunications segment goodwill test in the fourth quarter. The result of the test concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value. 2002 Impairment Charge In the fourth quarter of 2002, we conducted our annual impairment tests and concluded that an impairment charge of $400 million was necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the Telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of $1.6 billion. The decrease in fair value at the end of 2002 from that measured in the initial benchmark assessment on January 1, 2002 primarily reflected the following: . a delay in the timing of the expected recovery from late 2002, or early 2003 to 2005, . a reduction in the short term cash flow expectations of the fiber and cable business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will occur, and . a reduction in the short and long term cash flow expectations of the photonic technologies product line. We retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of our tangible and identifiable intangible assets for the purpose of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at December 31, 2002. Impairment Of Long Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill Given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing our businesses, at various times throughout 2002 to 2004, we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our held for use long lived assets other than goodwill. In each case that an impairment evaluation was required, we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated. If our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows, we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets, which were limited to property, plant and equipment, using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. 2004 Impairment Charge Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment These charges comprise the following: . Telecommunications segment: In 2004, we recorded a net charge of $344 million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to be disposed of or shutdown. Approximately $332 million of this net charge is comprised of the partially completed sections of our Concord, N.C. optical fiber facility. As a result of our lowered outlook, we have permanently abandoned this construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the investment necessary to complete this facility. Corning will continue to mothball and depreciate the separate previously operated portion of the Concord fiber facility. . Other businesses: We recorded net credits of $42 million, primarily for gains on the sale of assets of Corning Asahi Video Products Company (CAV) sold to a third party in China. This represented proceeds in excess of assumed salvage values for assets previously impaired. In July 2004, we completed the sale of CAVs assets. Assets to be held and used Due to our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our long term outlook for the Telecommunications segment during the third quarter of 2004, we determined that an event of impairment had occurred in our Telecommunications segment which required us to test the segments long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment. As a result of this impairment evaluation, we recorded a $24 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2004 to write down certain assets to fair value. 2003 Impairment Charge Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment These charges comprise the following: . Telecommunications segment: We recorded charges of $24 million to impair plant and equipment related to the shutdown of a cabling plant and the final exit of the photonic technologies business. The charges were more than offset by a $61 million credit related to previous restructuring plans, primarily the result of decision not to exit two of the cable sites previously marked for shutdown in 2002. . Other businesses: We recorded charges of $78 million, primarily related to our decision to shutdown CAV, and the closure of our North Brookfield semiconductor materials plant. 2002 Impairment Charges Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment In 2002, in connection with the restructuring actions we recorded a net charge of $701 million related to facilities to be shut down or dispose of, and the abandonment of certain construction projects. These net charges were primarily related to the Telecommunications segment and certain research facilities. Assets to be held and used These charges comprise the following: . Telecommunications segment: In 2002, the telecommunications market underwent a dramatic decline in demand for its products as major buyers of network equipment in this industry reduced their capital spending. As a result of our impairment evaluation, the photonics assets were written down to estimated salvage value, as this amount was our best estimate of fair value. This resulted in a $269 million write down of the long lived assets including $90 million related to patents. . Other businesses: In 2002, the market was impacted by a decline in demand for conventional television glass and a dramatic increase in the importation of television glass, tubes and sets from Asia. As a result of our impairment evaluation, CAVs assets were written down to their estimated fair values. This resulted in a $140 million write down of the assets. Accelerated Depreciation 2004 Accelerated Depreciation We recorded $37 million of accelerated depreciation relating to the final shutdown of our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2003. 2003 Accelerated Depreciation We recorded $12 million of accelerated depreciation as a result of our decision to shutdown our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in Charleston, South Carolina by March 31, 2004. Loss on Sale of Businesses 2004 Loss on Sale of Business On September 1, 2004 we completed the sale of our frequency controls business, which was part of the Telecommunications segment, for net cash proceeds of $80 million. We recorded a loss on the sale of $14 million, which included an allocation of $30 million of the Telecommunications segment goodwill. The frequency controls business had 2003 annual sales of $76 million. 2003 Loss on Sale of Business In the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a $13 million loss on the sale of a significant portion of our photonic technologies business, which was part of our Telecommunications segment. 2002 Loss on Sale of Business We recorded a loss of $16 million upon the sale of a portion of the controls and connectors product line, which was part of the Telecommunications segment. Impairment of Cost Investments 2003 Impairment Charge In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a $5 million charge for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the Telecommunications segment. In the third quarter of 2003, we sold these investments for $4 million in cash, which was $1 million more than previously expected. We reported this gain as a credit to restructuring actions. 2002 Impairment Charge We impaired cost based investments in a number of private telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of 2002 to divest the portfolio. As a result of this decision, we recorded a charge of $107 million. Restructuring Actions 2004 Restructuring Actions There were no significant restructuring actions taken during 2004, nor were there any significant revisions to estimates used in prior year restructuring plans. 2003 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $41 million in 2003. Major actions approved and initiated in 2003 included the following: . The shutdown of CAV. . The exit of our photonics products within the Telecommunications segment. . Credits to prior year restructuring plans, primarily the result of our decision not to exit two small cabling sites previously marked for shutdown in 2002. . The shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing facilities in North Brookfield and Charleston, South Carolina. 2002 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $447 million in 2002. Major actions approved and initiated in 2002 included the following: . Permanent closure of our optical fiber manufacturing facilities in Noble Park, Victoria, Australia, and Neustadt bei Coburg, Germany. We also mothballed our optical fiber manufacturing facility in Concord, North Carolina and transferred certain capabilities to our Wilmington, North Carolina facility. . Reductions in capacity and employment in our cabling and hardware and equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs. . Permanent closure of our photonic technologies thin film filter manufacturing facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts. . Permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in 2001 in the fiber and cable business within the Telecommunications segment. . Closure of minor manufacturing facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. . Closure and consolidation of research facilities. . Elimination of positions worldwide through voluntary and involuntary programs. Asbestos settlement On March 28, 2003, we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future non premises asbestos claims against us and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC), which might arise from PCC products or operations. The agreement is expected to be incorporated into a settlement fund as part of a reorganization plan for PCC. The plan was submitted to the federal bankruptcy court at the end of 2003, received a favorable vote from creditor classes in the first quarter of 2004, but remains subject to a number of contingencies. The Bankruptcy Court has allowed an additional round of briefing to address current case law developments, with briefs due on February 28, 2005 and March 10, 2005, leading to a hearing on March 16, 2005. The timing and outcome of these proceedings are uncertain. If the Bankruptcy Court does not confirm the PCC Plan in its current form, changes to the settlement agreement are reasonably possible. Further judicial review is also reasonably possible. Our contributions to the settlement trust under the agreement are not required unless the plan is approved, becomes effective and is no longer subject to appeal. If the plan becomes effective, our settlement will require the contribution of our equity interest in PCC, our one half equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), and 25 million shares of our common stock. The common stock will be marked to market each quarter until it is contributed to the settlement trust, thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate. We will also make cash payments with a current value of $144 million over six years beginning one year after the plan becomes effective. In addition, we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement. The following summarizes the charges we have recorded for the asbestos settlement (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 Initial settlement charge $ 298 Mark to market common stock $ 33 115 Asbestos settlement $ 33 $ 413 See Legal Proceedings for a history of this matter. Loss From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes In addition to the drivers identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) and Asbestos Settlement, we also retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during 2004, 2003 and 2002 that resulted in the following (losses) gains on these transactions for the respective periods (in millions): Book Value of Cash Shares Debentures Retired Paid Issued Gain (Loss) 2004 activity: Convertible debentures, 3.5%, due 2008 $ 368 $ 37 38 $ (36) Zero coupon convertible debentures, 2%, due 2015 119 117 Total 2004 activity $ 487 $ 154 38 $ (36) 2003 activity: Zero coupon convertible debentures, 2%, due 2015 $ 1,239 $ 1,121 6 $ 20 Euro notes, 5.625%, due 2005 67 68 (1) Total 2003 activity $ 1,306 $ 1,189 6 $ 19 2002 activity: Zero coupon convertible debentures, 2%, due 2015 $ 493 $ 308 $ 175 Euro notes, 5.625%, due 2005 1 1 1 Total 2002 activity $ 494 $ 309 $ 176 (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes Our (provision) benefit for income taxes and the related effective (income tax) benefit rates were as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (1,031) $ 254 $ 726 Effective (income tax) benefit rate (65.3)% 33.4% 26.7% The effective (income tax) benefit rate for 2004, 2003 and 2002 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance against certain domestic (U.S. federal, state and local) and foreign deferred tax assets, and, for 2004 only, the write off of nondeductible goodwill. During 2004, we increased our tax expense by $937 million as a result of our decision to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, primarily in the U.S. and Germany. We reached this decision by performing a review of all positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies, as well as related key assumptions. SFAS 109 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. SFAS 109 further requires that "greater weight be given to previous cumulative losses than the outlook for future profitability when determining whether deferred tax assets can be used." We have incurred significant losses in the U.S. and Germany due primarily to the restructuring and impairment charges and operating losses in our Telecommunications segment over the last four years. As a result of the third quarter of 2004 impairment charges and the lowering of our long term outlook for the Telecommunications segment, our largest U.S. and German business, we concluded that a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was required. We expect to maintain a valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Germany, is sustained or we are able to develop tax planning strategies that enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a larger portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable, or if the PCC settlement is finalized earlier than we anticipate. Until then, our tax provision will include only the net tax expense attributable to certain foreign operations. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of associated companies, net of impairments (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Samsung Corning Precision $ 277 $ 144 $ 80 Dow Corning 116 82 All other 50 (17) 36 Total equity earnings $ 443 $ 209 $ 116 The 2004 and 2003 increases in equity earnings of associated companies, net of impairments, are primarily due to the following: .. Strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision), our 50% owned South Korea based manufacturer of LCD glass. .. The recognition of equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation (Dow Corning) in 2003 and strong sales and earnings performance in 2004. In addition to the above, equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments, included the following restructuring and impairment charges: .. $35 million, $7 million and $34 million of charges to impair equity method investments in the Telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. .. In 2004, Dow Corning recorded charges related to restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded on its emergence from bankruptcy. Our equity earnings included $21 million related to these charges. .. In 2003, Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. recorded asset impairment charges. Our equity earnings included $66 million related to these charges. .. In 2002, Samsung Corning Micro Optics recorded asset impairment charges. Our equity earnings included $20 million related to these charges. Loss From Continuing Operations As a result of the above, the loss from continuing operations and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Loss from continuing operations $ (2,185) $ (223) $ (1,780) Basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations $ (1.57) $ (0.18) $ (1.85) Shares used in computing basic and diluted per share amounts 1,386 1,274 1,030 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 13, 2002, we completed the sale of our precision lens business to 3M Company (3M) for cash proceeds up to $850 million, of which $50 million was deposited in an escrow account. During 2002, we received approximately $800 million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of $415 million, net of tax, in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. 3M notified Corning that 3M believed it had certain claims arising out of the representations and warranties made by Corning in connection with the sale of the precision lens business to 3M. In the third quarter of 2004, Corning and 3M reached a final settlement agreement for the funds held in escrow. Accordingly, we received $20 million in cash and recorded a gain of $20 million. The precision lens business operating results and cash flows have been removed from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented, and have been excluded from the operating segments data. Refer to Note 2 (Discontinued Operations) to the consolidated financial statements for selected financial information for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2002. There were no results from discontinued operations in 2003. OPERATING SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments included Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. The Environmental Technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments, as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. The following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment: .. Display Technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays; .. Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry; .. Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications; and .. Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. Our segment presentation reflects how Cornings Chief Operating Decision Making group (CODM) allocates resources and assesses the performance of its businesses. We prepared the financial results for our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include interest, taxes and corporate functions. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Display Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Display Technologies segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 Net sales $ 1,113 $ 595 $ 405 87 47 Income before equity earnings $ 258 $ 91 $ 39 184 133 Equity earnings of associated companies $ 288 $ 144 $ 80 100 80 Net income $ 546 $ 235 $ 119 132 97 2004 vs. 2003 The 2004 sales increase is largely reflective of the overall LCD market growth. During 2004, glass substrate volumes (measured in square feet of glass sold) increased approximately 65%. Sales also benefited from modest average price increases, primarily the result of a change in product mix as the market continues to trend toward large size glass substrates (generation 5 and above) which carry a higher selling price per square foot. The sales of the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as such, our revenues are susceptible to movements in the US dollar Japanese Yen exchange rates. Sales benefited by approximately 10% from a weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to 2003. For 2004, the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were the impact of incremental volumes and efficiencies realized through the shift in production toward large size glass substrates. Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings. The increase in our equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision were largely driven by the same factors identified for our wholly owned business. The Display Technologies segment manufactures and sells glass substrates to a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. The most significant customers in these markets are AU Optronics Corp., Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., Hannstar Display Corp., Quanta Display Inc., Sharp Corporation, and Toppan CFI (Taiwan) Co., Ltd. LCD panels are used in computer products, such as notebook computers and desktop monitors, consumer electronics products, such as digital cameras and camcorders and car navigation systems, and LCD televisions. In 2004, these six LCD customers accounted for 76% of the Display Technologies segment sales. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales were also concentrated, with three LCD panel makers in Korea (Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., LG Philips LCD Co., and BOE Hydis Technology Co., Ltd.) accounting for 88% of sales. Corning and these customers have typically entered into multi year supply agreements for the purchase and sale of glass substrates. These agreements provide for Corning to supply a percentage of the customers requirements and include mechanisms for forecasting and ordering. During 2004, Corning improved the payment terms under these agreements to improve cash flow and reduce its working capital requirements. We expect the LCD market to continue to grow rapidly. We anticipate higher demand for LCD televisions, for which our LCD customers require larger size glass substrates. During 2004, Corning held discussions with several of its customers to discuss how to meet this demand. As part of its discussions, Corning has sought improved payment terms, including deposits against orders, to provide a greater degree of assurance that we are effectively building capacity to meet the needs of a rapidly growing industry. There can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. While the industry has grown rapidly, the pace of growth may be less than we anticipate, and it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand during certain periods. In 2004, Corning and a Taiwanese customer entered into a long term purchase and supply agreement (as amended) in which the Display Technologies segment will supply LCD glass to the customer over a five year period. As part of the agreement, the customer will make advance cash deposits of $460 million to Corning through 2006 for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. Corning received a total of $204 million of deposits against orders in 2004 and expects to receive an additional $171 million in 2005. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 10 (Other Liabilities) to the consolidated financial statements for further information. In the ordinary course of business, Corning will continue to negotiate multi year supply agreements with its large customers where feasible. 2003 vs. 2002 The 2003 sales increase was primarily due to volume gains of approximately 43%, as penetration of liquid crystal display panels in the desktop market increased, and favorable exchange rates. Earnings approximately doubled in 2003 compared to the prior year due to the increase in volume and significant gains in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision over the prior year. In July 2003, we announced a $180 million expansion of our liquid crystal display glass manufacturing facility in Taiwan. Outlook: We expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates. We continue to see positive trends in the penetration rates of LCDs into the end markets (notebook computers, monitors and televisions), and increasing demand for the large size substrates. Volume growth for the LCD market is anticipated to be between 40% and 60% in 2005, and we anticipate adding sufficient capacity to meet market growth. This market growth will occur at varying rates in the principal LCD markets of Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Sales of our wholly owned business are primarily to panel manufacturers in Japan and Taiwan with customers in Korea being serviced by Samsung Corning Precision. The actual growth rates in these markets will impact our sales and earnings performance. For 2005, we are anticipating price declines after two years of price stability as competitors bring on additional capacity. We also anticipate our costs will continue to decline. There can be no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the high rates experienced in recent years or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period. Consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, or price or other factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. For 2005, Cornings rate of sales growth is expected to be higher in the second half of the year based on anticipated increases in panel manufacturers capacity to meet the anticipated market demands for LCD televisions. We expect net income in the segment to increase significantly in 2005 based on the strong volume growth in our wholly owned business and increased equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision. Telecommunications The following table provides net sales and other data for the Telecommunications segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 755 $ 760 $ 859 (1) (12) Hardware and equipment 784 612 661 28 (7) Photonic technologies 54 111 (51) Total net sales $ 1,539 $ 1,426 $ 1,631 8 (13) Net loss $ (1,893) $ (169) $ (1,897) (1,020) (91) 2004 vs. 2003 During 2004 we experienced a stabilization of the telecommunications industry. Fiber volumes grew at a stronger than anticipated 18%, but pricing declined by 9% from 2003 levels. Although we are encouraged by the volume growth, the demand comes from a narrow band of customers and we do not view this as the beginning of a broader recovery in the industry. The primary driver for the 2004 sales growth was Verizon Communications fiber to the premises project in North America, with the most significant benefit realized in our hardware and equipment products. During 2004, one customer accounted for 13% of total segment sales, and 10 customers accounted for 47% of total segment sales. Offsetting this sales performance were the following items: .. During 2003 we completed the sale and exit of our photonic technologies business. .. On September 1, 2004 we completed the sale of our frequency controls business. This business had 2003 annual sales of $76 million. .. Sales in Japan were down in 2004, largely due to 2003 projects that were not repeated in 2004. Movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen and Euro, did not have a significant impact on 2004 sales compared to 2003. In June 2004, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued an anti dumping preliminary determination asserting that Corning had dumped optical fiber into China during 2002 and 2003 and imposed a 16% duty on Cornings optical fiber imports. Corning contested this preliminary determination, and in December 2004, the Ministry of Commerce concluded that Corning had not dumped optical fiber into China and the 16% duty was removed. The increased net loss for 2004 is primarily attributable to the goodwill, fixed asset and equity method investments impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2004. Refer to Results of Continuing Operations for additional information on these charges. 2003 vs. 2002 The 2003 sales decrease is primarily attributable to the global telecommunications market downturn that continued into 2003. Overall fiber volumes increased 11%, and pricing pressures continued with overall declines of 31%. The lack of capital spending by our customers negatively affected all product lines, and the sale of our appliance controls group further reduced hardware and equipment sales. Also during 2003, we completed the sale and exit of our photonic technologies business. Partially offsetting this was strong demand for optical fiber and cable products in Japan and China. 2003 volumes benefited from having the full year results of the Chinese fiber and cable entities acquired from Lucent Technologies in the fourth quarter of 2002. Outlook: We expect sales in 2005 to increase over 2004. We expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to grow, particularly in North America, but still do not view this as the beginning of a broad based industry recovery. We expect fiber volumes to increase modestly and pricing pressures should again be moderate. Sales improvement will largely be dependent on the continuation of Verizons fiber to the premises project, and should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. We expect to realize a loss in 2005, although at significantly lower levels than 2004. This reduction in anticipated segment loss is largely attributed to the impairment charges incurred in 2004, as well as the operational efficiencies from increased volumes in 2005. Environmental Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Environmental Technologies segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 Net sales: Automotive $ 479 $ 430 $ 375 11 15 Diesel 69 46 19 50 142 Total net sales $ 548 $ 476 $ 394 15 21 Net income $ 4 $ 9 $ 32 (56) (72) 2004 vs. 2003 The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily the result of demand for our automotive and diesel ceramic filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards around the world. Volumes for our automotive products were up slightly from 2003 and sales benefited from a higher mix of our thin wall and ultra thin wall substrates, which allow engine manufacturers to meet their emissions control requirements in a more cost effective manner. Our diesel products sales growth was primarily driven by demand from retrofit markets, although we experienced a softening in Asian retrofit markets in the second half of 2004. A portion of the sales of the Environmental Technologies segment are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Euro exchange rates. Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for 2004 compared to 2003. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of emission control systems, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters are generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. For 2004, four customers accounted for 69% of total segment sales. The 2004 decline in net income is primarily the result of increased development costs and plant start up costs to support our emerging diesel products. These costs offset the gross margin benefits of increased volumes and the higher mix of premium automotive products. Movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income. 2003 vs. 2002 The 2003 increase in net sales was primarily due to increased U.S. auto production driven by financing incentives, favorable mix of premium products, favorable exchange rates and higher sales for diesel products. The net income decrease was primarily due to a decrease in equity earnings from Cormetech, a U.S. designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts, and higher development spending for the diesel product line. Outlook: We expect sales to increase in 2005. For automotive products, we expect to see stable demand based on anticipated worldwide auto production, and a continuation of a shift to premium products; although at slightly slower rates than 2004. Although volumes are anticipated to be stable, a slowdown in auto production, particularly in North America, could adversely impact our growth projections. Diesel product sales are also expected to grow. Demand for diesel products in 2005 will be largely based on retrofit markets, and we expect a recovery of the Asian market during the year. In 2005, we must successfully complete the development of our diesel technology and have our filters designed into the specifications of engine manufacturers to meet anticipated demand in 2006 and beyond as diesel engine manufacturers ramp up production for the 2007 model years. The retrofit market is somewhat volatile, and any unanticipated declines in demand could adversely impact our expected 2005 sales growth. Net income for the segment is expected to increase only slightly in 2005 as we continue to spend heavily on research, development and engineering for diesel products. Life Sciences The following table provides net sales and other data for the Life Sciences segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 Net sales $ 304 $ 281 $ 280 8 Net income (loss) $ 12 $ 14 $ 25 (14) (44) 2004 vs. 2003 The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily due to volume increases across the majority of our product lines. Demand from research, development and production end users remained steady for 2004, which represented an improvement over the industry wide softness experienced in 2003. Movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, did not have a significant impact on sales for 2004 compared to 2003. The Life Sciences segment sells to a concentrated customer base, primarily distributors, who in turn sell to end users such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government entities, academic institutions and other research facilities. For 2004, two distributors accounted for 56% of total segment sales. One of these distributors communicated its intent to change its ongoing business strategy in the second half of 2004. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, Corning notified this distributor that we will not renew its existing distribution agreement, which will expire in April 2005. Approximately 30% of Life Sciences 2004 sales were made through this distributor. We are actively working to transition the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels. However, this change will likely adversely impact sales volumes in the short term. The 2004 decrease in net income is largely attributable to gross margin improvements resulting from the increase in sales volume being substantially offset by new product development costs. In addition, in 2003 net income benefited from a gain recognized on the disposition of a minor product line. Movement in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income. 2003 vs. 2002 Sales were flat in 2003, compared to 2002, primarily due to weak sales in Europe and a general softness in the market. Earnings were down 44% compared to the prior year. Improved manufacturing efficiencies, and a gain on the disposition of a minor product line, were more than offset by higher development spending. Outlook: We expect to see a continuation of the research, development and production spending in the life sciences market. Sales will likely be adversely impacted by as much as 10% to 20% by the recent changes in the distribution channel described above; particularly in the U.S. Net income for 2005 is expected to decline from 2004 levels, largely due to increases in new product development and commercialization expenditures and the anticipated impact of the changes in distribution channel. Unallocated and Other The following table provides net sales and other data (dollars in millions): % Change 2004 2003 2002 04 vs. 03 03 vs. 02 Conventional video components $ 3 $ 65 $ 166 (95) (61) Other businesses 347 247 288 40 (14) Total net sales $ 350 $ 312 $ 454 12 (31) Net (loss) income $ (834) $ (312) $ 419 167 (174) Unallocated and Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting (e.g. Specialty Materials, and Conventional Video Components), certain corporate investments (e.g. Dow Corning, Samsung Corning and Steuben), discontinued operations, and unallocated expenses. Unallocated expenses include research and other expenses related to new business development; gains or losses on repurchases and retirement of debt; charges related to the asbestos litigation; restructuring and impairment charges related to the corporate research and development or staff organizations; and charges for increases in our tax valuation allowance. Unallocated and Other also represents the reconciliation between the totals for the reportable segments and our consolidated total. The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily attributable to improvements in our Specialty Materials segment. Although this segment experienced strong sales growth in 2004, primarily for semiconductor lens glass, we do not expect the pace of growth to continue into 2005. The 2004 decrease in Conventional Video Components sales is due to our 2003 decision, along with our partner, to shutdown CAV. The 2003 decrease in net sales is primarily due to the shutdown of CAV and weak demand for semiconductor lens glass due to softness in the semiconductor market. Refer to Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and (Credits), Asbestos settlement, and (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes for a description of the key drivers of net (loss) income for 2004 vs. 2003 and 2003 vs. 2002. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing Structure During 2004, we engaged in the following significant transactions: .. Issued $400 million of senior unsecured notes under our existing universal shelf registration statement. At December 31, 2004, our remaining capacity under the shelf registration is approximately $2.5 billion. .. Retired a total of $487 million of our 3.5% convertible debentures and zero coupon convertible debentures in exchange for $154 million of cash and 38 million shares of common stock. .. Repaid $115 million of loans payable, the majority of which related to our 7.625% debentures due 2024, as a result of certain bond holders exercising their early repayment option. We currently have unrestricted access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility with 16 banks. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. The facility includes one financial covenant limiting the ratio of total debt to total capital, as defined, to not greater than 60%. At December 31, 2004, this ratio was 41%. Our revolving credit facility expires in August 2005 and we are currently negotiating with leading financial institutions to arrange a new credit facility. We believe that a new credit facility will be arranged and executed in the first half of 2005 on competitive terms and conditions. Corning is seeking up to a $1.0 billion credit facility with up to a five year term. Among the terms and conditions being negotiated, Corning believes it will be subject to two financial covenants. The remaining zero coupon convertible debentures, totaling $272 million at December 31, 2004, will likely be put back to us on November 8, 2005, at $819.54 per debenture or on November 8, 2010, at $905.29 per debenture. We have the option of settling this obligation in cash, common stock, or a combination of both. From time to time, we may retire additional debt securities for cash or equity. Additionally, effective November 8, 2004, we have the right to redeem some or all of the outstanding 3.5% convertible debentures at any time prior to maturity at redemption prices ranging from 102.0% to 100.5% of the principal amount based on the date we exercise our redemption options. It is possible that during 2005 we may exercise this redemption option, or execute other privately negotiated transactions, to retire some or all of our $297 million outstanding 3.5% convertible debentures. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $857 million, $366 million and $357 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital spending activity in 2004, 2003 and 2002 primarily included expansion of LCD capacity and new capacity for diesel substrates. Our 2005 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of$1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, of which $900 million to $1.1 billion will be to expand manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment. These expenditures primarily relate to previously announced expansion plans for our existing manufacturing facilities in Tainan, Taiwan and Shizuoka, Japan and for the construction of a new facility in Taichung, Taiwan. Additionally, approximately $140 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment in anticipation of the emerging diesel emissions control market. Restructuring During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we made payments of $85 million, $233 million and $278 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Cash payments for employee related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2005, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2007. Key Balance Sheet Data At December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.9 billion, compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase from December 31, 2003, was primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of long term debt and improved operating cash flows, including the receipt of $204 million in customer deposits. Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): As of December 31, 2004 2003 Working capital $ 945 $ 1,141 Working capital, excluding cash and short term investments $ (936) $ (125) Current ratio 1.4:1 1.7:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 585 $ 525 Days sales outstanding 52 58 Inventories $ 535 $ 467 Inventory turns 4.9 4.8 Days payable outstanding 67 52 Long term debt $ 2,214 $ 2,668 Total debt to total capital 41% 34% Credit Ratings As of February 22, 2005, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Outlook Last Update Long Term Debt Last Update Fitch BB+ Positive August 12, 2004 August 12, 2004 Standard & Poors BB+ Stable July 29, 2002 January 16, 2004 Moodys Ba2 Positive July 29, 2002 January 14, 2005 Our 2004 earnings were not adequate to cover our fixed charges (principally interest and related charges on debt), primarily as a result of the impairment charges in the Telecommunications segment and our decision to increase our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. We expect our full year 2005 earnings will be sufficient to cover our fixed charges. Management Assessment of Liquidity Our major source of funding for 2005 and beyond will be our existing balance of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. From time to time we may also issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses. We are currently negotiating with leading financial institutions for a new credit facility and believe we will arrange and execute one in the first half of 2005. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, restructuring, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. Contractual Obligations Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 5 years and (In millions) Total 1 year years years years thereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 104 $ 26 $ 2 $ 1 $ 1 $ 74 Credit facilities for equity companies 167 17 150 Stand by letters of credit (1) 52 42 10 Loan guarantees 12 1 11 Purchase obligations (2) 67 49 16 2 Capital expenditure obligations (3) 388 388 Total debt (4) 2,694 482 16 119 411 1,666 Minimum rental commitments 223 40 32 37 39 75 Total commitments and contingencies $ 3,707 $ 1,028 $ 66 $ 157 $ 468 $ 1,988 (1) At December 31, 2004, $34 million of the $52 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Balance primarily represents obligations associated with the Telecommunications segment. (3) Capital expenditure obligations primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, which are included on our balance sheet. (4) At December 31, 2004, $2,692 million of the $2,694 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value. We have provided other financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning as discussed in Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. Pensions We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2004, this plan accounted for 82% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91% of the related plans assets. In 2004 and 2003, although global equities had positive returns, interest rates continued to decline. As a result, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets, which required Corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." Balances of these non cash adjustments follow (in millions): December 31, 2004 2003 Minimum pension liability $ 417 $ 310 Intangible assets 42 51 Other accumulated comprehensive loss, pre tax 375 259 Other accumulated comprehensive loss, after tax 273 159 We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2008. We contributed $40 million in 2004 to our U.S. pension plan. For 2005, we anticipate making voluntary contributions of at least $100 million in cash or common stock to this plan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of goodwill SFAS 142 requires us to make certain difficult, subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, which are the same as our segments. We measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. Telecommunications Pricing in the telecommunications industry remains depressed. Our previous forecasts assumed some rationalization of capacity that would lead to more stable pricing. We now expect the current depressed pricing conditions to persist. Based on competitive conditions and forecasted future customer requirements, we do not expect the level of demand for premium fiber products we previously forecasted. As a result, we have significantly reduced our outlook for future revenue and profitability from premium products. As we forecast customer demand, we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the longer range. Further negative developments in the telecommunications industry could cause us to change our forecasts for fiber volumes, pricing or mix of premium products which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges of up to $123 million. Terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. These cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill. The discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of 11 public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. For our 2004 impairment test, we used a discount rate of 12.5% in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows. An impairment charge of $1,420 million was recorded in 2004. Had we used a discount rate of 12%, the impairment charge would have been approximately $90 million lower. Had we used a discount rate of 13%, the impairment charge would have been approximately $80 million higher. In 2003, we used a 12% discount rate for our annual impairment test. The results of our 2003 test indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The 2003 results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 11.5% or 12.5%. Specialty Materials Our discounted cash flow test for this reporting unit assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. The discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows represents weighed average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of eight public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. For the 2004 and 2003 impairment tests we used a discount rate of 12% in our calculation of the fair value of the expected future cash flows. The results of our 2004 and 2003 tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 11.5% or 12.5%. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In 2004, based on our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our outlook for the Telecommunications segment, we determined an event of impairment had occurred in our Telecommunications segment. We performed an impairment test on the segments long lived assets, and recorded a $24 million charge to write down certain assets to their fair value. In 2003, we concluded events of impairment had occurred in our semiconductor materials product line, which is part of the specialty materials segment, and performed an impairment test. The results of our test indicated that our long lived assets held for use were not impaired. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions During 2004 and 2003, we recorded write downs of property, plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. Assets impaired were primarily equipment, construction in progress and buildings, which were sold or abandoned. We used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment. The estimated salvage values were very low, primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment. The salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves. Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes SFAS 109 requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004, Corning had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $2.3 billion. We determined that the likelihood of realization of certain deferred tax assets is less than 50% and recorded additional valuation allowances of $1.2 billion in 2004 to reduce our net deferred tax assets to $532 million. If we sustain an appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Germany, or if we are able to develop additional tax planning strategies, or if the PCC settlement is finalized earlier than we anticipate, adjustments to these allowances will be required and may affect future net income. In determining the amount of domestic deferred tax assets that we believe are more likely than not to be realized through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of a non strategic asset, we estimated the fair value of the underlying non strategic asset based primarily on discounted cash flows and precedent transactions. Changes in fair value of the non strategic asset may also affect future net income. Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter, as well as known outcomes in case law. See Legal Proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the PCC asbestos liability. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending ourselves against asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives, and other factors. We have reached a tentative settlement on PCC as disclosed in Legal Proceedings and Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans (as of December 31, 2004 the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,056 million and the minimum pension liability charges to equity with respect to U.S. pension plans was $279 million net of tax): Effect on Effect on 2005 December 31, 2004 Change in Assumption Pre Tax Pension Expense PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$4 million +$57 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $4 million $55 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$4 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $4 million The above sensitivities reflect impact of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2004, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $55 million before tax; a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $53 million. With a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate, certain pension plans would become Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) underfunded resulting in a significantly larger impact on equity compared to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Effect on 2005 Effect on Pre Tax OPEB December 31, 2004 Change in Assumption Expense APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$1 million +$19 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $1 million $19 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. ENVIRONMENT We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 11 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. We have accrued approximately $14 million for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at December 31, 2004. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 amends ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Corning is required to adopt SFAS 151 effective January 1, 2006. Corning does not expect the adoption of SFAS 151 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements at fair value beginning in Cornings third quarter. Under SFAS 123R, Corning must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost, and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The standard permits three transition method adoption alternatives: .. "Prospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing share based payments after July 1, 2005. Prior interim and annual periods would not be restated. .. "Modified prospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing share based payments effective January 1, 2005. Prior annual periods would not be restated. .. "Modified retrospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing share based payments effective January 1, 2005. Prior annual periods would be restated. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 123R will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition, which in part will be dependent on the transition and amortization methods used to adopt the new rules in 2005. Our current estimate is that our 2005 pretax expense will be in the range of $25 million to $50 million, and that future years expense will approximate $60 million. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions" ("SFAS 153"). SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions," and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Corning is required to adopt SFAS 153 effective January 1, 2006. Corning does not expect the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions; tariffs, import duties and currency fluctuations; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; sufficiency of manufacturing capacity and efficiencies; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or major health concerns; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; capital resource and cash flow activities; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand, which may fluctuate; interest costs; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; stock price fluctuations; the rate of substitution by end users purchasing LCDs for notebook computers, desktop monitors and televisions; a downturn in demand for LCD glass substrates; ability of our customers, most notably in the Display Technologies segment, to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their manufacturing expansions; fluctuations in inventory levels in the supply chain; equity company activities, principally at Dow Corning Corporation and Samsung Corning Co., Ltd.; and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rate effects includes: .. exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and .. exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and western European countries. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Equity in earnings of associated companies has historically contributed a significant amount of our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments was $443 million in 2004 and $209 million in 2003 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 70% of this amount. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $309 million for 2004 and $105 million in 2003. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2004, we had open forward contracts, open option contracts, foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2004. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $122 million. Specific to the Japanese Yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted Yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $45 million. The nature of our foreign exchange rate risk exposures has not changed materially from December 31, 2003. As we derive more than 60% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our outlooks included in Managements Discussion and Analysis assume no significant changes in currency exchange rates during 2005. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately $180 million and net income of approximately $150 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately $50 million but would have a negligible effect on net income. Interest Rate Risk Management In March and April of 2002, we entered into three interest rate swaps that are fair value hedges and economically exchanged a notional amount of $275 million of fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we paid the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the six month LIBOR rate and received the fixed rates of 8.3% to 8.875%, which are the stated interest rates on the long term debt instruments. As a result of these transactions, Corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. In 2004 and 2003, we terminated the interest rate swap agreements described above. The termination of these swaps resulted in gains of $5 million in 2004 and $15 million in 2003 which we will amortize to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. The cash proceeds from the termination of the swaps totaled $8 million in 2004 and $17 million in 2003 and are included in the financing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows. It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our policy sets a maximum cap that total variable rate debt will not exceed 35% of the total debt portfolio at anytime. At December 31, 2004, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.
