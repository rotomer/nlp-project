Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We continued to focus on three significant priorities in 2005: protect our financial health, improve profitability, and invest in our future. We made significant progress on all three in 2005. Financial Health During 2005, we strengthened our balance sheet and delivered positive cash flows from operating activities. The following are key accomplishments for 2005: .. As part of a debt reduction program, we reduced the net amount of our outstanding debt by $885 million through a combination of retirements and scheduled repayments. .. All three rating agencies upgraded our ratings to investment grade. .. We received $457 million in deposits against orders relating to our multi year supply agreements with customers in the Display Technologies segment. These agreements have helped us to meet the rapid growth of the liquid crystal display (LCD) market. .. We generated sufficient cash flows from operating activities to cover our capital expenditures. We ended 2005 with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. This represents an increase of $553 million from December 31, 2004. In the first quarter of 2005, we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a group of banks. This facility, which continues through March 2010, provides us access to a $975 million unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. Profitability For the year ended December 31, 2005, we generated net income of $585 million or $0.38 per share compared to a net loss of $2,165 million or $1.56 per share for 2004. We recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2005 and 2004 which affect the comparability of those years. Refer to Note 3 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)), Note 6 (Income Taxes), and Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Investing in our future We remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. We are investing in a wide variety of technologies with a focus on glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises. Our research, development and engineering expenditures have increased by $88 million or 25% compared to 2004. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our growth strategies. We also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses. Our capital expenditures are primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment and diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Total capital expenditures for 2005 were $1,553 million, of which $1,250 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $171 million was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment primarily in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems. We expect our 2006 capital spending to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, of which $900 million to $1.1 billion will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment and approximately $200 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): % Change 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 Net sales $ 4,579 $ 3,854 $ 3,090 19 25 Gross margin $ 1,984 $ 1,415 $ 849 40 67 (gross margin %) 43% 37% 27% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 756 $ 653 $ 599 16 9 (as a % of revenues) 17% 17% 19% Research, development and engineering expenses $ 443 $ 355 $ 344 25 3 (as a % of revenues) 10% 9% 11% Restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) $ (38) $ 1,789 $ 111 (102) 1,512 (as a % of revenues) (1)% 46% 4% Asbestos settlement $ 197 $ 33 $ 413 497 (92) (as a % of revenues) 4% 1% 13% Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 572 $(1,580) $ (759) (136) 108 (as a % of revenues) 13% (41)% (25)% (Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (578) $(1,031) $ 254 (44) (506) (as a % of revenues) (13)% (27)% 8% Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments $ 598 $ 443 $ 209 35 112 (as a % of revenues) 13% 11% 7% Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 585 $(2,185) $ (223) (127) 880 (as a % of revenues) 13% (57)% (7)% Net Sales The net sales increase in 2005 was the result of a significant increase in demand for LCD glass substrates in our Display Technologies segment and modest gains in demand for products in our Telecommunications segment to support fiber to the premises projects and our Environmental segment due to increased sales of diesel filters. Net sales for our Life Sciences segment declined due to changes in the distribution channels. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the comparison of net sales between 2005 and 2004. The net sales increase in 2004 was the result of strong demand for glass substrates in our Display Technologies segment, demand for hardware and equipment products in our Telecommunications segment, and improvements across the majority of our other businesses. These improvements were partially offset by the 2003 exit of our photonic technologies and U.S. conventional television glass businesses. Movements in foreign exchange rates, did not significantly impact the comparison of net sales between 2004 and 2003. Reflecting the growth in our Display Technologies segment, net sales into international markets continue to increase at a faster rate than those into the U.S. market. For 2005, 2004, and 2003, sales into international markets accounted for 71%, 65%, and 60% of net sales, respectively. Gross Margin As a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved 6 percentage points in 2005 when compared to 2004. The improvement in overall gross margin dollars and as a percentage of net sales was driven by increased volume, improved mix of large generation glass, and manufacturing efficiencies in our Display Technologies segment. For 2004, as a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved by 10 percentage points versus 2003. The improvement was driven by net sales growth in the Display Technologies segment of 87%, operating efficiencies in our Telecommunications segment, and the 2003 exit of the conventional television glass business. Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for both 2005 and 2004, when compared to the previous years, was primarily driven by increases in compensation costs. As a percent of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses were comparable for 2005 and 2004. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $88 million in 2005. The majority of the increase in 2005 expenditures related to our growth initiatives including glass substrates for LCDs, diesel filter and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, as well as exploratory projects to support future growth. Expenditures on Display Technologies projects, Environmental Technologies projects, and Life Sciences projects increased when compared with 2004. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded significant net charges in 2004 which affect the comparability of our results for 2005, 2004, and 2003. A summary of the net charges and credits for all years presented is provided in the following table (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Impairment of goodwill $ 1,420 Impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment $ 6 302 $ 41 Assets to be held and used 24 Reversal of currency translation adjustment (84) Accelerated depreciation 37 12 Loss on sale of businesses 12 13 Impairment of available for sale securities 25 4 Restructuring charges and (credits) 15 (6) 41 Total restructuring, impairment other charges and (credits) $ (38) $ 1,789 $ 111 Impairment of Goodwill 2004 Impairment Charge Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," (SFAS 142) goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level. In addition, goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value. In the third quarter of 2004, we identified certain factors that caused us to lower our estimates and projections for the long term revenue growth of the Telecommunications segment, which indicated that the fair value of the Telecommunications segment reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We performed an interim impairment test of the Telecommunications segment goodwill in the third quarter of 2004 and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of $1,420 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value at September 30, 2004 of $117 million. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill Given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing certain of our businesses, at various times throughout 2003 to 2005, we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our held for use long lived assets other than goodwill. When an impairment evaluation was required, we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated. If our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows, we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets, which were limited to property, plant and equipment, using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. 2005 Impairment Charge Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment In 2005, we recorded $6 million of charges related to adjustments to prior year restructuring reserves for our Telecommunications segment. 2004 Impairment Charge Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment These charges comprise the following: . Telecommunications segment: In 2004, we recorded a net charge of $344 million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to be disposed of or shutdown. Approximately $332 million of this net charge was comprised of the partially completed sections of our Concord, N.C. optical fiber facility. As a result of our lowered outlook, we have permanently abandoned this construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the investment necessary to complete this facility. We have mothballed and will continue to depreciate the separate previously operated portion of the Concord fiber facility. . Other businesses: We recorded net credits of $42 million, primarily for gains on the sale of assets CAV sold to a third party in China. This represented proceeds in excess of assumed salvage values for assets previously impaired. This represented the substantial completion of the sale of CAVs assets. Assets to be held and used Due to our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our long term outlook for the Telecommunications segment in 2004, we determined that an event of impairment had occurred in our Telecommunications segment which required us to test the segments long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment. As a result of this impairment evaluation, we recorded a $24 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2004 to write down certain assets to fair value. 2003 Impairment Charge Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment These charges comprise the following: . Telecommunications segment: We recorded charges of $24 million to impair plant and equipment related to the shutdown of a cabling plant and the final exit of the photonic technologies business. The charges were more than offset by a $61 million credit related to previous restructuring plans, primarily the result of our decision not to exit two of the cable sites previously marked for shutdown in 2002. . Other businesses: We recorded charges of $78 million, primarily related to our decision to shutdown CAV, and the closure of our North Brookfield semiconductor materials plant. Other Credits 2005 Reversal of Currency Translation Adjustment In 2003, Corning sold its photonic business operations to Avanex. The photonics business was the sole operation of Corning O.T.I. S.r.l. (OTI), a wholly owned Italian subsidiary of Corning, whose results were included in Cornings Telecommunications segment. Subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of OTI to Avanex, Corning began liquidating OTI. In October 2005, the assets of OTI were determined to be substantially liquidated. As a result of the substantial liquidation, OTIs cumulative translation account was reversed, resulting in a gain of $84 million in the fourth quarter. Accelerated Depreciation 2004 Accelerated Depreciation We recorded $37 million of accelerated depreciation relating to the final shutdown of our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2003. 2003 Accelerated Depreciation We recorded $12 million of accelerated depreciation as a result of our decision to shutdown our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in Charleston, South Carolina by March 31, 2004. Loss on Sale of Businesses 2004 Loss on Sale of Business On September 1, 2004 we completed the sale of our frequency controls business, which was part of the Telecommunications segment, for net cash proceeds of $80 million. We recorded a loss on the sale of $14 million, which included an allocation of $30 million of the Telecommunications segment goodwill. The frequency controls business had 2003 annual sales of $76 million. 2003 Loss on Sale of Business In the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a $13 million loss on the sale of a significant portion of our photonic technologies business, which was part of our Telecommunications segment. Impairment of Available for Sale Securities 2005 Impairment Charge In 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $25 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in Avanex Corporation (Avanex) below its adjusted cost basis. Our investment in Avanex was accounted for as an available for sale security under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our shares of Avanex. 2003 Impairment Charge In 2003, we recorded a $5 million charge for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the Telecommunications segment, subsequently sold these investments for $4 million in cash, and reported the resulting $1 million gain as a credit to restructuring actions. Restructuring Actions 2005 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $15 million in 2005 which included the following: . A charge of $30 million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment. . Net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling $15 million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of CAV and to our specialty materials business. 2004 Restructuring Actions There were no significant restructuring actions taken during 2004, nor were there any significant revisions to estimates used in prior year restructuring plans. 2003 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $41 million in 2003. Major actions approved and initiated in 2003 included the following: . The shutdown of CAV. . The exit of our photonics products within the Telecommunications segment. . Credits to prior year restructuring plans, primarily the result of our decision not to exit two small cabling sites previously identified for shutdown in 2002. . The shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing facilities in North Brookfield and Charleston, South Carolina. Legal Settlement Asbestos On March 28, 2003, we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on a settlement arrangement that was thereafter incorporated into the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) plan of reorganization (the PCC Plan). This settlement remains subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the Bankruptcy Court. If the PCC Plan is approved and becomes effective, our settlement will require the contribution of our equity interest in PCC, our one half equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), and 25 million shares of our common stock. The common stock will be marked to market each quarter until the PCC Plan is approved, thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate. Corning will also make cash payments of $152 million (net present value as of December 31, 2005) in six installments beginning one year after the plan is effective. In addition, we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement. Two of Cornings primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation. The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to consider objections to the PCC Plan were held in the Bankruptcy Court in May 2004. The parties filed post hearing briefs and made oral arguments to the Bankruptcy Court in November 2004. The Bankruptcy Court allowed an additional round of briefing to address current case law developments and heard additional oral arguments on March 16, 2005. In mid April 2005, the proponents of the PCC Plan requested that the court rule on the pending objections. If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve the PCC Plan in its current form, changes to the Plan are probable as it is likely that the Court will allow the proponents time to propose amendments. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain, and confirmation of the current Plan or any amended Plan is subject to a number of contingencies. However, apart from the quarterly mark to market adjustment in the value of the 25 million shares of Corning stock, management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. The following summarizes the charges we have recorded for the asbestos settlement (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Initial settlement charge $ 298 Mark to market common stock $ 197 $ 33 115 Asbestos settlement $ 197 $ 33 $ 413 See Legal Proceedings for a history of this matter. Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes In addition to the drivers identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) and Asbestos Settlement, we also retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during 2005, 2004 and 2003 that resulted in the following (losses) gains for the respective periods (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 (Loss) gain on retirement of debt (16) (36) 19 Movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income (loss) from continuing operations for the years presented. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Our provision (benefit) for income taxes and the related effective income tax (benefit) rates were as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 578 $ 1,031 $ (254) Effective income tax (benefit) rate 101.0% 65.2% (33.4)% The effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2005 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to an increase in income tax expense of $525 million resulting from an increase in Cornings valuation allowance. The increase in the valuation allowance was the result of our conclusion that the sale of an appreciated asset was no longer prudent and, as such, no longer meets the criteria in SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109) for a viable tax planning strategy. The difference between the effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2004 and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance against certain domestic (U.S. federal, state and local) and foreign deferred tax assets, and the write off of nondeductible goodwill. For 2005, the tax provision reflected the following items: .. The impact of our inability to record tax benefits on net operating losses generated in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions; .. An increase in our valuation allowance of $525 million; .. The benefit of a worthless stock deduction (and a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance) for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the Pirelli acquisition which was completed in December 2000 and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of 2001; .. The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in Taiwan and tax holidays in China and South Africa; .. The benefit from the reversal of tax contingency liabilities following the conclusion of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations; and .. An $82 million credit primarily for the tax effect of eliminating our minimum pension liability for the domestic qualified plan. In 2004, significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation allowances against certain U.S. and German deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 3 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)) for additional information on these events and the related charges. Accordingly, we increased our valuation allowance by $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2004 to reduce our net deferred tax assets to approximately $530 million. At that time, we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net deferred tax assets through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in Dow Corning Corporation (DCC), a non strategic appreciated asset, if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards. During 2005, DCCs performance was much stronger than expected and DCC resumed paying a dividend; both of which are expected to continue in the future. Due to this improved performance, DCC now provides strong financial, geographic and market balance to Cornings portfolio of businesses, the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment. As a result, we now consider DCC to be a strategic investment and can no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of DCC would be prudent, as required by FAS 109. Therefore, we no longer believe that it is more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have increased our valuation allowance by $525 million to fully reserve our net U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. We expect to maintain a valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Germany, is sustained or we are able to develop tax planning strategies that enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable. Until then, our tax provision will include only the net tax expense attributable to certain foreign operations. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During the third quarter of 2005, Corning filed its 2004 consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return, which included a $3.9 billion worthless stock deduction for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the Pirelli acquisition. This acquisition was completed in December 2000 and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of 2001. Prior to the third quarter of 2005, we did not record a deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate realization of such deduction was uncertain, and consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," recognition of an asset prior to the time management determines the realization of the asset is probable is prohibited. On September 2, 2005, Corning and the Commissioner of the IRS entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which provides that Corning is entitled to this worthless stock deduction. We recorded a $1.5 billion deferred tax asset for this item in the third quarter, which was concurrently offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount due to our current inability to record tax benefits for U.S. net operating losses. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China, South Africa, Korea and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in future years (2006 to 2009) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 8.6%, 1.2%, and 0.5% for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Equity in Earnings of Associated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of associated companies, net of impairments (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Samsung Corning Precision $ 408 $ 277 $ 144 Dow Corning 253 116 82 Samsung Corning (112) 32 (39) All other 49 18 22 Total equity earnings $ 598 $ 443 $ 209 The 2005 and 2004 increases in equity earnings of associated companies, net of impairments, are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Precision, our 50% owned South Korea based manufacturer of LCD glass, and at Dow Corning, our 50% owned U.S. based manufacturer of silicone products. In addition to the above, equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments, included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits: .. In 2005, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube (CRT) glass business. The charge, which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs, reduced Cornings equity earnings by $106 million in the third quarter. As Samsung Corning executes its restructuring plan over the next several quarters, additional severance and shutdown costs may be required. We expect our share of these charges to approximate $30 million. None of the charges is expected to result in cash expenditures by Corning. .. In 2005, Dow Corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock. Our equity earnings included $11 million related to this gain. .. In 2004 and 2003, Corning incurred charges of $35 million and $7 million, respectively, to impair equity method investments in the Telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value. .. In 2004, Dow Corning recorded charges related to restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded on its emergence from bankruptcy. Our equity earnings included $21 million related to these charges. .. In 2003, Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. recorded asset impairment charges. Our equity earnings included $66 million related to these charges. Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations As a result of the above, the income (loss) from continuing operations and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 585 $(2,185) $ (223) Basic earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations $ 0.40 $ (1.57) $ (0.18) Diluted earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations $ 0.38 $ (1.57) $ (0.18) Shares used in computing basic per share amounts 1,464 1,386 1,274 Shares used in computing diluted per share amounts 1,535 1,386 1,274 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In the third quarter of 2004, Corning and 3M reached a final settlement agreement for funds held in escrow associated with the 2002 sale of Cornings precision lens business to 3M. As a result, we recognized a $20 million gain upon receipt of the proceeds in 2004. OPERATING SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments include Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. The Environmental Technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments, as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. The following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment: .. Display Technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays; .. Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry; .. Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications; and .. Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include interest, taxes and corporate functions. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2006, Corning changed its measurement of segment profit or loss as follows: .. We removed the net impact of financing costs, such as interest expense on debt instruments and interest costs associated with benefit plans, from reportable segments and included these amounts in Corporate unallocated expense. .. We changed the allocation method for taxes to more closely reflect the companys current tax position. .. We removed the impact of non cash stock compensation expense from reportable segments and included this amount in Corporate unallocated expense. .. We removed the allocation of exploratory research, development and engineering expense from reportable segments and included these amounts in Corporate unallocated expense. .. We changed certain other allocation methods for corporate functions. The following discussion reflects segment information as reported for 2005 and has not been restated to reflect the changes to segment performance measurement made effective January 1, 2006. Refer to Note 19 (Subsequent Events) for additional information on the change in segment profit or loss measurement. Display Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Display Technologies segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 Net sales $ 1,742 $ 1,113 $ 595 57 87 Income before equity earnings $ 679 $ 258 $ 91 163 184 Equity earnings of associated companies $ 416 $ 288 $ 144 44 100 Net income $ 1,095 $ 546 $ 235 101 132 2005 vs. 2004 The 2005 sales increase reflects the continued overall growth of the LCD glass substrate market. During 2005, glass substrate volumes (measured in square feet of glass sold) increased approximately 64% compared with the same period in 2004. Weighted average selling prices decreased 2% compared to 2004. Included in this weighted average were selling price declines that were offset by increases in the market demand for large size glass substrates (generation 5 and above), which carry a higher selling price per square foot. For 2005, large size glass substrates accounted for 69% of total sales volumes, compared to 46% in 2004. Although sales of the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen, movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales. For 2005, the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were higher volumes, ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, and a lower effective tax rate. Movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings. The increase in our equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision was largely driven by higher volumes and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. For the year ended December 31, 2005, AU Optronics Corporation, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd., Sharp Corporation, and Hannstar Display Corporation, each of which accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 75% of total segment sales. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2005, sales to three LCD panel makers located in Korea, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., LG Phillips LCD Co., and Dong Woo STI, accounted for 98% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales. In 2005 and 2004, Corning and several customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which the Display Technologies segment will supply large size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. In 2005 and 2004, we received a total of $457 million and $204 million, respectively, of deposits against orders. In the event the customers do not make all customer deposit installment payments or elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 10 (Other Accrued Liabilities) to the consolidated financial statements for further information. In the ordinary course of business, Corning will continue to negotiate multi year supply agreements with its large customers where feasible but we believe it is unlikely that we will negotiate agreements which require additional deposits. Corning is investing heavily to expand capacity to meet increasing demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2005, capital spending was $1.25 billion and is expected to be $900 million to $1.1 billion in 2006. Capital spending in 2006 will be used mainly to expand manufacturing facilities in Tainan, Taiwan, Taichung, Taiwan, and Shizuoka, Japan. 2004 vs. 2003 The 2004 sales increase is largely reflective of the overall LCD market growth. During 2004, glass substrate volumes increased approximately 65%. Sales also benefited from modest average price increases, primarily the result of a change in product mix as the market trended toward large size glass. Sales benefited by approximately 10% from a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen compared to 2003. For 2004, the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were the impact of incremental volumes and efficiencies realized through the shift in production toward large size glass substrates. The increase in equity earnings were driven by the same factors as those identified for our wholly owned business. Outlook: We expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates. We continue to see positive trends in the penetration rates of LCD glass into the end markets (notebook computers, monitors and televisions), and increasing demand for the large size substrates. However, we expect the growth of LCD glass to be more heavily influenced by the penetration of LCD in the television end market. We anticipate the volume growth in the LCD market to be over 40% in 2006. We expect the market volume for large size glass substrates (Generation 5.5 and higher) to grow more than 150% in 2006. As a result of the expected growth in large size substrates, we believe our total glass volume will grow faster than the overall LCD market in 2006. This market growth is expected to occur at varying rates in the principal LCD markets of Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Sales of our wholly owned business are primarily to panel manufacturers in Japan and Taiwan with customers in Korea being serviced by Samsung Corning Precision. The actual growth rates in these markets will impact our sales and earnings performance. For 2006, we anticipate price declines that are more significant than experienced in previous years as competitors bring on additional capacity. In the third quarter of 2005, we began production at our new Taichung, Taiwan manufacturing facility. The ramp up of production and our ability to efficiently start up operations may impact profitability the first half of 2006. In addition, we are beginning to see increased amounts of larger sized glass in the marketplace from competitors. There can be no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the high rates experienced in recent quarters or that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand. Although we believe we can continue to reduce our manufacturing costs, there can be no assurance that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period. While the industry has grown rapidly, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, or price or other factors, may lead to pauses in market growth, and it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. Telecommunications The following table provides net sales and other data for the Telecommunications segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 834 $ 755 $ 760 10 (1) Hardware and equipment 789 784 612 1 28 Photonic technologies 54 Total net sales $ 1,623 $ 1,539 $ 1,426 5 8 Net income (loss) $ 36 $ (1,893) $ (169) (102) (1,020) 2005 vs. 2004 Results for the Telecommunications segment reflected a solid performance in 2005. The net sales increase was largely driven by sales in North America and Europe. Stronger North American volumes and sales of the hardware and equipment business were largely the result of sales to Verizon to support their fiber to the premises project. Excluding the impact of the frequency controls business, a hardware and equipment manufacturer sold in September 2004, net sales for the Telecommunications segment increased 10% in 2005 when compared to the previous year. Movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact sales for either 2005 or 2004. For the Telecommunications segment, net income in 2005 and the net loss in 2004 were impacted by restructuring, impairment, and other charges and (credits). In 2005, we recorded net after tax credits of $47 million related to these items and in 2004, we recorded after tax charges of $1,798 million. Refer to Results of Continuing Operations for a detailed discussion of these charges. The Telecommunications segment continues to have a concentrated customer base. For the year ended December 31, 2005, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, each of which accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 29% of total segment sales. For 2005 and 2004, Verizon accounted for 17% and 13%, respectively, of total segment net sales. 2004 vs. 2003 During 2004 fiber volumes grew at 18% while pricing declined by 9% from 2003 levels. The primary driver for the 2004 sales growth was Verizons fiber to the premises project in North America, with the largest benefit realized in our hardware and equipment products. Offsetting this sales performance were the following items: .. During 2003 we completed the sale and exit of our photonic technologies business. .. On September 1, 2004, we sold our frequency controls business. This business had annual sales of $76 million in 2003. .. Sales in Japan were down in 2004, largely due to 2003 projects that were not repeated in 2004. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen and euro, did not have a significant impact on 2004 sales compared to 2003. In 2004, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued an anti dumping preliminary determination asserting that Corning had dumped optical fiber into China during 2002 and 2003 and imposed a 16% duty on Cornings optical fiber imports which Corning later contested. Although the Ministry of Commerce, in December 2004, concluded that Corning had not dumped optical fiber into China, and removed the duty, Cornings market share in China was negatively impacted. The increased net loss for 2004 is primarily attributable to the goodwill, fixed asset and equity method investments impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2004. Refer to Results of Continuing Operations for additional information on these charges. Outlook: For the Telecommunications segment, we expect sales in 2006 to remain even with 2005 as volume gains are offset by price declines. We expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable particularly in North America. Sales volumes will largely be dependent on the continuation of Verizons fiber to the premises project and cable and hardware and equipment sales to private networks. Changes in the expected Verizon deployment plan, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect the sales level. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. Environmental Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Environmental Technologies segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 Net sales: Automotive $ 482 $ 479 $ 430 1 11 Diesel 98 69 46 42 50 Total net sales $ 580 $ 548 $ 476 6 15 Net (loss) income $ (26) $ 4 $ 9 (750) (56) 2005 vs. 2004 The 2005 increase in net sales was the result of continued growth in diesel products sales in response to tightening emissions control standards around the world. Diesel products sales growth is currently driven, in part, by demand from retrofit markets, particularly in Korea. In the first half of 2005, we received letters of intent and other expressions of intent from diesel engine manufacturers to supply filters for their 2007 model year platforms. We are continuing to negotiate with several diesel engine manufacturers to develop supply agreements. Negotiations are likely to continue through the first half of 2006. For automotive products, sales in 2005 were flat when compared to prior year. The 2005 decrease in net income compared to 2004 resulted primarily from increased operating expenses primarily to support our emerging diesel products. Movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment in 2005 when compared to 2004. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters are generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. For 2005, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, each of which accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 76% of total segment sales. 2004 vs. 2003 The 2004 increase in net sales was primarily the result of demand for our automotive and diesel ceramic filters and substrates. Volumes for our automotive products were up slightly from 2003 and sales benefited from a higher mix of our thin wall and ultra thin wall substrates, which allow engine manufacturers to meet their emissions control requirements in a more cost effective manner. Diesel products sales growth was primarily driven by demand from retrofit markets, although we experienced a softening in Asian retrofit markets in the second half of 2004. Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales or net income for 2004 compared to 2003. The 2004 decline in net income is primarily the result of increased development costs and plant start up costs to support our emerging diesel products. These costs offset the gross margin benefits of increased volumes and the higher mix of premium automotive products. Outlook: We expect sales to increase in 2006. For automotive products, we expect to see stable demand based on anticipated worldwide auto production. Although volumes are anticipated to be stable, a slowdown in auto production, particularly in North America, could adversely impact our growth projections. Diesel product sales are expected to grow as diesel engine manufacturers ramp up production for the 2007 model years. The growth rate of diesel product sales in 2006 is very dependent on the emission standards for heavy duty engines in the United States continuing to be in place. The net loss for the segment is expected to be only slightly lower in 2006 as we continue to spend heavily on research, development and engineering for diesel products. Life Sciences The following table provides net sales and other data for the Life Sciences segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 Net sales $ 282 $ 304 $ 281 (7) 8 Net (loss) income $ (25) $ 12 $ 14 (308) (14) 2005 vs. 2004 The decrease in net sales is due largely to volume decreases as a result of a change in our distribution channel that was made in early 2005. Prior to 2005, approximately 56% of the Life Sciences segment sales were to two distributors, who in turn sold to end users such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government entities, academic institutions and other research facilities. As a result of a change in business strategy by one of the distributors, Corning did not renew the distribution agreement. Approximately 30% of Life Sciences 2004 sales were made through this distributor. We have been successful in transitioning the majority of the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels. As anticipated, however, the change had a negative impact on sales volumes in 2005. Approximately 53% of 2005 sales continued to be made through the remaining primary distributor. The net loss in 2005 was due to lower sales and higher operating expenses to implement the change in distribution channels and to support new product development efforts. Movement in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of this segments net sales or net income for 2005 and 2004. 2004 vs. 2003 The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily due to volume increases across the majority of our product lines. Demand from research, development and production end users remained steady for 2004, which represented an improvement over the industry wide softness experienced in 2003. Movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, did not have a significant impact on sales for 2004 compared to 2003. The 2004 decrease in net income is largely attributable to gross margin improvements resulting from the increase in sales volume being substantially offset by new product development costs. In addition, in 2003 net income benefited from a gain recognized on the disposition of a minor product line. Movement in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income. Outlook: Sales for 2006 are expected to increase modestly as we continue to regain volume and due to price increases in the first quarter of 2006. We expect a lower net loss for 2006 as a result of higher sales and a reduction in operating expenses offset somewhat by a slightly higher level of research, development and engineering spending. Unallocated and Other The following table provides net sales and other data (dollars in millions): % Change 2005 2004 2003 05 vs. 04 04 vs. 03 Conventional video components $ 3 $ 65 (100) (95) Other businesses $ 352 347 247 1 40 Total net sales $ 352 $ 350 $ 312 1 12 Net (loss) income $ (495) $ (834) $ (312) (41) 167 Unallocated and Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting (e.g. Specialty Materials), certain corporate investments (e.g. Dow Corning, Samsung Corning and Steuben), discontinued operations, and unallocated expenses. Unallocated expenses include research and other expenses related to new business development; gains or losses on repurchases and retirement of debt; charges related to the asbestos litigation; restructuring and impairment charges related to the corporate research and development or staff organizations; and charges for increases in our tax valuation allowance. Unallocated and Other also represents the reconciliation between the totals for the reportable segments and our consolidated total. Sales in this segment for 2005 were even with last year. The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily attributable to improvements in our Specialty Materials segment. The decrease in Conventional Video Components sales for 2004 is due to our 2003 decision, along with our partner, to shutdown CAV. Refer to Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and (Credits), Legal Settlement Asbestos, and Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes for a description of the key drivers of net income (loss) for 2005 vs. 2004 and 2004 vs. 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing Activities During 2005, we had a number of significant financing transactions. In separate transactions, we redeemed or repurchased $958 million of debentures for a combination of $579 million cash and 37 million shares of Corning common stock, resulting in an increase to equity of $388 million. We recognized losses totaling $16 million associated with the debt redemptions. In addition, we issued $100 million of senior unsecured notes for proceeds of approximately $99 million and we completed a common stock offering of 20 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $323 million. We also contributed 10 million shares of Corning common stock to our U.S. pension plan resulting in an increase to equity of $199 million. As a result of these transactions, and our operating cash flow in excess of capital expenditures, we ended the year with cash and short term investments in excess of debt on our balance sheet. Refer to Note 11 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements for further information. In the first quarter of 2005 we entered a written agreement with a group of banks on a new revolving credit facility. The new facility provides us access to a $975 million unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit and expires in March 2010. The facility includes two financial covenants, a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, both of which we are in compliance and also includes restrictions on the declaration of dividends. Concurrent with the closing of this credit facility, we terminated our previous $2 billion revolving line of credit that was set to expire in August 2005. Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. Customer deposits have been or will be received in the following periods (in millions): Estimated 2006 2004 2005 and Beyond Total Customer deposits received $204 $457 $278 $939 The majority of the remaining customer deposits will be received through 2006. In 2005, we issued $29 million in credit memoranda. These credit amounts are not included in the above amounts, and were applied against customer receivables. In 2006, we expect to issue credits approximately equal to the amount of deposits expected to be received in 2006. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $1.6 billion, $857 million and $366 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital spending activity in 2005, 2004 and 2003 primarily included expansion of LCD capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2006 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, of which $900 million to $1.1 billion will be to expand manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment. These expenditures primarily relate to previously announced expansion plans for our existing manufacturing facilities in Tainan, Taiwan, Taichung, Taiwan, and Shizuoka, Japan. Additionally, approximately $200 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products. Restructuring During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we made payments of $25 million, $85 million, and $233 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Cash payments for employee related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2007, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010. Key Balance Sheet Data At December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $2.4 billion, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase from December 31, 2004, was primarily due to operating cash flows at $1.9 billion which included $428 million of customer deposits (net of credits issued) offset by $1.6 billion of capital spending. Net financing activities generated cash of approximately $147 million. Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): As of December 31, 2005 2004 Working capital $ 1,644 $ 945 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ (790) $ (936) Current ratio 1.7:1 1.4:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 629 $ 585 Days sales outstanding 49 52 Inventories $ 570 $ 535 Inventory turns 4.7 4.9 Days payable outstanding 89 67 Long term debt $ 1,789 $ 2,214 Total debt to total capital 24% 41% Credit Ratings As of February 17, 2006, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Outlook Last Update Long Term Debt Last Update Fitch BBB Stable April 27, 2005 April 27, 2005 Standard & Poors BBB Stable April 27, 2005 April 27, 2005 Moodys Baa3 Stable September 20, 2005 September 20, 2005 Management Assessment of Liquidity Our major source of funding for 2006 and beyond will be our existing balance of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. From time to time we may also issue debt or equity securities to raise additional cash to fund a portion of our capital expenditures related to our growth businesses. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, restructuring, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity that Corning has an obligation to that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: .. guarantee contracts that require applying the measurement provisions of FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45), and .. variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. FIN 45 requires a company, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. Refer to Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning has variable interests in three variable interest entities from which Corning leases transportation equipment. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in the entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Revised (FIN 46R). The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. We consolidate one variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from a Trust that qualifies as a variable interest entity under FIN 46R. The sole purpose of this entity is leasing transportation equipment to Corning. Since Corning is the primary beneficiary of this entity, the financial statements of the entity are included in Cornings consolidated financial statements. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from two additional Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under FIN 46R. Corning is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. The sole purpose of the entities is leasing transportation equipment to Corning. Corning has been involved with these entities as lessee since the inception of the Trusts. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. SFAS No. 133, paragraph 11(a) states that contracts that are indexed to an entitys own stock and classified in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements are not considered derivative instruments and are therefore excluded from the balance sheet. Although Corning has contracts that are indexed to our own stock, these contracts are not classified within the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are considered derivative instruments and are accounted for as such. Contractual Obligations The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions): Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 5 years and Total 1 year years years years thereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 112 $ 36 $ 2 $ 1 $ 73 Credit facilities for equity companies 165 $ 15 150 Stand by letters of credit (1) 47 47 Loan guarantees 15 15 Subtotal of commitment expirations per period $ 339 $ 83 $ 2 $ 1 $ 15 $ 238 Purchase obligations 219 180 33 2 2 2 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 328 328 Total debt (3) 1,792 18 22 21 169 1,562 Minimum rental commitments 228 39 51 41 19 78 Interest on long term debt (4) 1,185 110 109 109 104 753 Subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period $ 3,752 $ 675 $ 215 $ 173 $ 294 $ 2,395 Total commitments and contingencies $ 4,091 $ 758 $ 217 $ 174 $ 309 $ 2,633 (1) At December 31, 2005, $34 million of the $47 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet. (3) At December 31, 2005, $1,807 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value. (4) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity/expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. We have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning as noted above and discussed in Note 7 (Investments) and Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. Pensions We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2005, this plan accounted for 81% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91% of the related plans assets. In 2004, although global equities had positive returns, interest rates continued to decline. As a result, at December 31, 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets, requiring Corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions." However, in 2005, due primarily to contributions of Corning stock to the domestic qualified pension plan, the fair value of this plans assets at December 31, 2005 exceeded the ABO and, accordingly, Corning eliminated this plans minimum pension liability. Refer to Note 12 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Balances of these non cash adjustments follow (in millions): December 31, 2005 2004 Additional minimum pension liability $ 55 $ 417 Intangible assets 3 42 Other accumulated comprehensive loss, pre tax 52 375 Other accumulated comprehensive loss, after tax 40 273 We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2008. For 2005, we issued and contributed 10 million shares of Corning common stock with a value of approximately $199 million to our domestic pension plan. In 2004, we contributed $40 million to our U.S. pension plan. We anticipate making voluntary contributions of approximately $35 million in cash to our domestic and international pension plans in 2006. ENVIRONMENT We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 11 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. We have accrued approximately $13 million (undiscounted) for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at December 31, 2005. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of goodwill SFAS 142 requires us to make certain difficult, subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, which are the same as our segments. We measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. Telecommunications Results for the Telecommunications segment in 2005 were moderate as pricing in the telecommunications industry continues to decline. We expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable particularly in North America, and fiber volumes to increase modestly and pricing pressures to continue. For our 2005 impairment test, we used a discount rate of 13% in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows. The results of our 2005 tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 12.5% or 13.5%. In 2004, an impairment charge of $1,420 million was recorded. We used a 12.5% discount rate for our 2004 annual impairment test. Had we used a discount rate of 12%, the impairment charge would have been approximately $90 million lower. Had we used a discount rate of 13%, the impairment charge would have been approximately $80 million higher. Terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. Business cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill. The discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of 12 public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. Growth in the Telecommunications segment is dependent upon Cornings success in delivering results in fiber to the premises applications. Increased fiber price pressure or lack of fiber to the premises penetration may precipitate additional goodwill charges in the future. Specialty Materials Our discounted cash flow test for this reporting unit assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. The discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows represents weighed average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of seven public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit. For the 2005 and 2004 impairment tests we used a risk adjusted discount rate of 13% and 12% in our calculation of the fair value of the expected future cash flows, respectively. The results of our 2005 and 2004 tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 12.5% or 13.5% for 2005 and 11.5% or 12.5% for 2004. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In certain circumstances, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Once it has been judged that an impairment has occurred, an impairment assessment requires exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. In 2004, based on our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our outlook for the Telecommunications segment, we determined an event of impairment had occurred in our Telecommunications segment. We performed an impairment test on the segments long lived assets, and recorded a $24 million charge to write down certain assets to their fair value. In 2003, we concluded events of impairment had occurred in our semiconductor materials product line, which is part of the specialty materials segment, and performed an impairment test. The results of our test indicated that our long lived assets held for use were not impaired. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded write downs of property, plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. Assets impaired were primarily equipment, construction in progress and buildings, which were sold or abandoned. We used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment. The estimated salvage values were very low, primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment. The salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves. Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process, especially since we are in a net gross deferred tax asset position, in part due to prior year net operating losses, is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results and the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies. As more fully discussed in Note 6 (Income Taxes), Corning determined that a tax planning strategy considered previously to be prudent was no longer prudent. As such, a $525 million adjustment was recorded in 2005 to increase the valuation allowance to fully reserve our U.S. deferred tax assets. If we sustain an appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Germany, or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies, adjustments to these allowances will be required and may affect future net income. Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," (SFAS 5) requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter, as well as known outcomes in case law. See Legal Proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the PCC asbestos liability. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending ourselves against asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives, and other factors. We have reached a tentative settlement on PCC as disclosed in Legal Proceedings and Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals. Other possible liabilities SFAS 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2005, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,202 million and the minimum pension liability charges to equity with respect to U.S. pension plans was $22 million, net of tax. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Effect on Effect on 2006 December 31, 2005 Change in Assumption Pre Tax Pension Expense PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$4.0 million +$63 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $(4.0) million $62 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$4.8 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $(4.8) million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2005, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $2 million before tax; a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $2 million. With a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate, certain pension plans would become Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) underfunded resulting in a significantly larger impact on equity compared to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Effect on 2006 Effect on Pre Tax OPEB December 31, 2005 Change in Assumption Expense APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$1 million +$24 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $1 million $24 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue Recognition In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts and other factors. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. Stock Compensation Stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk free discount rates, expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and also currently available market place data. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings future stock based compensation expense and disclosures. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financials statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions; tariffs, import duties and currency fluctuations; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; sufficiency of manufacturing capacity and efficiencies; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or major health concerns; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; capital resource and cash flow activities; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand, which may fluctuate; interest costs; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; capital spending; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; stock price fluctuations; the rate of substitution by end users purchasing LCDs for notebook computers, desktop monitors and televisions; a downturn in demand for LCD glass substrates; customer ability, most notably in the Display Technologies segment, to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their manufacturing expansions; fluctuations in supply chain inventory levels; equity company activities, principally at Dow Corning Corporation, Samsung Corning Precision, and Samsung Corning; movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, Euro, and Korean won; and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rate effects includes: .. exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and .. exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is the Japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the Korean won, the Taiwan dollar, and the Euro. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. In 2005, Corning began using derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in the other income, net component in the consolidated statement of operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments was $598 million in 2005 and $443 million in 2004 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 43% of this amount. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $296 million for 2005 and $309 million for 2004. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2005, we had open forward contracts, open option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2005. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $138 million. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $75 million. As we derive approximately 70% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our outlooks included in Managements Discussion and Analysis assume exchange rates during 2006 remain constant at January 2006 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2005 net sales of approximately $200 million and net income of approximately $130 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2005 net sales of approximately $50 million but would have a negligible effect on net income. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our policy prescribes that total variable rate debt will not exceed 35% of the total debt portfolio at anytime. At December 31, 2005, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.
