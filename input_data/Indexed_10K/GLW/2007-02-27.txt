Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our key priorities for 2006 remained unchanged from the previous two years: protect our financial health, improve our profitability, and invest in the future. We made significant progress on all three in 2006. Financial Health In 2006, our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered positive cash flows from operating activities. Significant activities in 2006 included the following: 22 We issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2036 for general corporate purposes and in support of an objective to extend the timing of future debt maturities. We reduced our long term debt in the following transactions: We redeemed $119 million of our 6.25% Euro notes, due in 2010; We repurchased $96 million of our 6.3% notes due in 2009; and We redeemed $125 million of our 8.3% medium term notes due in 2025. We received $171 million in deposits against orders relating to our multi year supply agreements with customers in the Display Technologies segment. These agreements have helped us to meet the rapid growth of the LCD market. All three of our rating agencies upgraded our ratings to either BBB or Baa2. We generated cash flows from operating activities in excess of our capital expenditures. We ended 2006 with $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. This represents an increase of $733 million from December 31, 2005. In November 2006, we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through March 2011. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments. Profitability For the year ended December 31, 2006, we generated net income of $1,855 million or $1.16 per share compared to net income of $585 million or $0.38 per share for 2005. We recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in the past three years which affect the comparability of those years. Refer to Note 3 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)), Note 7 (Income Taxes), and Note 8 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Investing in our future We remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. We are investing in a wide variety of technologies with a focus on glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises. Our research, development and engineering expenditures have increased by $74 million or 17% compared to 2005. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our growth strategies. We also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses. Our capital expenditures are primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment and diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Total capital expenditures for 2006 were $1,182 million, of which $829 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $146 million was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment primarily in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems. We expect our 2007 capital spending to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, of which approximately $700 million will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment and approximately $100 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment. 23 RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): % Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Net sales $ 5,174 $ 4,579 $ 3,854 13 19 Gross margin $ 2,283 $ 1,984 $ 1,415 15 40 (gross margin %) 44% 43% 37% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 857 $ 756 $ 653 13 16 (as a % of revenues) 17% 17% 17% Research, development and engineering expenses $ 517 $ 443 $ 355 17 25 (as a % of revenues) 10% 10% 9% Restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) $ 54 $ (38 ) $ 1,789 (242 ) (102 ) (as a % of revenues) 1% (1)% 46% Asbestos settlement $ (2 ) $ 218 $ 65 (101 ) 235 (as a % of revenues) 0% 5% 2% Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 961 $ 559 $ (1,604 ) 72 (135 ) (as a % of revenues) 19% 12% (42)% Provision for income taxes $ (55 ) $ (578 ) $ (1,084 ) (90 ) (47 ) (as a % of revenues) (1)% (13)% (28)% Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments $ 960 $ 611 $ 454 57 35 (as a % of revenues) 19% 13% 12% Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 1,855 $ 585 $ (2,251 ) 217 (126 ) (as a % of revenues) 36% 13% (58)% Net Sales The net sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of increased demand for LCD glass substrates in our Display Technologies segment and year over year increased volume in the Telecommunications segment. Net sales for all other segments were comparable to the prior year. Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 net sales by approximately $125 million (or 3%) when compared with 2005. The net sales increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of a significant increase in demand for LCD glass substrates in our Display Technologies segment. Modest gains in demand for products in our Telecommunications segment to support fiber to the premises projects and in our Environmental Technologies segment also contributed to the sales increase. The impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on 2005 net sales was less than 1% when compared with net sales in 2004. Reflecting the growth in our Display Technologies segment, net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the U.S. market. For 2006, 2005, and 2004, sales into international markets accounted for 71%, 71%, and 65% of net sales, respectively. Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. 24 Gross Margin As a percentage of net sales, 2006 gross margin was up slightly from 2005 driven primarily by our Display Technologies segment. Gross margins for this segment were essentially even with 2005 reflecting the negative impact of price declines offset by higher volumes and cost reductions. Display Technologies segment sales increased from 38% of total Cornings sales in 2005 to 41% of Cornings sales in 2006. As Display Technologies has a higher gross margin than our consolidated gross margin, the added concentration in Display Technologies in 2006 caused Cornings gross margin percentage to increase from 43% in 2005 to 44% in 2006. For 2005, as a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved 6 percentage points versus 2004. The improvement was driven by increased volume, improved mix of large generation glass and manufacturing efficiencies in our Display Technologies segment. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 compared to 2005, in dollars, was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), effective January 1, 2006. The increase in spending in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily driven by increases in compensation costs. As a percent of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses were comparable for all periods presented. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. Share Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for share based awards granted under the Companys stock compensation programs using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Under the intrinsic value method, no share based compensation cost related to stock options had been recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of operations, because the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date. As a result, the recognition of share based compensation cost was generally limited to the expense attributed to restricted stock awards, and stock option modifications. As permitted under SFAS 123, the Company reported pro forma disclosures presenting results and earnings per share as if we had used the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method. Under the modified prospective application method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. In accordance with the modified prospective application method, results for prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in a decrease of $0.05 in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. See Note 18 (Share based Compensation) to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the impact of SFAS 123(R). 25 Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $74 million in 2006 when compared to 2005, but remained consistent as a percentage of net sales. Expenditures in 2006 were focused on our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments as we looked to capitalize on market opportunities in those segments. Expenses in 2006 also included costs associated with exploratory projects to support future growth. Expenditures increased in 2005 when compared to 2004, due to increased spending to support growth initiatives including glass substrates for LCDs, diesel filter and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, as well as exploratory projects. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded significant net charges in 2004 which affect the comparability of our results for 2006, 2005, and 2004. A summary of the net charges and credits for all years presented is provided in the following table (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Impairment of goodwill $ 1,420 Impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment $ (2 ) $ 6 302 Assets to be held and used 50 24 Reversal of currency translation adjustment (84 ) Accelerated depreciation 37 Loss on sale of businesses 12 Impairment of available for sale securities 25 Restructuring charges and (credits) 6 15 (6 ) Total restructuring, impairment other charges and (credits) $ 54 $ (38 ) $ 1,789 Impairment of Goodwill 2004 Impairment Charge Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142) goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level. In addition, goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value. In the third quarter of 2004, we identified certain factors that caused us to lower our estimates and projections for the long term revenue growth of the Telecommunications segment, which indicated that the fair value of the Telecommunications segment reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We performed an interim impairment test of the Telecommunications segment goodwill in the third quarter of 2004 and, as a result, recorded an impairment charge of $1,420 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value at September 30, 2004 of $117 million. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill Given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing certain of our businesses, at various times throughout 2004 to 2006, we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our held for use long lived assets other than goodwill. When an impairment evaluation was required, we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated. If our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows, we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets, limited to property, plant and equipment, using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. 26 2006 Impairment Charge Assets to be held and used In 2006, we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of $44 million to impair certain long lived assets of our Telecommunications segment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Due to our lowered long term outlook for this business, we determined that an event of impairment, as defined by SFAS 144, had occurred in that business, which further required us to test this asset group for impairment. We assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. As a result of our impairment evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value. 2004 Impairment Charge Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment These charges comprise the following: Telecommunications segment: In 2004, we recorded a net charge of $344 million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to be disposed of or shutdown. Approximately $332 million of this net charge was comprised of the partially completed sections of our Concord, N.C. optical fiber facility. As a result of our lowered outlook, we have permanently abandoned this construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the investment necessary to complete this facility. We have mothballed and will continue to depreciate the separate previously operated portion of the Concord fiber facility. Other businesses: We recorded net credits of $42 million, primarily for gains on the sale of assets Corning Asahi Video Products (CAV) sold to a third party in China. This represented proceeds in excess of assumed salvage values for assets previously impaired. This represented the substantial completion of the sale of CAVs assets. Assets to be held and used In 2004, due to our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our long term outlook for the Telecommunications segment in 2004, we determined that an event of impairment had occurred in our Telecommunications segment which required us to test the segments long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment. As a result of this impairment evaluation, we recorded a $24 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2004 to write down certain assets to fair value. Other Credits 2005 Reversal of Currency Translation Adjustment In 2003, Corning sold its photonic business operations to Avanex. The photonics business was the sole operation of Corning O.T.I. S.r.l. (OTI), a wholly owned Italian subsidiary of Corning, whose results were included in Cornings Telecommunications segment. Subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of OTI to Avanex, Corning began liquidating OTI. In October 2005, the assets of OTI were determined to be substantially liquidated. As a result of the substantial liquidation, OTIs cumulative translation account was reversed, resulting in a gain of $84 million in the fourth quarter. 27 Accelerated Depreciation 2004 Accelerated Depreciation We recorded $37 million of accelerated depreciation relating to the final shutdown of our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2003. Loss on Sale of Businesses 2004 Loss on Sale of Business On September 1, 2004 we completed the sale of our frequency controls business, which was part of the Telecommunications segment, for net cash proceeds of $80 million. We recorded a loss on the sale of $14 million, which included an allocation of $30 million of the Telecommunications segment goodwill. Impairment of Available for Sale Securities 2005 Impairment Charge In 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $25 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in Avanex Corporation (Avanex) below its adjusted cost basis. Our investment in Avanex was accounted for as an available for sale security under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our shares of Avanex. Restructuring Actions 2005 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $15 million in 2005 which included the following: A charge of $30 million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment. Net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling $15 million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of Corning Asahi Video Products and to our specialty materials business. Legal Settlement Asbestos On March 28, 2003, we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on a settlement arrangement that was thereafter incorporated into the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) plan of reorganization (the PCC Plan). This settlement remains subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the Bankruptcy Court. If the PCC Plan is approved and becomes effective, our settlement will require Corning to relinquish its equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. The common stock and other components of the settlement will be marked to market each quarter until the PCC Plan is approved, thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate. Corning will also make cash payments of $140 million (net present value of $131 million at March 2003) in six installments beginning one year after the plan is effective. In addition, we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement. Two of Cornings primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation. 28 The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to consider objections to the PCC Plan were held in the Bankruptcy Court in May 2004. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court requested that the PCC Plan proponents delete references to Section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and resubmit the PCC Plan. The final round of oral argument was held on July 21, 2006. On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the PCC Plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, have filed motions for reconsideration, which are scheduled for a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court on March 5, 2007. If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve the PCC Plan in its current form, changes to the PCC Plan are probable as it is likely that the Court will allow the proponents time to propose amendments. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain, and confirmation of the current Plan or any amended Plan is subject to a number of contingencies. However, apart from the quarterly mark to market adjustment in the value of the 25 million shares of Corning stock, management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. The following summarizes the charges and gains we have recorded for the asbestos settlement (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 Initial settlement charge $ 392 Fair market value adjustment for other components $ 22 $ 21 $ 32 28 Mark to market common stock (24 ) 197 33 115 Asbestos settlement $ (2 ) $ 218 $ 65 $ 535 See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter. Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes In addition to the items identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) and Asbestos Settlement, we retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during 2006, 2005 and 2004, that resulted in losses of $11 million, $16 million, and $36 million, respectively. Movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted income (loss) from continuing operations in 2006 and 2005 when compared to the respective previous years. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax (benefit) rates were as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Provision for income taxes $ 55 $ 578 $ 1,084 Effective income tax rate 5.7 % 103.4 % 67.6 % The effective income tax rate for 2006 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The impact of not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The release of valuation allowances on all Australian deferred tax assets and on a portion of our deferred tax assets in Germany; and The benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions. In 2004 and 2005 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire U.S. deferred tax assets because we incurred significant losses in the U.S. in recent years. As a result, our tax provision in these years has included only the net tax expense attributable to certain foreign operations. While we did generate income from continuing operations in the U.S. in 2006, such income was largely offset by tax adjustments not reflected in our continuing operations. In the absence of an appropriate level of overall profitability in the U.S., we did not record tax expense on income from continuing operations in the U.S. in 2006, resulting in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 14.2%. 29 In 2004, we also recorded valuation allowances against most of our foreign deferred tax assets. In 2006, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in both Australia and at certain of our German operations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the underlying tax benefits are realizable and released valuation allowances, resulting in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 8.7%. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China, South Africa and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years (2006 to 2010) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 10.1%, 8.9%, and 1.2% for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays, the effective income tax rate for: 2005 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to tax expense of $525 million to increase Cornings valuation allowance. 2004 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to establishing a valuation allowance against certain domestic (U.S. federal, state and local) and foreign deferred tax assets, and the write off of nondeductible goodwill. In 2004, significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation allowances against certain U.S. and German deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate of 78.9%. Refer to Note 3 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)) for additional information on these events and the related charges. At that time, we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $525 million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in Dow Corning, a non strategic appreciated asset, if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards. During 2005, Dow Cornings performance was much stronger than expected and Dow Corning resumed paying a dividend; both of which are expected to continue in the future. Due to this improved performance, we concluded that Dow Corning provides strong financial, geographic and market balance to Cornings portfolio of businesses, the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment. As a result, we considered Dow Corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of Dow Corning would be prudent, as required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Therefore, we no longer believed, in the fourth quarter of 2005, that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we increased our valuation allowance by $525 million to fully reserve our net U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005, which increased our effective tax rate by 94%. During the third quarter of 2005, Corning filed its 2004 consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return, which included a $3.9 billion worthless stock deduction for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the Pirelli acquisition. This acquisition was completed in December 2000 and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of 2001. Prior to the third quarter of 2005, we did not record a deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate realization of such deduction was uncertain, and consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, recognition of an asset prior to the time management determines the realization of the asset is probable is prohibited. On September 2, 2005, Corning and the Commissioner of the IRS entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which provides that Corning is entitled to this worthless stock deduction. We recorded a $1.5 billion deferred tax asset for this item in the third quarter, which was concurrently offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount due to our inability to record tax benefits for U.S. net operating losses. The net result had no impact of our effective tax rate for 2005. 30 Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Samsung Corning Precision $ 555 $ 408 $ 277 Dow Corning 334 253 116 Samsung Corning (112 ) 32 All other 71 62 29 Total equity earnings $ 960 $ 611 $ 454 The 2006 and 2005 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Corning Precision and at Dow Corning. In addition to the above, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits: In 2006, Dow Corning reached settlement with the IRS regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003. Equity earnings reflected a $33 million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all Federal tax issues related to Dow Cornings implant settlement. In 2006, Samsung Corning recorded the following items which increased Cornings equity earnings by $2 million, net: a gain on the sale of land which increased Cornings equity earnings by $61 million; an impairment charge on certain long lived assets which reduced Cornings equity earnings by $46 million; and the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets which reduced Cornings equity earnings by $13 million. In 2005, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube (CRT) glass business. The charge, which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs, reduced Cornings equity earnings by $106 million in the third quarter. In 2005, Dow Corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock. Cornings equity earnings included $11 million related to this gain. In 2004, Corning incurred charges of $35 million to impaire quity method investments in the Telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value. In 2004, Dow Corning recorded charges related to restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded on its emergence from bankruptcy. Cornings equity earnings included $21 million related to these charges. In 2003, 2005, and 2006, Samsung Corning recorded significant fixed asset and other impairment charges. As the conventional television glass market will be negatively impacted by strong growth in the LCD glass market, it is reasonably possible that Samsung Corning may incur additional restructuring or impairment charges or operating losses in the foreseeable future. Samsung Corning is currently investing in several developing businesses which Samsung Corning management believes will offset the decline in conventional television glass market over time. Should these new businesses not achieve expected results, additional operating losses, asset impairments and restructuring charges are likely to occur and Samsung Cornings long term financial viability may come into question. These events could result in Corning incurring an impairment of its investment in Samsung Corning. Corning management believes it is more likely than not that an impairment of our investment will occur in the foreseeable future. Cornings investment in Samsung Corning was $254 million at December 31, 2006. 31 Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations As a result of the items discussed above, the income (loss) from continuing operations and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 1,855 $ 585 $ (2,251 ) Basic earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations $ 1.20 $ 0.40 $ (1.62 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations $ 1.16 $ 0.38 $ (1.62 ) Shares used in computing basic per share amounts 1,550 1,464 1,386 Shares used in computing diluted per share amounts 1,594 1,535 1,386 RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In the third quarter of 2004, Corning and 3M reached a final settlement agreement for funds held in escrow associated with the 2002 sale of Cornings precision lens business to 3M. As a result, we recognized a $20 million gain upon receipt of the proceeds in 2004. OPERATING SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments include Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. The Environmental Technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments, as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. The following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment: Display Technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays; Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry; Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications; and Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include interest, taxes and corporate functions. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2006, Corning changed its measurement of segment profit or loss as follows: We removed the net impact of financing costs, such as interest expense on debt instruments and interest costs associated with benefit plans, from reportable segments and included these amounts in Corporate unallocated expense. We changed the allocation method for taxes to more closely reflect the Companys current tax position. We removed the impact of non cash stock compensation expense from reportable segments and included this amount in Corporate unallocated expense. 32 We removed the allocation of exploratory research, development and engineering expense from reportable segments and included these amounts in Corporate unallocated expense. We changed certain other allocation methods for corporate functions. The following discussion reflects segment information that has been revised to reflect the changes to segment performance measurement as described above. Display Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Display Technologies segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Net sales $ 2,133 $ 1,742 $ 1,113 22 57 Income before equity earnings $ 1,052 $ 823 $ 429 28 92 Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 565 $ 416 $ 288 36 44 Net income $ 1,617 $ 1,239 $ 717 31 73 2006 vs. 2005 The net sales increase for 2006 continues to reflect overall LCD glass market growth. During 2006, glass substrate volumes (measured in square feet of glass sold) increased 52% compared with 2005, driven by increased LCD monitor and TV market penetration, demand for larger size substrates (generation 5 and above), and continued strong demand for glass for notebook computers. Sales of large size glass substrates, which carry a slightly higher selling price per square foot, accounted for 82% of 2006 sales volumes compared to 69% in 2005. The growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 16%. Sales of the Display Technologies segment are denominated primarily in the Japanese yen. Movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted 2006 sales by approximately $122 million (or 7%) when compared with 2005. In the second quarter of 2006, the Display Technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of 2001. The lower volume was the result of a number of our customers, primarily in Taiwan, idling part of their facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass, as a result of a build up of panel inventory in the supply chain. In comparison to the second quarter of 2006, both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of 2006. As expected, our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up LCD panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand expected in the fourth quarter. For 2006, the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes as described above and manufacturing cost reductions, offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates. Movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 income before equity earnings by approximately 5% when compared with 2005. The increase in our equity earnings, primarily from Samsung Corning Precision, was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned business except that the impact of the panel maker inventory build in Korea in the second quarter of 2006 was not as significant. In 2006, Samsung Corning Precisions earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 8% from movements in exchange rates compared to 2005. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollarJapanese yen and U.S. dollarKorean won exchange rates. The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. On October 1, 2006, AU Optronics Corporation (AUO), a customer of the Display Technologies segment, completed its previously announced merger with Quanta Display Inc. (QDI), another customer of Cornings Display Technologies segment. In addition, through two subsequent transactions, AUO now holds a 49% equity stake in Toppan CFI, a subsidiary of Toppan Printing Co., Ltd., also a customer of the Display Technologies segment. As a result of these transactions, AUO, QDI, and Toppan CFI are considered to be a single customer reported as AUO. For 2006, AUO (including QDI and Toppan CFI), Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, and Sharp Corporation, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 64% of total segment sales when combined. 33 In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2006, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and LG Phillips LCD Co., Ltd. accounted for approximately 92% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales. In 2005 and 2004, Corning and several customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which the Display Technologies segment agreed to supply large size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. In 2006, Corning received $171 million of customer deposits and issued $126 million in credit memoranda. Refer to Note 11 (Other Liabilities) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In the event the customers do not make all customer deposit installment payments or elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits. In the ordinary course of business, Corning will continue to negotiate multi year supply agreements with its large customers where feasible but we believe it is unlikely that we will negotiate agreements that require additional deposits. Corning is investing heavily to expand capacity to meet increasing demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2006, capital spending was $829 million and is expected to be approximately $700 million in 2007. Capital spending in 2007 will be used primarily to expand manufacturing facilities in Taichung, Taiwan and Shizuoka, Japan. 2005 vs. 2004 The 2005 sales increase reflected the overall growth of the LCD glass substrate market. During 2005, glass substrate volumes increased approximately 64% compared with 2004. For 2005, large size glass substrates accounted for 69% of total sales volumes, compared to 46% in 2004. Movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales. For 2005, the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were higher volumes, ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, and a lower effective tax rate. Movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings. The increase in our equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision was largely driven by higher volumes and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. Outlook:We expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for LCD televisions. We anticipate the volume growth in the LCD glass market to be in the mid 30% range in 2007. The expected market volume growth, measured in square feet, for the year should be equal to or greater than the volume growth in the market in 2006. Cornings LCD glass volume is expected to grow at the upper end of this range, while Samsung Corning Precisions volume growth may be slightly lower. Growth rates by region for the industry generally, and thus for Cornings wholly owned business and Samsung Corning Precision, may be different based on market dynamics. We believe prices will decline in 2007 but not to the extent that we experienced in 2006. We also expect to be able to reduce our manufacturing costs to address the impact of price declines. We expect price declines of 1 2% in the first quarter of 2007 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. 34 As glass for LCD television becomes a higher percentage of total LCD glass demand, we anticipate that our business will become more seasonal. We currently anticipate that glass volume will decline 10 15% in the first quarter from the seasonally strong fourth quarter of 2006 and that sales and earnings in this segment will be more concentrated in the second half of 2007 than in prior years. Although we believe that end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks remains strong, we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions and political tensions could have on consumer demand. There is no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years, that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand, or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period. While the industry has grown rapidly, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes; prices; or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. Telecommunications The following table provides net sales and other data for the Telecommunications segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 877 $ 834 $ 755 5 10 Hardware and equipment 852 789 784 8 1 Total net sales $ 1,729 $ 1,623 $ 1,539 7 5 Net income (loss) $ 7 $ 68 $ (1,874 ) (90 ) (104 ) 2006 vs. 2005 Increases in Telecommunications segment net sales were driven by improved sales in North America, Europe and China. The increase was driven by a broader recovery in the Telecommunications industry, including greater deployment of fiber to the premises products and growth in the private network market. The volume increase was offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to 2005. Movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segments net sales, primarily the Euro and Japanese yen, did not have a significant impact on sales in 2006 when compared to the previous year. Effective April 1, 2006, ACS, an equity company affiliate, assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in Japan. As a result, sales in 2006 were negatively impacted as ACS, which is accounted for under the equity method, began to sell into the Japanese market. Sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in Japan, which are now recorded by an equity affiliate, were $75 million in 2005 and $23 million in the first quarter of 2006. In 2006, we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of $44 million to impair certain long lived assets of our cabling business in accordance with SFAS 144. Due to our lowered long term outlook for this business, we determined that an event of impairment, as defined by SFAS 144, had occurred, which further required us to test this asset group for impairment. We assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using the expected cash flows discounted cash flow approach as a measure of fair value associated with these assets. As a result of our impairment evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value. For the Telecommunications segment, net income in 2006 and 2005 was impacted by restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits. In 2006, we recorded an after tax impairment charge of $44 million, described above. In 2005, we recorded net after tax credits of $47 million. Refer to Results of Continuing Operations for a discussion of these charges. The decline in net income for this segment in 2006 when compared to 2005 was primarily the result of the 2006 impairment charge described above and the absence of net after tax credits of $47 million that were recorded in 2005. Movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact the results for this operating segment. 35 The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2006, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales, accounted for 25% of total segment sales when combined. 2005 vs. 2004 Results for the Telecommunications segment reflected a solid performance in 2005. The net sales increase was largely driven by sales in North America and Europe. Excluding the impact of the frequency controls business, a hardware and equipment manufacturer sold in September 2004, net sales for the Telecommunications segment increased 10% in 2005 when compared to the previous year. Movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact sales for either 2005 or 2004. For the Telecommunications segment, net income in 2005 and the net loss in 2004 were impacted by restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits. In 2005, we recorded net after tax credits of $47 million related to these items and in 2004, we recorded after tax charges of $1,798 million. Refer to Results of Continuing Operations for a detailed discussion of these charges. Outlook:For the Telecommunications segment, we expect sales and earnings to increase in 2007, reflecting a broader based increase in demand than in the last two years. However, sales will still be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer. Changes in our customers expected deployment plan, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect the sales level. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. Environmental Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Environmental Technologies segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Net sales: Automotive $ 451 $ 482 $ 479 (6 ) 1 Diesel 164 98 69 67 42 Total net sales $ 615 $ 580 $ 548 6 6 Net income $ 7 $ 15 $ 21 (53 ) (29 ) 2006 vs. 2005 Sales of this segment in 2006 were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in Diesel products sales, primarily for light duty diesel vehicle applications. However, we also experienced a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes. As end customers shift demand toward smaller, more energy efficient vehicles, demand for larger automobiles has declined. This shift in demand has caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles. In addition, volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller substrates. Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment. The decrease in net income in 2006 versus 2005 was due primarily to increased research, development, and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products. 36 2005 vs. 2004 The 2005 increase in net sales was the result of continued growth in diesel products sales. For automotive products, sales in 2005 were flat when compared to prior year. The 2005 decrease in net income compared to 2004 resulted primarily from increased operating expenses primarily to support our emerging diesel products. Movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment in 2005 when compared to 2004. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. In 2006, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 72% of total segment sales. Outlook:We expect both sales and earnings improvements in the Environmental Technologies segment in 2007. Automotive substrate sales are expected to remain even with 2006 levels. Diesel products sales are expected to increase more than 60% in 2007 as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards became effective in the U.S. on January 1, 2007. Segment profitability is expected to increase due to higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions. Changes in automotive production could adversely impact sales and net income of this segment. Life Sciences The following table provides net sales and other data for the Life Sciences segment (dollars in millions): % Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Net sales $ 287 $ 282 $ 304 2 (7 ) Net (loss) income $ (17 ) $ (4 ) $ 16 325 (125 ) 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales of the Life Sciences segment were up slightly in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the U.S. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales. The segment continues to operate at a loss due to significant research, development, and engineering spending related to the Epic System, a high throughput label free screening platform based on optical biosensor technology, which had its market launch in 2006. The segment loss also includes $5 million of severance, curtailment, and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the United Kingdom. In the Life Sciences segment, one customer accounted for approximately 43% of this segments net sales in 2006. 2005 vs. 2004 The decrease in net sales in 2005 when compared to 2004 was due to volume decreases as a result of a change in our distribution channel that was made in early 2005. Prior to 2005, approximately 56% of the Life Sciences segment sales were to two distributors, who in turn sold to end users such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government entities, academic institutions and other research facilities. As a result of a change in business strategy by one of the distributors, Corning did not renew the distribution agreement. Approximately 30% of Life Sciences 2004 sales were made through this distributor. As expected, the change had a negative impact on sales volumes in 2005. 37 The net loss in 2005 was due to lower sales and higher operating expenses to implement the change in distribution channels and to support new product development efforts. Movement in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of this segments net sales or net income for 2005 and 2004. Outlook:Sales for 2007 are expected to increase slightly over 2006. We expect a lower net loss for 2007 as a result of higher sales and the absence of severance and curtailment charges. Unallocated and Other The following table provides net sales and other data (dollars in millions): % Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Other businesses net sales $ 410 $ 352 $ 350 16 1 Net income (loss) $ 47 $ (66 ) $ 50 (171 ) (232 ) Unallocated and Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting. Sales in this segment for 2006 were higher than last year due to increased sales in the Specialty Materials business. Net income for 2006 and net loss for 2005 reflected the impact of impairment and other charges and credits recorded by Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. In 2006 and 2005, Cornings share of these items was a credit of $2 million and a charge of $106 million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing Activities During 2006, we had a number of significant financing transactions as follows: We redeemed the entire $125 million principal amount of our 8.3% medium term notes due April 4, 2025, which, at the redemption date, had a book value of $129 million. We redeemed $119 million of our 6.25% Euro notes due February 18, 2010. We recognized a loss of $8 million upon the early redemption of these notes. We repurchased $96 million principal amount of our 6.3% notes due March 1, 2009. We recognized a loss of $3 million upon the repurchase of these notes. We issued $250 million of 7.25% senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately $246 million for general corporate purposes and in support of an objective to extend the timing of future debt maturities.Although the notes mature on August 15, 2036, we can redeem or repurchase them at any time. Refer to Note 12 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements for further information. In November 2006, we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through March 2011. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. 38 Customer deposits have been or will be received in the following periods (in millions): Estimated 2005 2006 2007 Total Customer deposits received $ 457 $ 171 $ 105 $ 733 In 2006 and 2005, we issued $126 million and $29 million, respectively, in credit memoranda. These credit amounts are not included in the above amounts and were applied against customer receivables. In 2007, we expect to issue credits in the range of $250 million to $300 million. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $857 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2007 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, with approximately $700 million used to expand manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment. Additionally, approximately $100 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products. Restructuring During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we made payments of $15 million, $25 million, and $85 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Cash payments for employee related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2007, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010. Key Balance Sheet Data At December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $3.2 billion, compared with $2.4 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase from December 31, 2005, was primarily due to operating cash flows of $1.8 billion. Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): As of December 31, 2006 2005 Working capital $ 2,479 $ 1,490 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ (688 ) $ (944 ) Current ratio 2.1:1 1.6:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 746 $ 629 Days sales outstanding 48 49 Inventories $ 639 $ 570 Inventory turns 4.6 4.7 Days payable outstanding 81 89 Long term debt $ 1,696 $ 1,789 Total debt to total capital 19% 25% 39 Credit Ratings As of February 26, 2007, our credit ratings were as follows: Rating Outlook RATING AGENCY Long Term Debt Last Update Fitch BBB Stable April 26, 2006 Standard & Poors BBB Stable April 10, 2006 Moodys Baa2 Stable July 17, 2006 Management Assessment of Liquidity Our major source of funding for 2007 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. From time to time, we may issue debt securities to refinance debt securities maturing in the next few years. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, restructuring, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures, and scheduled debt repayments. Due to the significant increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments over the past few years, during 2007 we will evaluate further reductions in our long term debt, share repurchases, and dividends. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45), and variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. FIN 45 requires a company, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Revised (FIN 46R). The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by FIN 46R. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. 40 Corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities, and as required by FIN 46R the financial statements of the entity are included in Cornings consolidated financial statements. Corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such, FIN 46R does not require Corning to include them in its consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity. In the reporting year 2005 and prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), Corning had employee compensation awards (stock options) that were excluded from the balance sheet. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS No. 133provides an exception to this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entitys own stock and classified in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), employee stock option awards were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph 11(a) criteria. In 2006, those options are recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. In 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006, we had other non employee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph 11(a). Those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods. Contractual Obligations The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions): Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 5 years and Total 1 year years years years thereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 70 $ 14 $ 5 $ 1 $ 1 $ 49 Credit facilities for equity companies 177 16 161 Stand by letters of credit (1) 73 63 10 Loan guarantees 14 1 13 Subtotal of commitment expirations per period $ 334 $ 78 $ 15 $ 17 $ 1 $ 223 Purchase obligations 161 74 30 26 22 9 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 261 261 Total debt (3) 1,707 20 20 72 297 1,298 Minimum rental commitments 286 62 66 28 24 106 Interest on long term debt (4) 1,390 106 105 103 101 975 Subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period $ 3,805 $ 523 $ 221 $ 229 $ 444 $ 2,388 Total commitments and contingencies $ 4,139 $ 601 $ 236 $ 246 $ 445 $ 2,611 (1) At December 31, 2006, $35 million of the $73 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet. (3) At December 31, 2006, $1,716 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value. (4) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity/expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. 41 We have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning as noted above and discussed in Note 8 (Investments) and Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. Pensions We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2006, this plan accounted for 79% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 90% of the related plans assets. At December 31, 2004, the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets, requiring Corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). However, in 2005, due primarily to contributions of Corning stock to the domestic qualified pension plan, the fair value of this plans assets at December 31, 2005 exceeded the ABO and, accordingly, Corning eliminated this plans minimum pension liability. At December 31, 2006, Corning adopted SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of $669 million after tax. Dow Cornings adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in Dow Corning and a decrease to stockholders equity of $94 million after tax. Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2008. For 2006, we did not make any contributions to our pension plans. For 2005, we issued and contributed 10 million shares of Corning common stock with a value of approximately $199 million to our domestic pension plan. We anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately $100 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2007. ENVIRONMENT We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 18 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had accrued approximately $16 million (undiscounted) and $13 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. 42 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of goodwill SFAS 142 requires us to make certain difficult, subjective, and complex judgments on a number of matters, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process that runs from June to October. This process includes reviewing expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows. We measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. Telecommunications Results for the Telecommunications segment in 2006 were moderate, as pricing in the telecommunications industry continues to decline. We expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable, fiber volumes to increase modestly, and pricing pressures to continue. The results of our impairment tests in 2006 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value. A discount rate of 13% was used in both 2005 to 2006. Our conclusion would not have changed had we used a discount rate of 12.5% or 13.5%. Specialty Materials The results of our impairment tests in 2006 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value. A discount rate of 12% was used in 2006 and 13% was used in 2005. We determined a range of discount rates between 11.5% and 13.5% would not have affected our conclusion. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In certain circumstances, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. 43 Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. During 2004, we recorded write downs of property, plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications segment. Assets impaired were primarily equipment, construction in progress and buildings, which were sold or abandoned. We used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment. The estimated salvage values were very low, primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment. The salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves. Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results and the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. If we sustain an appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Germany, or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies, adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income. Refer to Note 7 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements. Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS 5) requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case specific issues. See Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the PCC asbestos liability. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives. We have reached a tentative plan of settlement on PCC as disclosed in Legal Proceedings and Note 8 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals. On December 21, 2006, the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the PCC Plan of Reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from PCCs products or operations. Several parties, including Corning, have moved for reconsideration of the ruling. We continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling, or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claim deriving from PCC. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. Other possible liabilities SFAS 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. 44 Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2006, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,237 million. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Effect on Effect on 2007 December 31, 2006 Change in Assumption Pre Tax Pension Expense PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5.4 million +$63 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $6.0 million $62 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$5.1 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $5.1 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2006, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $85 million before tax, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $84 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Effect on 2007 Effect on Pre Tax OPEB December 31, 2006 Change in Assumption Expense APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$1 million +$22 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $1 million $22 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue Recognition In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. 45 Stock Compensation Stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk free discount rates, expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and currently available market place data. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings future stock based compensation expense and disclosures. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financials statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, forecasts, and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions; tariffs, import duties and currency fluctuations; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or major health concerns; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand, which may fluctuate; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; stock price fluctuations; customer acceptance of LCD televisions; a downturn in demand or decline in growth rates for LCD glass substrates; customer ability, most notably in the Display Technologies segment, to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their manufacturing expansions; fluctuations in supply chain inventory levels; equity company activities, principally at Dow Corning Corporation, Samsung Corning Precision, and Samsung Corning; movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, Euro, and Korean won; and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. 46 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates have the following effects: exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is the Japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the Korean won, the Taiwan dollar, and the Euro. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in the other income, net component in the consolidated statement of operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments was $960 million in 2006 and $611 million in 2005 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 65% of this amount in 2006. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $555 million for 2006 and $296 million for 2005. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2006, we had open forward contracts, open option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2006. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $113 million. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $39 million. As we derive approximately 70% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our outlooks included in Managements Discussion and Analysis assume exchange rates during 2007 remain constant at January 2007 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2006 net sales of approximately $200 million and net income of approximately $140 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2006 net sales of approximately $60 million but would have a negligible effect on net income. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our policy prescribes that total variable rate debt will not exceed 35% of the total debt portfolio at anytime. At December 31, 2006, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments. 47
