Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our key priorities for 2007 remained unchanged from the previous three years: protect our financial health, improve our profitability, and invest in the future. We made significant progress on these in 2007. Financial Health In 2007, our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities. Significant items in 2007 included the following: In the first quarter, we repurchased $223 million of our 6.25% Euro notes due in 2010. In the second quarter, all three of our rating agencies upgraded our debt ratings to BBB+ or the equivalent. Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion which was significantly greater than our $1.3 billion of capital spending. In the third quarter of 2007, we began paying dividends on the Companys common stock. We repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for $250 million as part of a repurchase program announced in the second quarter. We ended 2007 with $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. This represents an increase of $349 million from December 31, 2006. Our revolving credit facility, amended in November 2006, provides committed access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through March 2011. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and our stock repurchase program. Profitability For the year ended December 31, 2007, we generated net income of $2.2 billion or $1.34 per share compared to net income of $1.9 billion or $1.16 per share for 2006. The improvement in net income was due largely to the following items: Higher net income in the Display Technologies segment driven by strong sales volumes and an increase in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision when compared to 2006. Higher net income in the Telecommunications segment primarily due to market growth for telecommunications products and the absence of an impairment charge, which totaled $44 million in 2006. Higher net income in the Environmental Technologies segment due to strong sales of automotive and diesel products. The increase in net income was offset by asbestos settlement expense of $185 million in 2007 compared to a credit of $2 million in 2006 reflecting the change in the settlement value of Cornings asbestos settlement liability. The change in the settlement value of this liability was primarily attributable to the change in the value of 25 million shares of Cornings common stock to be contributed to the proposed settlement. Net income was also negatively impacted by restructuring, impairment, and other charges at Samsung Corning. Our share of these charges in 2007 was $40 million. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these items. Investing in our future We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems. We remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. In 2007, approximately one third of our total research, development and engineering expenditures were for research. This spending related to our existing businesses, new business development, exploratory research, and early stage marketing. We continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises. We are also making increased investments in new technologies such as the Epic system, synthetic green lasers, silicon on glass, and microreactors. Our research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $48 million in 2007 when compared to 2006 but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. 22 We also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses. Our capital expenditures were primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment and diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Total capital expenditures for 2007 were $1.3 billion, of which $883 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $67 million was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment. In addition, in April 2007, we announced a $300 million facility improvement plan for the Companys Sullivan Park Research and Development campus near Corning, New York. The expansion is expected to be completed over a six year period. We expect our 2008 capital spending to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, of which approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment. In December 2007, we announced a 5 year capital expenditure plan of $795 million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporations plant in Sakai City, Japan. Production from this new facility is expected to meet Sharp Corporations plan to begin production of LCD panels for large televisions by March 2010. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. The range provided for 2008 for our Display Technologies segment includes some spending for recently announced projects. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 % Change 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Net sales $ 5,860 $ 5,174 $ 4,579 13 13 Gross margin $ 2,749 $ 2,283 $ 1,984 20 15 (gross margin %) 47% 44% 43% Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 912 $ 857 $ 756 6 13 (as a % of revenues) 16% 17% 17% Research, development and engineering expenses $ 565 $ 517 $ 443 9 17 (as a % of revenues) 10% 10% 10% Restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) $ (4) $ 54 $ (38) (107 ) (242 ) (as a % of revenues) 0% 1% (1)% Asbestos settlement $ 185 $ (2) $ 218 (9,350 ) (101 ) (as a % of revenues) 3% 0% 5% Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,291 $ 961 $ 559 34 72 (as a % of revenues) 22% 19% 12% Provision for income taxes $ (80) $ (55) $ (578) 45 (90 ) (as a % of revenues) (1)% (1)% (13)% Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments $ 942 $ 960 $ 611 (2 ) 57 (as a % of revenues) 16% 19% 13% Net income $ 2,150 $ 1,855 $ 585 16 217 (as a % of revenues) 37% 36% 13% Net Sales The net sales increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily the result of increased volumes in the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, and Telecommunications segments. For those three segments, sales volume increases were offset somewhat by price declines. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2007 net sales when compared with last year. 23 The net sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of increased demand for LCD glass substrates in our Display Technologies segment and year over year increased volume in the Telecommunications segment. Net sales for all other segments were comparable to the prior year. Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 net sales by approximately $125 million (or 3%) when compared with 2005. Reflecting the growth in our Display Technologies segment, net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the U.S. market. For 2007, sales into international markets accounted for 72% of net sales. For 2006 and 2005, sales into international markets accounted for 71% of net sales. Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. Gross Margin For 2007, gross margin improved both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales when compared to 2006. Improvements were driven primarily by strong sales volumes in the Display Technologies, Telecommunications, and Environmental Technologies segments. Cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiencies in these segments also drove gross margin improvements in 2007 when compared to 2006. As a percentage of net sales, 2006 gross margin was up slightly from 2005 driven primarily by our Display Technologies segment. Gross margins for this segment were essentially even with 2005 reflecting the negative impact of price declines offset by higher volumes and cost reductions. Display Technologies segment sales increased from 38% of total Cornings sales in 2005 to 41% of Cornings sales in 2006. As Display Technologies has a higher gross margin than our consolidated gross margin, the added concentration in Display Technologies in 2006 caused Cornings gross margin percentage to increase from 43% in 2005 to 44% in 2006. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2007 when compared to 2006, in dollars, was largely due to an increase in compensation related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expense in 2007 declined slightly when compared to last year due to cost control efforts. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 compared to 2005, in dollars, was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), effective January 1, 2006. As a percent of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2006 and 2005 were comparable. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. Share Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for share based awards granted under the Companys stock compensation programs using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Under the intrinsic value method, no share based compensation cost related to stock options had been recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of operations, because the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date. As a result, the recognition of share based compensation cost was generally limited to the expense attributed to restricted stock awards, and stock option modifications. As permitted under SFAS 123, the Company reported pro forma disclosures presenting results and earnings per share as if we had used the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 in the notes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 24 Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method. Under the modified prospective application method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. In accordance with the modified prospective application method, results for prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in a decrease of $0.05 in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. See Note 17 (Share based Compensation) to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the impact of SFAS 123(R). Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses Research, development, and engineering expenditures for 2007 and 2006 increased by $48 million and $74 million, respectively, when compared to the previous year but remained even as a percentage of net sales. In 2007, approximately one third of total research, development, and engineering expenditures were for research spending related to our existing businesses, new business development, exploratory research, and early stage marketing. Expenditures for the past three years have been focused on our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments as we looked to capitalize on market opportunities in those segments. Expenses in each year also reflect costs associated with later stage development projects to support future growth. These projects include investments in new technologies such as synthetic green lasers, silicon on glass, and microreactors. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2006 and 2005 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A description of those charges follows: Impairment of Long Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill 2006 Impairment Charge for Assets Held for Use In 2006, we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of $44 million to impair certain long lived assets of our Telecommunications segment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Due to our lowered long term outlook for this business, we determined that an event of impairment, as defined by SFAS 144, had occurred in that business, which further required us to test this asset group for impairment. We assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. As a result of our impairment evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value. Other Credits 2005 Reversal of Currency Translation Adjustment In 2003, Corning sold its photonic business operations to Avanex. The photonics business was the sole operation of Corning O.T.I. S.r.l. (OTI), a wholly owned Italian subsidiary of Corning, whose results were included in Cornings Telecommunications segment. Subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of OTI to Avanex, Corning began liquidating OTI. In October 2005, the assets of OTI were determined to be substantially liquidated. As a result of the substantial liquidation, OTIs cumulative translation account was reversed, resulting in a gain of $84 million in the fourth quarter. Impairment of Available for Sale Securities 2005 Impairment Charge In 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $25 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in Avanex Corporation (Avanex) below its adjusted cost basis. Our investment in Avanex was accounted for as an available for sale security under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (SFAS 115). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our shares of Avanex. 25 Restructuring Actions 2005 Restructuring Actions Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $15 million in 2005 which included the following: A charge of $30 million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment. Net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling $15 million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of Corning Asahi Video Products and to our specialty materials business. Legal Settlement Asbestos On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement (the PCC Plan) with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC), which might arise from PCC products or operations. The proposed settlement, if the PCC Plan is approved and becomes effective, will require Corning to relinquish its equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. Corning also agreed to pay a total of $140 million in six annual installments (present value $131 million at March 2003), beginning one year after the PCC Plan becomes effective, with 5.5 percent interest from June 2004, and to assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of settlement. The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to consider objections to the PCC Plan were held in the Bankruptcy Court in May 2004. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court requested that the PCC Plan proponents delete references to Section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and resubmit the PCC Plan. The final round of oral argument was held on July 21, 2006. On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the PCC Plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, filed motions for reconsideration. These motions were argued on March 5, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Court reserved decision. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an Amended Plan of Reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the Bankruptcy Court to decide the motion for reconsideration. If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve the PCC Plan in its current form or parties to the proceeding agree to amend the PCC Plan, changes to the PCC Plan are reasonably likely to occur that could significantly reduce the value Corning would pay in such a changed plan. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain, and confirmation of the current PCC Plan or any amended PCC Plan is subject to a number of contingencies. However, apart from the quarterly mark to market adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement, management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. Two of Cornings primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation. Since March 28, 2003, we have recorded total net charges of $1.0 billion to reflect the initial settlement liability and subsequent adjustments for the change in the settlement value of the components of the liability. The following summarizes the charges and credits we have recorded for the proposed asbestos settlement (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Initial settlement charge $ 392 Fair market value adjustment for other components $ 53 $ 22 $ 21 $ 32 28 Mark to market common stock 132 (24 ) 197 33 115 Asbestos settlement $ 185 $ (2 ) $ 218 $ 65 $ 535 If the book value of the assets to be contributed in the asbestos settlement remains lower than the carrying value of the settlement liability, a gain would be recognized at the time of settlement. 26 The liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in PCE, assigned insurance proceeds, and the 25 million shares of our common stock, which totals $833 million at December 31, 2007, is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets. This portion of the PCC liability is considered a due on demand obligation. Accordingly, this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one year. The remaining portion of the settlement liability, which totals $169 million at December 31, 2007, representing the net present value of the cash payments, is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets. See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter. Other Income, Net For 2007 and 2006, other income, net increased by $78 million and $54 million, respectively, when compared to the previous year. The increase in both periods reflected an increase in royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate royalty income. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Before Income Taxes In addition to the items identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) and Asbestos Settlement, the items below had an impact on Income Before Income Taxes as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Loss on repurchases and retirement of debt, net $ 15 $ 11 $ 16 Movements in exchange rates (19 ) (41 ) (34 ) Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Provision for income taxes $ 80 $ 55 $ 578 Effective income tax rate 6.2% 5.7% 103.4% The effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets; and The benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for 2005 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The impact of our inability to record tax benefits on net operating losses generated in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions; The increase of our U.S. valuation allowance of $525 million; and The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), provides that deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. SFAS No. 109 further requires that in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, objective evidence (e.g. actual, historical information) should be given greater weight than subjective evidence (e.g. the outlook for future profitability). In 2005 and 2004 we recorded valuation allowances against our entire U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the U.S. in recent years. In doing so, we recorded valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets that existed at December 31, 2003, as well as against additional U.S. deferred tax assets generated in 2005 and 2004 due to losses in those years. In both 2007 and 2006, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of valuation allowances and, thus, not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S. is a reduction in our effective tax rate of 14.2% for both 2007 and 2006. 27 We continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our entire U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007 because we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate in the future sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets. U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion dollars would be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007. Of that amount, $4.2 billion of U.S. profits would be required over the next 19 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards. Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is inherently subjective and is based on our analysis and weighting of all positive and negative evidence available to us. This evaluation includes estimates and assumptions about a number of market, execution and economic variables. Our judgment as of December 31, 2007 has been formed based on these variables which include: We had a taxable loss in the U.S. in 2005 and, absent nonrecurring items, we would have also had a taxable loss in the U.S. in 2006. 2007 is the only year in the last three years in which we have generated income in the U.S. when considering only recurring items. Although our consolidated net income has reached record levels, we have continued to incur losses or have generated only marginal profitability in the U.S. because (a) Display Technologies, the key driver of our consolidated profitability, is largely a foreign based business with only net royalty income occurring in the U.S.; (b) our Environmental and Life Sciences segments have lost money or have been only marginally profitable due to very significant U.S. based factory start up costs and developmental spending; and (c) improvement in our Telecommunications segment has been more than offset by higher U.S. based research, development, and engineering, stock and incentive compensation and other administrative expenses. A significant factor in our forecasts of future U.S. taxable profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our Display Technologies businesses to the U.S. The amount of such royalties could decline if our sales of LCD glass are impacted by: manufacturing capacity constraints; (a) reduced demand due to the slowing of corporate information technology and consumer spending or (b) challenges to pricing, both of which may arise from global economic pressures; or shifts in the global market share of our customers which manufacture flat panel TV and computer monitors. Additionally, a change in our judgment regarding the sustainability of the level of these royalties in accordance with the principles of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) may also impact our forecasts of U.S. profitability. Although we remain optimistic about our consolidated outlook for 2008 and beyond, as of December 31, 2007, we are sufficiently uncertain about our U.S. based results primarily due to the current economic uncertainty but also due to a number of market and execution risks in our operating segments, particularly those pertaining to Display Technologies, as noted above that we have concluded that the positive evidence supporting realization of our U.S deferred tax assets does not sufficiently outweigh the negative evidence that we may not realize our U.S. deferred tax assets. We will update our assessment of the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis in 2008, taking into account year to date actual as well as forecasted U.S. results. If, after considering the actual results and the potential impact of the economic uncertainties and business risks considered in our 2007 year end assessment as well as our FIN 48 assessment of the Display Technologies U.S. royalties, we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be profitable in the U.S. in 2008 and future years, we will quantify the portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets we believe to be realizable and reduce our valuation allowance accordingly. Until that time, we will continue to adjust the valuation allowance to offset the current U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) that would otherwise be recorded on income (or losses) in the U.S. and, therefore, reflect no net U.S. income tax expense. In 2004, we recorded valuation allowances against our entire German and Australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years. In 2007, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the German national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance is no longer required. In 2006, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in Australia and at certain of our German operations, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the German local and the entire Australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required. The impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.4% and 8.7% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China, South Africa and Taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years (2006 to 2011) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.1%, 10.1%, and 8.9%, for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays, the effective income tax rate for 2005 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to increasing the valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets. 28 In 2004, significant events occurred which required us to increase the valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets. At that time, we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $525 million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in Dow Corning, a non strategic appreciated asset, if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards. During 2005, Dow Cornings performance was much stronger than expected and Dow Corning resumed paying a dividend; both of which are expected to continue in the future. Due to this improved performance, we concluded that Dow Corning provides strong financial, geographic and market balance to Cornings portfolio of businesses, the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment. As a result, we considered Dow Corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of Dow Corning would be prudent, as required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Therefore, we no longer believed, in the fourth quarter of 2005, that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we increased our valuation allowance by $525 million to fully reserve our net U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005, which increased our effective tax rate by 94%. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters. Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Samsung Corning Precision $ 582 $ 555 $ 408 Dow Corning 345 334 253 Samsung Corning (50 ) (112 ) All other 65 71 62 Total equity earnings $ 942 $ 960 $ 611 The 2007 and 2006 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Corning Precision and at Dow Corning when compared to the previous years. Additional information about the change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained in the discussion of the performance of the Display Technologies segment. Dow Corning performance was driven by sales growth in their traditional silicone product lines and in polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries. Dow Corning sales grew approximately 12% in 2007. Approximately 80% of Dow Cornings sales were in their traditional silicone product lines. The remaining sales were from polysilicone products. Net income at Dow Corning, and Cornings resulting equity earnings from Dow Corning, increased 3% in 2007 when compared to 2006, reflecting the growth in net sales offset in part by the non repeat of a $33 million favorable IRS settlement in 2006 described below. Sales at Dow Corning are expected to grow between 10% and 12% in 2008 when compared to 2007, driven by increasing worldwide demand for silicone products and polysilicone products. Growth in net income, and thus in Cornings equity in earnings from Dow Corning, is expected to be greater than 12%. In addition to the above, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits: In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning were reduced by $40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges. In 2006, Dow Corning reached a settlement with the IRS regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003. Equity earnings reflected a $33 million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all Federal tax issues related to Dow Cornings implant settlement. In 2006, Samsung Corning recorded the following items which increased Cornings equity earnings by $2 million, net: a gain on the sale of land which increased Cornings equity earnings by $61 million; an impairment charge on certain long lived assets which reduced Cornings equity earnings by $46 million; and the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets which reduced Cornings equity earnings by $13 million. In 2005, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube (CRT) glass business. The charge, which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs, reduced Cornings equity earnings by $106 million in the third quarter. In 2005, Dow Corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock. Cornings equity earnings included $11 million related to this gain. 29 Until December 31, 2007, Corning had a 50% interest in Samsung Corning. Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and affiliates owned the remaining 50% interest in Samsung Corning. On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. Net Income As a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income $ 2,150 $ 1,855 $ 585 Basic earnings per common share $ 1.37 $ 1.20 $ 0.40 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.34 $ 1.16 $ 0.38 Shares used in computing basic per share amounts 1,566 1,550 1,464 Shares used in computing diluted per share amounts 1,603 1,594 1,535 OPERATING SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments include Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. The Environmental Technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments, as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. The following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment: Display Technologies manufactures glass substrates for use in liquid crystal flat panel displays; Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry; Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications; and Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for pharmaceutical and scientific applications. All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as All Other. We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Display Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Display Technologies segment (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 % Change 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Net sales $ 2,613 $ 2,133 $ 1,742 23 22 Income before equity earnings $ 1,404 $ 1,052 $ 823 33 28 Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 582 $ 565 $ 416 3 36 Net income $ 1,986 $ 1,617 $ 1,239 23 31 2007 vs. 2006 The net sales increase for 2007 reflected volume gains of 38% (measured in square feet of glass sold) offset somewhat by price declines of 11% when compared to 2006. Volume gains were driven by increased LCD monitor demand, continued demand for glass for notebook computers, and LCD TV market growth. LCD TV market growth has resulted from both an increase in market penetration and an increase in the demand for larger size LCD glass substrates (generation 5 and above). Large size glass substrates, which carry a slightly higher selling price per square foot, continued to account for a significant portion of total sales volumes and were approximately 85% and 82% of sales volumes for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net sales of the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements on this segments net sales was not material in 2007 when compared with last year. 30 When compared to 2006, income before equity earnings for 2007 was up significantly due to higher net sales, lower manufacturing costs, and an increase in royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate royalty income. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions. Equity earnings for 2007 increased by 5% when compared to 2006 due to volume gains of 39% at Samsung Corning Precision offset by price declines of 15% and increased operating and royalty expenses. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements on equity earnings was not material in 2007 when compared with 2006. The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. For 2007, AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, and Sharp Corporation, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 62% of total segment sales when combined. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2007, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and LG Phillips LCD Co., Ltd. accounted for approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales. Corning continues to invest heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2007 and 2006, capital spending in this segment was $883 million and $829 million, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2008 to be in the range of $800 million to $1.0 billion. In December 2007, we announced a 5 year capital expenditure plan of $795 million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporations plant in Sakai City, Japan. Production from this new facility is expected to meet Sharp Corporations plan to begin production of LCD panels for large televisions by March 2010. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. The range provided for 2008 segment capital spending includes some spending for recently announced projects. 2006 vs. 2005 The net sales increase for 2006 reflected overall LCD glass market growth. During 2006, glass substrate volumes increased 52% compared with 2005, driven by the same factors described in 2007. Sales of large size glass substrates accounted for 69% of total sales volumes in 2005. The growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 16%. Movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted 2006 sales by approximately $122 million (or 7%) when compared with 2005. In the second quarter of 2006, the Display Technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of 2001. The lower volume was the result of a number of our customers, primarily in Taiwan, idling part of their facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass, as a result of a build up of panel inventory in the supply chain. Both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of 2006 when our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up LCD panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand. For 2006, the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes and manufacturing cost reductions, offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates. Movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 income before equity earnings by approximately 5% when compared with 2005. The increase in our 2006 equity earnings, primarily from Samsung Corning Precision, was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned business. In 2006, Samsung Corning Precisions earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 8% from movements in exchange rates compared to 2005. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollarJapanese yen and U.S. dollarKorean won exchange rates. In 2005 and 2004, Corning and several customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which the Display Technologies segment agreed to supply large size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. In 2007 and 2006, Corning received $105 million and $171 million, respectively, of customer deposits and issued $231 million and $126 million, respectively in credit memoranda. We do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. Refer to Note 10 (Other Liabilities) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In the event customers elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits. 31 Outlook: We expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for LCD televisions. Absent the impact of an economic slowdown, we anticipate the volume growth in the LCD glass market to be between 25% and 30% in 2008. The expected market volume growth, measured in square feet, for the year should be equal to the volume growth in the market in 2007. Cornings LCD glass volume is expected to grow at the lower end of this range, while Samsung Corning Precisions volume growth should be higher than the range. Growth rates by region for the industry generally, and thus for Cornings wholly owned business and Samsung Corning Precision, may be different based on market dynamics. We expect sales volume in the first quarter of 2008 to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007, as LCD glass is in short supply. We expect price declines in the first quarter of 2008 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2007. Although end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks currently remains strong, we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions, particularly the slowing U.S. economy, and political tensions could have on consumer demand. There is no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years, that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand, or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period. While the industry has grown rapidly, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes; prices; or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. Telecommunications The following table provides net sales and other data for the Telecommunications segment (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 % Change 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 880 $ 877 $ 834 5 Hardware and equipment 899 852 789 6 8 Total net sales $ 1,779 $ 1,729 $ 1,623 3 7 Net income (loss) $ 108 $ 7 $ 68 1,443 (90 ) 2007 vs. 2006 Segment net sales continue to be favorably impacted by growth in the Telecommunications industry and in the private network market. Approximately 75% of segment net sales were sold into the public network market. Growth in the public network market was driven by favorable public policy, especially in the U.S., which fosters facilities based competition and by strong financial health of service providers worldwide. Financially sound service providers have the ability to maintain or increase capital spending on network investments. During the year, there was a broadening of worldwide access construction projects such as fiber to the premises and fiber to the node. Approximately 54% of the worlds largest access service providers had some activity related to access construction, which was up from 46% in 2006. The remaining 25% of this segments net sales were sold into the private network market. Demand in the private network market was driven, in particular, by growth in data centers. Growth in the public and private markets had a favorable impact on both optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment product sales. In 2007, Corning introduced the ClearCurve ultra bendable optical fiber based suite of products that enable fiber deployments to multi dwelling units. We expect to begin shipments of ClearCurve products in early 2008. Effective April 30, 2007, Corning sold its European submarine cabling business and recorded a gain of $19 million on the sale. Effective April 1, 2006, Advance Cable Systems (ACS), currently an equity company affiliate, assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in Japan. As a result of these two transactions, sales for 2007 are not comparable to sales for the same period last year. 32 Telecommunications segment net sales, excluding the impact of sales of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in Japan, increased 10 percent in 2007. This is a non GAAP financial measure which management believes is useful to investors to understand the 2007 year over year growth of this segments net sales. The following is a reconciliation of this non GAAP measure to the related GAAP measure: 2007 2006 % Change Telecommunications segment net sales (GAAP) $ 1,779 $ 1,729 3% Sales of submarine cabling products 39 118 Sales of optical cable in Japan 23 Telecommunications segment net sales excluding the above two items(non GAAP) $ 1,740 $ 1,588 10% In 2007, optical fiber market volume exceeded the previous market peak which occurred in 2001, confirming a recovery from the 2002 global telecommunications market downturn. Volume increases in 2007 were offset somewhat by price declines when compared to the previous year. In addition, 2007 net sales were positively impacted by $37 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, when compared to 2006. Net income in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due to improvements in segment sales, cost reductions, the impact of the $19 million gain on the sale of the European submarine cabling business, and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled $44 million in 2006. A favorable mix for optical fiber and cable products also contributed to improvements in segment net income. In 2007, net income of this segment was positively impacted by $3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared with 2006. The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2007, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales, accounted for 25% of total segment sales when combined. 2006 vs. 2005 Increases in 2006 segment net sales were driven by improved sales in North America, Europe and China. The increase was driven by a broader recovery in the Telecommunications industry and growth in the private network market. Volume increases were offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to 2005. Movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segments net sales, primarily the Euro and Japanese yen, did not have a significant impact on sales in 2006 when compared to the previous year. As noted above, sales of this segment in 2006 were negatively impacted when ACS assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in Japan. Sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in Japan, which are now recorded by an equity affiliate, were $23 million in 2006 and $75 million in 2005. For the Telecommunications segment, net income in 2006 and 2005 was impacted by restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits. In 2006, we recorded an after tax impairment charge of $44 million. In 2005, we recorded net after tax credits of $47 million. Refer to Results of Operations for a discussion of these items. The decline in net income for this segment in 2006, when compared to 2005, was primarily the result of the 2006 impairment charge described above and the absence of net after tax credits of $47 million that were recorded in 2005. In 2006, movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact the results for this operating segment. Outlook: For the Telecommunications segment, we expect sales and earnings to increase in 2008, reflecting continued strength in public and private network demand when compared to the last two years. Growth in the public network market is expected to benefit from increasing access construction activity. Private network growth is expected to result from data centers, internet protocol networks, and increased network speed which favors optical fiber products over copper. We expect sales in the first quarter of 2008 to increase by approximately 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer. We expect manufacturing efficiencies will offset price declines. Changes in our customers expected deployment plan, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect the sales level. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. 33 Environmental Technologies The following table provides net sales and other data for the Environmental Technologies segment (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 % Change 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Net sales: Automotive $ 508 $ 451 $ 482 13 (6 ) Diesel 249 164 98 52 67 Total net sales $ 757 $ 615 $ 580 23 6 Net income (loss) $ 60 $ 7 $ 15 757 (53 ) 2007 vs. 2006 Sales of the Environmental Technologies segment in 2007 were higher when compared to 2006 due to increased sales from the diesel product lines and strong demand for automotive substrates. Diesel sales in 2007 reflected increased sales of heavy duty diesel products to meet the U.S. emission regulations which went into effect on January 2, 2007. Sales of automotive products also improved when compared to last year due to an increase in sales to European and Asian customers. Net sales of this segment were positively impacted by $23 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. Net income of this segment was up when compared to last year due to higher sales, manufacturing efficiencies, and the impact of favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by modest price declines. Improved utilization of our diesel manufacturing capacity also contributed to increased net income in this segment. Net income was positively impacted by $5 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. In 2007, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 81% of total segment sales. 2006 vs. 2005 Sales of this segment in 2006 were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in Diesel products sales, primarily for light duty diesel vehicle applications. However, this increase was offset by a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes. As end customers shift demand toward smaller, more energy efficient vehicles, demand for larger automobiles has declined. This shift in demand has caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles. In addition, volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller substrates. Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment. The decrease in net income in 2006 versus 2005 was due primarily to increased research, development, and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products. Outlook: We expect both sales and earnings improvements in the Environmental Technologies segment in 2008. Automotive substrate sales are expected to remain even with 2007 levels. Diesel products sales are expected to increase more than 25% in 2008 as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards continue to drive sales improvements. Heavy duty diesel sales have been impacted by the weak freight market in the U.S. The pace of recovery in that market will influence the rate of growth in sales of diesel products. Segment profitability is expected to increase due to higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions. We expect sales in the first quarter to increase by approximately 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Changes in automotive and diesel vehicle production could adversely impact sales and net income of this segment. 34 Life Sciences The following table provides net sales and other data for the Life Sciences segment (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 % Change 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Net sales $ 307 $ 287 $ 282 7 2 Net loss $ (4 ) $ (17 ) $ (4 ) (76 ) 325 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales of the Life Sciences segment were up when compared to last year driven by market growth and higher prices. Government and private spending for drug development, discovery, and production, continue to drive market growth in this segment. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales for the periods presented. Improved profitability of this segment in 2007 resulted from higher sales, movements in foreign exchange rates, manufacturing efficiencies, and the absence of restructuring charges. Segment profitability in all years was impacted by development spending for new products. Movements in foreign exchange rates had a $4 million favorable impact on results of this segment for 2007 when compared with 2006. In the Life Sciences segment, one customer accounted for approximately 44% of this segments net sales in 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 Net sales of the Life Sciences segment were up slightly in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the U.S. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales. The segment operated at a loss due to significant research, development, and engineering spending related to the Epic&reg; System, a high throughput label free screening platform based on optical biosensor technology, which had its market launch in 2006. The segment loss also includes $5 million of severance, curtailment, and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the United Kingdom. Outlook: Sales for 2008 are expected to increase over 2007 driven by market growth, price increases, and sales of Epic&reg; System products. We expect sales in the first quarter of 2008 to be up slightly versus the fourth quarter of 2007. All Other The following table provides net sales and other data (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 2005 % Change 07 vs. 06 06 vs. 05 Other businesses net sales $ 404 $ 410 $ 352 (1 ) 16 Net income (loss) $ (20 ) $ 47 $ (66 ) (143 ) (171 ) All Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting. Sales in this segment for 2007 were lower than 2006 due to a decline in sales of the Specialty Materials business. Sales in 2006 reflected stronger sales of the Specialty Materials business when compared to 2005. Net income for each period presented reflected the impact of impairment and other charges and credits recorded by Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, Cornings share of these items was a charge of $40 million, a credit of $2 million, and a charge of $106 million, respectively. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 35 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing and Capital Structure The following items were significant to Cornings financing and capital structure during 2007: In the first quarter, we repurchased $223 million of our 6.25% Euro notes due in 2010. We recognized a $15 million loss upon the early redemption of these notes. In the second quarter, all three of our rating agencies upgraded our debt ratings to BBB+ or the equivalent. Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion which was considerably greater than our $1.3 billion of capital spending. In the third quarter of 2007, we began paying a quarterly dividend of $0.05 on the Companys common stock. Dividend payments of $79 million were made in both the third and fourth quarter of 2007. On July 18, 2007, Cornings Board of Directors approved the repurchase of $500 million of common stock between the date of the announcement and December 31, 2008. We repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for $250 million as part of this repurchase program. Refer to Note 11 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements for further information. In November 2006, we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through March 2011. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2008 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, with approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion used to expand manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment. Additionally, approximately $200 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products and approximately $70 million will be spent on the expansion of the Companys Sullivan Park Research and Development campus. Short Term Investments Included in our $1.3 billion short term investments at December 31, 2007, were $301 million of asset backed securities. Asset backed securities are collateralized by credit card loans, auto loans, mortgages, and student loans. At December 31, 2007, our exposure to sub prime mortgages was $17 million. Unrealized losses on securities backed by sub prime mortgages, which are rated as investment grade, were approximately $1 million at December 31, 2007, and are expected to recover in the short term. Realized losses on these items amounted to $6 million in 2007. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy has been to contribute, as necessary, an amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the companys long term funding targets. In 2007, we made voluntary cash contributions of $131 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $18 million to our international pension plans. In 2006, we made an incremental cash contribution of $15 million to our domestic and international pension plans. Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. Customer deposits have been received in the following periods (in millions): 2006 2007 Total Customer deposits received $ 171 $ 105 $ 276 We do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. 36 In 2007 and 2006, we issued $231 million and $126 million, respectively, in credit memoranda. These credit amounts are not included in the above amounts and were applied against customer receivables. Customer deposit liabilities were $531 million and $633 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, we expect to issue approximately $190 million in credit memoranda. Restructuring During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we made payments of $39 million, $15 million, and $25 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Cash payments for employee related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2008, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010. Key Balance Sheet Data At December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $3.5 billion, compared with $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase from December 31, 2006, was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows. Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): As of December 31, 2007 2006 Working capital $ 2,782 $ 2,479 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ (734 ) $ (688 ) Current ratio 2.1:1 2.1:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 856 $ 746 Days sales outstanding 50 48 Inventories $ 631 $ 639 Inventory turns 4.7 4.6 Days payable outstanding (1) 64 81 Long term debt $ 1,514 $ 1,696 Total debt to total capital 14% 19% (1) Includes trade payables only. Credit Ratings As of February 15, 2008, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Long Term Debt Outlook Last Update Fitch BBB+ Stable June 29, 2007 Standard & Poors BBB+ Stable July 2, 2007 Moodys Baa1 Stable June 19, 2007 Management Assessment of Liquidity Our major source of funding for 2008 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. From time to time, we may issue debt securities to refinance debt securities maturing in the next few years. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and our stock repurchase program. 37 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: Guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. FIN 45 requires a company, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. Refer to Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under FASB Interpretation 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (FIN 46R). The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by FIN 46R. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. Corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities, and as required by FIN 46R the financial statements of the entity are included in Cornings consolidated financial statements. Corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such, FIN 46R does not require Corning to include them in its consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity. In 2005 and prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), Corning had employee compensation awards (stock options) that were excluded from the balance sheet. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 provides an exception to this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entitys own stock and classified in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), employee stock option awards were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph 11(a) criteria. In 2007 and 2006, those options were recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. In 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006, we had other non employee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph 11(a). Those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods. 38 Contractual Obligations The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions): Total Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Less than1 year 1 to 2years 2 to 3years 3 to 4years 5 years andthereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 77 $ 9 $ 2 $ 66 Credit facilities for equity companies 168 18 150 Stand by letters of credit (1) 68 44 24 Loan guarantees 12 12 Subtotal of commitment expirations per period $ 325 $ 53 $ 44 $ 228 Purchase obligations 262 102 75 $ 37 $ 5 43 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 244 244 Total debt (3) 1,437 20 72 78 18 1,249 Minimum rental commitments 243 47 40 33 29 94 Capital leases (4) 97 5 6 5 34 47 Interest on long term debt (5) 1,243 92 89 87 84 891 Uncertain tax positions (6) 20 11 9 Subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period 3,546 521 291 240 170 2,324 Total commitments and contingencies $ 3,871 $ 574 $ 335 $ 240 $ 170 $ 2,552 (1) At December 31, 2007, $38 million of the $68 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet. (3) At December 31, 2007, $1,537 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value. (4) At December 31, 2007, $19 million of the $97 million represents imputed interest. (5) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity/expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. (6) At December 31, 2007, $25 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $5 million of that amount will become payable. We have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning discussed in Note 7 (Investments) and Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. Pensions We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2007, this plan accounted for 80% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 90% of the related plans assets. At December 31, 2006, Corning adopted SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of $669 million after tax. Dow Cornings adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in Dow Corning and a decrease to stockholders equity of $94 million after tax. Refer to Note 12 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2009. For 2007, we made voluntary cash contributions of $149 million to our domestic and international pension plans. For 2006, we made an incremental contribution of $15 million to our domestic and international pension plans. We anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately $50 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2008. 39 ENVIRONMENT We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had accrued approximately $19 million (undiscounted) and $16 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In certain circumstances, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. If we sustain an appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S., or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies, adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements. 40 Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS 5) requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case specific issues. See Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the PCC asbestos liability. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives. We have reached a tentative plan of settlement on PCC as disclosed in Legal Proceedings and Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals. On December 21, 2006, the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the PCC Plan of Reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from PCCs products or operations. Several parties, including Corning, have moved for reconsideration of the ruling. We continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling, or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claims deriving from PCC. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. Other possible liabilities SFAS 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2007, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,246 million. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Change in Assumption Effect on 2008Pre Tax Pension Expense Effective onDecember 31, 2007 PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5.4 million +$61 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5.4 million $59 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$5.5 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $5.5 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2007, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $79 million before tax, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $81 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. 41 The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Change in Assumption Effect on 2008Pre Tax OPEB Expense Effective onDecember 31, 2007 APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$1 million +$20 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $1 million $20 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue Recognition In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. Stock Compensation Stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk free discount rates, expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and currently available market place data. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings future stock based compensation expense and disclosures. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financials statements. 42 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, forecasts, and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions; tariffs, import duties and currency fluctuations; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or major health concerns; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand, which may fluctuate; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; stock price fluctuations; customer acceptance of LCD televisions; a downturn in demand or decline in growth rates for LCD glass substrates; customer ability, most notably in the Display Technologies segment, to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their manufacturing expansions; fluctuations in supply chain inventory levels; equity company activities, principally at Dow Corning Corporation, and Samsung Corning Precision; movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, Euro, and Korean won; and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. 43 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates have the following effects: exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. Our most significant foreign currency exposure is the Japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the Korean won, the Taiwan dollar, and the Euro. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in the other income, net component in the consolidated statement of operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments was $942 million in 2007 and $960 million in 2006 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 63% of this amount in 2007. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $532 million for 2007 and $555 million for 2006. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2007, we had open forward contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2007. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $239 million. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $146 million. As we derive approximately 70% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our outlooks included in Managements Discussion and Analysis assume exchange rates during 2008 remain constant at January 2008 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2008 net sales of approximately $239 million and net income of approximately $220 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2008 net sales of approximately $61 million and net income of approximately $12 million. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2007, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 34% of variable rate instruments.
