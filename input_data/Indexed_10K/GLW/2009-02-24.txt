Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. This discussion includes the following sections: Overview Results of Operations Operating Segments Liquidity and Capital Resources Environment Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Forward Looking Statements OVERVIEW Corning delivered improved operating results for the full year of 2008 although results for the first and second half of the year were dramatically different. In the first half of 2008, our performance reflected strength in the majority of our segments while the downturn in global economic activity and disruption in the financial markets negatively impacted our performance in the second half. Declines in consumer retail markets caused a significant decrease in demand for products of our Display and Environmental Technologies segments. During 2008, the Company responded to the economic conditions that have affected demand for our products by scaling back manufacturing operations, curbing the rate of growth in research, development and engineering expenses, reducing capital spending, and reducing operating costs. In January Corning announced restructuring charges in the range of $115 million to $165 million primarily for costs associated with workforce reductions that will take place in 2009. Cornings strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial independence has served us well. Our key priorities for 2008 were unchanged from the previous three years: protect our financial health, improve our profitability, and invest in the future. We made significant progress on these priorities in 2008. Financial Health Despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment, our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities. Significant items in 2008 included the following: Our debt to capital ratio of 11% reflected an improvement from 14% at December 31, 2007, resulting primarily from solid earnings and the impact of certain tax related items. Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion which was more than our $1.9 billion of capital spending. We ended the year with $2.8 billion of cash and short term investments. Profitability For the year ended December 31, 2008, we generated net income of $5.3 billion or $3.32 per share compared to net income of $2.2 billion or $1.34 per share for 2007. When compared to last year, the $3.1 billion improvement in net income was due largely to the following items: Certain tax adjustments totaling $2.5 billion which included the release of $2.4 billion of valuation allowances resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets in future years and the release of $115 million of valuation allowances resulting from a change in estimate regarding current year U.S. taxable income A credit to asbestos litigation expense of $340 million in 2008 reflecting the change in the estimate of our asbestos litigation liability compared to expense of $185 million last year. In the first quarter of 2008, Corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by $327 million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in 2003. For additional information on this matter, refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Higher net income in the Display Technologies segment driven by a stronger Japanese yen and improvements in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision, our equity affiliate located in Korea. 21 Table of Contents Investing in our future We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems. We remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. In 2008, approximately one third of our total research, development and engineering expenditures was for research and new business development. This spending related to our existing businesses, new business development, exploratory research, and early stage marketing. We continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises. We continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the Epic system, synthetic green lasers, silicon on glass, microreactors, thin film photovoltaics, and mercury abatement. Our research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $62 million in 2008 when compared to 2007 but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales. The largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. Our capital expenditures have been primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the Display Technologies segment in anticipation of a larger display market in 2010 and growing demand for Cornings Gorilla glass, an optical quality glass that is optimized for high end portable devices and touch screens. In December 2007, we announced a 5 year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporations plant in Sakai City, Japan. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. Given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and resulting decline in demand for our products, we have stopped further expansion in Taiwan. We have, however, continued to advance our project in Sakai City to align with Sharp Corporations progress on their adjoining facility. Higher precious metals prices also impacted the growth in capital spending. Total capital expenditures for 2008 were $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $155 million was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment. We expect our 2009 capital spending to be about $1.1 billion. Approximately $700 million will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment, of which about $525 million relates to construction completed in 2008. Corporate Outlook For 2009, we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be negatively impacted by the global economic recession. The restructuring plan we announced in January 2009 sizes the company to be profitable at a $5 billion sales level. Although the current run rate of our sales is about $4 billion, we believe that $5 billion of sales is possible assuming the supply chain contraction in our Display Technologies segment ends by the second quarter of 2009. If we do not see an increase in our sales by the second quarter, we will take additional restructuring actions. During these difficult economic times, the Company is focused on three priorities: preserving cash, restructuring the company to be profitable at a lower sales level, and accelerating new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth. Although there is much uncertainty as we head into 2009, we are confident about our financial health and the strength of our balance sheet. We remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued long term success. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 % Change 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales $ 5,948 $ 5,860 $ 5,174 2 13 Gross margin $ 2,738 $ 2,749 $ 2,283 0 20 (gross margin %) 46 % 47 % 44 % Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 901 $ 912 $ 857 (1 ) 6 (as a % of revenues) 15 % 16 % 17 % Research, development and engineering expenses $ 627 $ 565 $ 517 11 9 (as a % of revenues) 11 % 10 % 10 % Restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) $ 19 $ (4 ) $ 54 (575 ) (107 ) (as a % of revenues) 0 % 0 % 1 % Asbestos litigation (credit) charge $ (340 ) $ 185 $ (2 ) (284 ) (9,350 ) (as a % of revenues) (6 )% 3 % 0 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,523 $ 1,291 $ 961 18 34 (as a % of revenues) 26 % 22 % 19 % Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 2,405 $ (80 ) $ (55 ) (3,106 ) 45 (as a % of revenues) 40 % (1 )% (1 )% Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments $ 1,328 $ 942 $ 960 41 (2 ) (as a % of revenues) 22 % 16 % 19 % Net income $ 5,257 $ 2,150 $ 1,855 145 16 (as a % of revenues) 88 % 37 % 36 % Net Sales Net sales in 2008 were up slightly when compared to 2007 primarily due to the positive impact of $354 million from the movement in foreign exchange rates offset by volume and price declines in a number of our segments. Our sales results followed the changing global economic conditions during the year. Net sales for the first half of 2008 were up 21% when compared with the first half of 2007 but down 16% for the second half of 2008 when compared to the second half of 2007 as the LCD glass market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened with deteriorating economic conditions. Declines in consumer spending reduced demand for LCD televisions and monitors and automotive products in the second half of 2008. The net sales increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily the result of increased volume in the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, and Telecommunications segments. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2007 net sales when compared with 2006. In 2008, net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the U.S. market. For 2008, sales into international markets accounted for 74% of net sales. For 2007 and 2006, sales into international markets accounted for 72% and 71%, respectively, of net sales. Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. 23 Table of Contents Gross Margin For 2008, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales was relatively even when compared with 2007. Although gross margin was comparable on a full year basis, in 2008 our gross margin percent remained above 47% in each of the first three quarters and then fell to 28% in the fourth quarter. The decline in gross margin in the fourth quarter resulted from significantly lower volume in our Display Technologies, Telecommunications, and Environmental Technologies segments, the impact of excess idle capacity costs, and accelerated depreciation as we idled the manufacturing capacity in our Display Technologies segment by more than 50%. For 2007, gross margin improved both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales when compared with 2006. Improvements were driven by strong sales in the Display Technologies, Telecommunications, and Environmental Technologies segments along with cost reduction efforts, and manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses The slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 when compared to 2007, in dollars, resulted from a decrease in performance based compensation costs caused by the impact of the decline in profitability in most of our operating segments in the second half of 2008. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2007 when compared to 2006, in dollars, was largely due to an increase in compensation related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2007 declined slightly when compared to 2006 due to cost control efforts. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2008 and in 2006 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A description of those charges follows: 2008 Restructuring Actions In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded $22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment. 2006 Impairment Charge for Assets Held for Use In 2006, we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of $44 million to impair certain long lived assets of our Telecommunications segment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Due to our lowered long term outlook for this business, we determined that an event of impairment, as defined by SFAS 144, had occurred in that business, which further required us to test this asset group for impairment. We assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. As a result of our impairment evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value. Asbestos Litigation In the first quarter of 2008, Corning recorded a credit to asbestos litigation expense of $327 million as a result of the increase in likelihood of a settlement under the Amended PCC Plan and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under the 2003 Plan. For the remainder of 2008, Corning recorded net credit adjustments of $13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated liability under an Amended PCC Plan. The liability for the Amended PCC Plan and the non PCC asbestos claims was estimated to be $662 million at December 31, 2008, compared with an estimate of liability under the original 2003 Plan of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2007. The entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the Amended PCC Plan is ultimately confirmed and the PCE portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of Cornings investment in PCE (currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment). Since March 28, 2003, we have recorded total net charges of $662 million to reflect the initial asbestos liability and subsequent adjustments for the change in the value of the components of the liability. See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter. 24 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income, net in Cornings consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision $ 184 $ 141 $ 82 Foreign currency exchange and hedge (losses) / gains (112 ) 29 28 Net realized losses of available for sale securities (53 ) (6 ) (2 ) Loss on sale of Steuben glass business (14 ) Gain on sale of Cornings submarine cabling business 19 Loss on repurchase of debt, net (15 ) (11 ) Other, net (28 ) (21 ) (24 ) Total $ (23 ) $ 147 $ 73 Income Before Income Taxes In addition to the items identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits), Asbestos Litigation (Credit) Charges, and Other (Expense) Income, Net, movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented. In 2008, Income Before Income Taxes included $35 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. In 2007 and 2006, Income Before Income Taxes was negatively impacted by $19 million and $41 million, respectively by movements in foreign exchange rates. Provision for Income Taxes Our (benefit) provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ (2,405 ) $ 80 $ 55 Effective income tax (benefit) rate (158.0 )% 6.2 % 5.7 % The effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2008 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The release of $2.5 billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets in future years, described below; The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions; and A $40 million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the Canadian Revenue Agency. The effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets; and The benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions. Prior to 2006, we recorded valuation allowances against our entire U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the U.S. In both 2007 and 2006, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. In 2008, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the U.S. As a result, we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance was needed. The evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective. Following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008: 25 Table of Contents Positive pre tax income in the U.S. for the first half of 2008 and the preceding year. The impact of positive results in the Display Technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this segment. A significant factor in our forecasts of future U.S. tax profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our Display Technologies subsidiaries to the U.S. parent company. The number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. Corning has approximately 16 years remaining to utilize the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards. Increased confidence in our longer term forecasted income levels which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses. Our five year planning process which is completed annually in the second quarter, considered a number of possible scenarios which support the future realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets. In accordance with SFAS 109, in the second half of 2008 we utilized a portion of the remaining valuation allowance to offset U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) that would otherwise have been recorded on income (or losses) in the U.S. in 2008 and therefore, reflected no net U.S. income tax expense. In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we released an additional $70 million and $45 million, respectively, of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of current year U.S. taxable income. In 2009, we will begin providing U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) on earnings (losses). In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of the valuation allowances, and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S., was a reduction in our effective tax rate of 16.2% for 2008 and 14.2% for both 2007 and 2006. Certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other federal and state tax credits, will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of December 31, 2008, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire. The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that have valuation allowances at December 31, 2008 was $230 million. We do not provide income taxes on the post 1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax free without significant cost. Income taxes have been provided for post 1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover tax free. Unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested. We currently provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2008, U.S. taxes have not been provided on approximately $6.6 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings which are expected to remain invested indefinitely. In 2004, we recorded valuation allowances against our entire German and Australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years. In 2007, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the German national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required. In 2006, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in Australia and at certain of our German operations, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the German local and the entire Australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required. The impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.4% and 8.7% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China and Taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years (2006 to 2012) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 10.1%, 12.1%, and 10.1%, for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters. 26 Table of Contents Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Samsung Corning Precision $ 911 $ 582 $ 555 Dow Corning 369 345 334 Samsung Corning (50 ) All other 48 65 71 Total equity earnings $ 1,328 $ 942 $ 960 The 2008 and 2007 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, reflected strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Corning Precision and at Dow Corning when compared to the previous years. The change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained in the discussion of the performance of the Display Technologies segment and in All Other. Dow Cornings 2008 performance was driven by sales growth in its traditional silicone product lines and in polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries. Dow Corning sales grew 10% in 2008 with the largest growth at Hemlock Semiconductor, Dow Cornings consolidated joint venture that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar energy industries. Sales of Dow Cornings traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to last year. Net income at Dow Corning, and Cornings resulting equity earnings from Dow Corning, increased 7% in 2008 when compared to 2007, reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the useful lives of certain fixed assets, offset in part by an other than temporary impairment for certain securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our share of this impairment was $18 million. Although Dow Cornings full year results increased year over year, sales and earnings declined significantly in the fourth quarter when compared to the first three quarters of the year as demand in its silicone product lines fell dramatically. In 2007, Dow Cornings sales grew approximately 13% when compared with the prior year due to growth in net sales from both their silicone and polysilicone product lines. Equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2007 were up 3% when compared to 2006 due to the increase in sales offset in part by the non repeat of a $33 million favorable IRS settlement. In 2006, Dow Corning reached a settlement with the IRS regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003. Equity earnings reflected a $33 million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all Federal tax issues related to Dow Cornings implant settlement. Sales at Dow Corning are expected to be lower in 2009 when compared to 2008, driven by lower sales of silicone products offset somewhat by an increase in sales at Hemlock Semiconductor. Consequently, Dow Cornings net income, and Cornings equity in earnings from Dow Corning, is expected to be lower as well. Until December 31, 2007, Corning had a 50% interest in Samsung Corning. Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and affiliates owned the remaining 50% interest in Samsung Corning. On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning were reduced by $40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges. Net Income As a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 5,257 $ 2,150 $ 1,855 Basic earnings per common share $ 3.37 $ 1.37 $ 1.20 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.32 $ 1.34 $ 1.16 Shares used in computing basic per share amounts 1,560 1,566 1,550 Shares used in computing diluted per share amounts 1,584 1,603 1,594 27 Table of Contents OPERATING SEGMENTS Effective January 1, 2008, Corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the companys focus on new business development and later stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our Specialty Materials operating segment. As a result, our segment reporting includes the following changes which are in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information: We have provided separate financial information for the Specialty Materials operating segment. This operating segment was previously included in All Other. Certain later stage development projects, such as microreactors and green lasers, now meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in All Other. Spending for these projects was previously part of Exploratory Research and was reported in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to total net income. Certain other new product lines now meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in All Other. Spending related to these businesses was previously included in our Life Sciences and Display Technologies operating segments. Our reportable operating segments are now as follows: Display Technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays. Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry. Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications. This reportable operating segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. Specialty Materials manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as All Other. This group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines. We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Display Technologies (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales $ 2,724 $ 2,613 $ 2,133 4 23 Income before equity earnings $ 1,321 $ 1,433 $ 1,080 (8 ) 33 Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 900 $ 582 $ 565 55 3 Net income $ 2,221 $ 2,015 $ 1,645 10 22 2008 vs. 2007 The net sales increase for the Display Technologies segment in 2008 resulted from a slight improvement in volume (measured in square feet of glass sold) along with a $294 million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by price declines of 7% when compared to 2007. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. In the first half of 2008, glass volume of this segment increased by 37%, when compared to the same period in 2007 driven by LCD television market growth and demand for LCD monitors and notebook computers. Because Corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers, supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in Cornings volume. During 2008, the LCD glass market underwent a supply chain contraction in the second half of the year that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined. Consequently, in the second half of 2008, our LCD glass volume declined by 27% when compared to the second half of 2007. The largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about 50% when compared to the prior year. 28 Table of Contents The overall LCD glass market grew approximately 15% in 2008. Growth rates by region differed dramatically, resulting in volume in our wholly owned business increasing only 1% while volume at Samsung Corning Precision in Korea increased 28% compared to 2007. The lower growth rate in our wholly owned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in Taiwan, particularly in the second half of the year, reflecting a number of key market dynamics. First, Taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do Korean and Japanese panel makers. In addition, a number of Taiwanese panel makers provide capacity to customers that also produce their own LCD panels, and as demand has slowed, purchases of this excess capacity have declined. Fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made Korean panel makers more competitive during the industry downturn. Finally, we believe the Taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand. When compared to the prior year, income before equity earnings for 2008 was down 8% primarily due to lower volume and price declines, offset somewhat by the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, and strong manufacturing performance earlier in the year. During the first half of 2008, operating performance benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity. As demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter, we temporarily idled certain production assets. These actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier than planned. By the end of 2008, more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our wholly owned business was temporarily idled. This capacity is expected to be brought back on line when demand increases which could be as early as the second quarter of 2009. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precisions LCD business for 2008 increased by 55% when compared to 2007 due to volume gains of 28%, improved manufacturing performance, and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 9%. Samsung Corning Precision experienced a similar, but less severe, decline in second half performance. At the end of 2008, Samsung Corning Precision had idled approximately 25% of its capacity. Equity earnings for 2008 were positively impacted by approximately $210 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2007. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar Japanese yen and U.S. dollar Korean won exchange rates. The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. For 2008, AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, and Sharp Corporation, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 65% of total segment sales when combined. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2008, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and LG Phillips LCD Co., Ltd. accounted for approximately 94% of Samsung Corning Precision sales. 2007 vs. 2006 The net sales increase for 2007 reflected volume gains of 38% offset somewhat by price declines of 11% when compared to 2006. Volume gains were driven by increased LCD monitor demand, continued demand for glass for notebook computers, and LCD television market growth. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements on this segments net sales was not material in 2007 when compared to 2006. When compared with 2006, income before equity earnings for 2007 was up significantly due to higher net sales, lower manufacturing costs, and an increase in royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision. Equity earnings for 2007 increased by 3% when compared to 2006 due to volume gains of 39% at Samsung Corning Precision offset by price declines of 15% and increased operating and royalty expenses. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements on equity earnings was not material in 2007 when compared to 2006. Other Information Corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2008 and 2007, capital spending in this segment was $1.4 billion and $883 million, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2009 to be approximately $700 million of which $525 million relates to construction completed in 2008. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generates royalty income. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for more information about royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision and related party transactions. 29 Table of Contents In 2005 and 2004, several of Cornings customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which Cornings Display Technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. We received our last deposit of $105 million in July 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. In 2006, we received $171 million of customer deposits. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we issued $266 million, $231 million, and $126 million, respectively, in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. In the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers deposits. Refer to Note 10 (Other Liabilities) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Outlook: We expect the Display Technologies segment to continue to be impacted by the global recession. In the first quarter of 2009, we expect the supply chain contraction to continue and volume to be down in the range of 20% to 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. We also expect price declines in the high single digits. As part of the corporate wide restructuring plan, we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter. With continued growth in demand at retail, we anticipate significant volume improvement in the second quarter of 2009 and we anticipate the rate of price declines will return to more normal levels. We expect the overall LCD glass market in 2009 will be flat with 2008, resulting from an increase in demand for LCD televisions and notebook computers offset by falling demand for LCD monitors. In addition, we expect regional mix shifts as described above may cause an increase in volume at Samsung Corning Precision with a corresponding decrease in volume for Cornings wholly owned business. Although the LCD supply chain has been impacted by the current global recession, we believe that the long term drivers of this market, specifically increased penetration of LCD into the total television market, increased screen size and increased televisions per household, remain intact. The end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending, among other things. We are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions, particularly the global economic recession, and world political tensions could have on consumer demand. While the industry has grown rapidly in recent years, economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes; prices; or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. If we do not experience the expected recovery in volume in the second quarter, we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity. Telecommunications (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 920 $ 880 $ 877 5 Hardware and equipment 879 899 852 (2 ) 6 Total net sales $ 1,799 $ 1,779 $ 1,729 1 3 Net income $ 45 $ 118 $ 13 (62 ) 808 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales for the segment were up slightly over 2007 primarily due to volume gains in fiber to the premises products and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Increased sales in fiber to the premises products reflected strong demand in Europe, and North America. The increase was partially offset by moderating price declines, reduced demand for copper based products in Europe and the absence of sales from Cornings European submarine cabling business which was sold in April 2007. 30 Table of Contents Effective April 30, 2007, Corning sold its European submarine cabling business and effective April 1, 2006, Advance Cable Systems (ACS), currently an equity company affiliate, assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in Japan. As a result of these two transactions, sales for 2008, 2007, and 2006 are not comparable. (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Telecommunications segment net sales (GAAP) $ 1,799 $ 1,779 $ 1,729 1 3 Sales of submarine cabling products 39 118 Sales of optical cable in Japan 23 Telecommunications segment net sales excluding the above two items (non GAAP) $ 1,799 $ 1,740 $ 1,588 3 10 Net income in 2008 included $22 million for the cost of a restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in net income in 2008 reflected the impact of the restructuring charge, price declines, higher operating expenses, and the absence of a $19 million gain on the sale of the European submarine cabling business when compared to last year. In 2008, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net income of this segment. The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2008, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales, accounted for 24% of total segment sales when combined. 2007 vs. 2006 Segment net sales in 2007 were favorably impacted by growth in the Telecommunications industry and in the private network market. Growth in the public and private markets had a favorable impact on both optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment product sales. In 2007, Corning introduced the ClearCurve ultra bendable optical fiber based suite of products that enable fiber deployments to multi dwelling units. In 2007, optical fiber market volume exceeded the previous market peak which occurred in 2001, confirming a recovery from the 2002 global telecommunications market downturn. Volume increases in 2007 were offset somewhat by price declines when compared to the previous year. In addition, 2007 net sales were positively impacted by $37 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, when compared to 2006. Telecommunications segment net sales, excluding the impact of sales of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in Japan increased 10 percent in 2007 when compared to 2006. Segment net sales excluding the impact of submarine cabling products and sales of optical cable in Japan is a non GAAP financial measure which management believes is useful to investors to understand the year over year growth of this segments net sales. The reconciliation of this non GAAP measure is included in the table above. Net income in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due to improvements in segment sales, cost reductions, the impact of the $19 million gain on the sale of the European submarine cabling business, and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled $44 million in 2006. A favorable mix for optical fiber and cable products also contributed to improvements in segment net income. In 2007, net income of this segment was positively impacted by $3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared with 2006. Outlook: We expect the Telecommunications segment to be negatively impacted by the global recession with sales in 2009 lower than in 2008. In addition to the fourth quarter restructuring charge, additional charges will be incurred in this segment in the first quarter of 2009. Restructuring actions include a reduction in manufacturing, sales and administrative and development and engineering workforces and a consolidation of manufacturing operations that will result in the closure of two plants, with productive capacity and headcount being increased at another facility. Changes in our customers expected deployment plans, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect sales levels. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. 31 Table of Contents Environmental Technologies (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales: Automotive $ 458 $ 508 $ 451 (10 ) 13 Diesel 253 249 164 2 52 Total net sales $ 711 $ 757 $ 615 (6 ) 23 Net income $ 33 $ 61 $ 8 (46 ) 663 2008 vs. 2007 Sales of the Environmental Technologies segment in 2008 were down 6% when compared to the previous year and reflected lower sales of automotive and diesel products offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Sales of automotive products reflected the significant decline in demand in the European and U.S. automotive industry in the second half of 2008 in line with worsening economic conditions. Diesel product sales increased due to the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by volume declines. Diesel product sales reflect the continued decline in the U.S. freight industry which began in late 2007. Net sales of this segment in 2008 were positively impacted by $24 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. Net income of this segment was down when compared to last year due primarily to reduced sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses. Net income was positively impacted by $3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are mainly to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. In 2008, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 81% of total segment sales. 2007 vs. 2006 Sales of the Environmental Technologies segment in 2007 were higher when compared to 2006 due to increased sales from the diesel product lines and strong demand for automotive substrates. Diesel sales in 2007 reflected increased sales of heavy duty diesel products to meet the U.S. emission regulations which went into effect on January 2, 2007. Sales of automotive products also improved when compared to last year due to an increase in sales to European and Asian customers. Net sales of this segment were positively impacted by $23 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. Net income of this segment was up when compared to last year due to higher sales, manufacturing efficiencies, and the impact of favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by modest price declines. Improved utilization of our diesel manufacturing capacity also contributed to increased net income in this segment. Net income was positively impacted by $5 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. Outlook: We expect performance of this segment in 2009 will continue to be negatively impacted by the global recession. In addition, results will be impacted by changes in the automotive industry and in the status of North Americas largest automakers. We are forecasting net sales of this segment to be lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 with declines in both automotive and diesel businesses. As part of the corporate wide restructuring plan, we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter of 2009. Specialty Materials (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales $ 372 $ 379 $ 386 (2 ) (2 ) Net (loss) income $ (7 ) $ (3 ) $ 20 (133 ) (115 ) 32 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 The Specialty Materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Consequently, this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components, semiconductor optics and components, aerospace and defense, astronomy, ophthalmic products, and telecommunications components. When compared to the previous year, net sales were down 2% in 2008 due to a decline in sales of semiconductor materials products which were negatively impacted by the global recession offset somewhat by increased sales of Gorilla glass and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Gorilla glass is Cornings optical quality glass that is optimized for high end portable devices and touch screens. The increase in net loss for this segment was due to the decline in sales along with higher operating expenses for Gorilla glass. For 2008, one customer of the Specialty Materials segment accounted for 11% of total segment sales. 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales for 2007 reflected a decline in semiconductor materials products offset somewhat by growth in sales of Gorilla glass when compared to 2006. The decline in net income for 2007 reflected the decline in sales along with an increase in manufacturing costs. Outlook: Although we expect sales of Gorilla glass to continue to improve, sales of this segment for 2009 are expected to be down, reflecting the overall decline in economic conditions when compared to 2008. We expect to see a continued decline in sales of semiconductor materials products and declines in advanced optical products. As part of the corporate wide restructuring plan, we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter of 2009. Life Sciences (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales $ 326 $ 305 $ 287 7 6 Net income $ 53 $ 44 $ 27 20 63 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2008 were up when compared to 2007 driven by sales growth of scientific laboratory products in all of this segments global markets, price increases, and $8 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Government and private spending for drug development, discovery, and production, continue to drive market growth in this segment. The improvement in net income in 2008 reflected the sales increases as described offset somewhat by higher operating expenses. In the Life Sciences segment, one customer accounted for approximately 45% of this segments net sales in 2008. 2007 vs. 2006 Net sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2007 were up when compared to the previous year driven by market growth and higher prices. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales for the periods presented. Improved profitability of this segment in 2007 resulted from higher sales, movements in foreign exchange rates, manufacturing efficiencies, and the absence of restructuring charges. Movements in foreign exchange rates had a $4 million favorable impact on results of this segment for 2007 when compared with 2006. Outlook: Sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2009 are expected to be flat to up slightly when compared to 2008. 33 Table of Contents All Other (dollars in millions): % Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Net sales $ 16 $ 27 $ 24 (41 ) 13 Research, development and engineering expenses $ 163 $ 121 $ 101 35 20 Income before equity earnings $ (210 ) $ (150 ) $ (116 ) 40 29 Equity earnings (loss) of affiliated companies $ 42 $ (9 ) $ 39 (567 ) (123 ) Net loss $ (168 ) $ (161 ) $ (82 ) 4 96 2008 vs. 2007 All Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting. This group is primarily comprised of development projects, such as microreactors and synthetic green lasers, and results for new product lines, such as the Epic system. In 2008, the increase in net loss reflected higher spending for new development projects and a $14 million loss on the sale of Cornings Steuben glass business offset somewhat by the absence of restructuring and impairment charges. In 2007, equity earnings of All Other included $40 million for our share of restructuring and impairment charges for Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD businesses. 2007 vs. 2006 In 2007, the increase in net loss resulted from higher spending for new development projects and the impact of restructuring and impairment charges for Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD businesses. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about Samsung Corning Precision and Samsung Corning. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing and Capital Structure The following items impacted Cornings financing and capital structure during 2008: We recognized $53 million of net losses on short term investments. Net losses included other than temporary impairments of $26 million for securities of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in mid September, and $11 million for securities which had declined in value and had been recently down graded. The remaining losses resulted from the sale of asset backed debt securities and debt securities of financial institutions as we reduced our exposure to these sectors. In addition, we have classified $40 million of mortgage backed securities from current assets to long term assets. Through the end of September, we repurchased 29.5 million shares of common stock for $625 million as part of repurchase programs announced in July 2007 and July 2008. In the fourth quarter, we made no additional repurchases. We have a revolving credit facility that provides us access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through March 2011. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $1.9 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2009 capital spending program is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, with approximately $700 million for spending related to manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment. Approximately $525 million of the Display Technologies spending relates to construction completed in 2008. Additionally, approximately $100 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment to support the diesel emissions control products. 34 Table of Contents Cash Flows Summary of cash flow data: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,128 $ 2,077 $ 1,803 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,699 ) $ (561 ) $ (2,181 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (798 ) $ (539 ) $ 180 2008 vs. 2007 As the significant increase in 2008 net income was largely driven by two non cash items, 2008 operating cash increased only slightly when compared to 2007. The two non cash items were the release of $2.5 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a $340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities. In addition, cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital, higher dividends from equity affiliates, and lower contributions for retirement related benefits compared to 2007. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued. Net cash used in investing activities in 2008 increased when compared to the previous year due to a $659 million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the Display Technologies segment and a smaller reduction in short term investments compared to 2007. Net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and an increase in dividends paid. Corning began paying a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 Net cash from operating activities in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due primarily to higher earnings after adjusting for noncash items and increased dividends from equity affiliates. Net cash used in investing activities in 2007 was lower than 2006 due to a net reduction in short term investments compared to a net increase in 2006. This change reflected a shift away from certain short term investments to reduce investment risk. Corning had net cash outflows from financing activities in 2007 compared to net cash inflows in 2006 reflecting the Companys stock repurchase program and dividend payments both of which began in 2007 and reduced cash inflows from the exercise of stock options. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2008, this plan accounted for 83% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91% of the related plans assets. We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2010. In 2008, we made voluntary cash contributions of $50 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $2 million to our international pension plans. In 2007, we made voluntary cash contributions of $131 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $18 million to our international pension plans. In 2008 we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of recent financial market conditions which will increase pension expense for 2009 by $33 million. We anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately $80 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2009. We do not expect to have required contributions in 2009. Refer to Note 12 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 35 Table of Contents Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. Between 2004 and 2007, we received a total of $937 million for customer deposit agreements. We received our last deposit of $105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. In 2006, we received $171 million of customer deposits. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we issued credit memoranda which totaled $266 million, $231 million, and $126 million, respectively. These credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. Customer deposit liabilities were $369 million and $531 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, we expect to issue approximately $287 million in credit memoranda. Restructuring During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we made payments of $17 million, $39 million, and $15 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $22 million restructuring charge primarily for severance costs in our Telecommunications segment. Cash payments for employee related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2009, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010. On January 26, 2009 Corning committed to corporate wide restructuring actions which will result in first quarter charges in the range of $115 million to $165 million pre tax, in addition to the fourth quarter restructuring charges of $22 million. In total, Corning plans to reduce its workforce by 3,500 employees and expects to complete this restructuring plan by the end of 2009. Corning made the decision to restructure to adjust operations to reflect anticipated lower sales in 2009. The program will include a selective early retirement program, global workforce reductions and consolidation of manufacturing facilities. Total cash expenditures are expected to be roughly $105 million to $150 million primarily related to termination benefits. Key Balance Sheet Data Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Working capital $ 2,567 $ 2,782 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ (249 ) $ (734 ) Current ratio 2.3:1 2.1:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 512 $ 856 Days sales outstanding 43 49 Inventories $ 798 $ 631 Inventory turns 4.3 4.7 Days payable outstanding (1) 33 36 Long term debt $ 1,527 $ 1,514 Total debt to total capital 11 % 14 % (1) Includes trade payables only. 36 Table of Contents Credit Ratings As of February 24, 2009, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating Long Term Debt Outlook Last Update Fitch BBB+ Stable June 29, 2007 Standard & Poors BBB+ Stable July 2, 2007 Moodys Baa1 Stable June 19, 2007 Management Assessment of Liquidity The Company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements. We ended 2008 with approximately $2.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Approximately $1.5 billion, or 54% of the total balance, was invested in money market funds, government backed securities, or bank deposits and had average maturities of one day. At December 31, 2008, approximately 42% of the Companys investments were located in the U.S. In January 2009, we repatriated an additional $400 million of cash into the U.S. In 2008, we recorded $53 million of realized losses on short term investments which represented less than 6% of our total holdings of available for sale securities. Refer to Note 3 (Short term Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Like many other highly rated issuers that have enjoyed consistent access to the public capital markets, the recent turmoil in those financial markets may limit Cornings access, constrain issuance amounts available to Corning, and result in terms and conditions that by historical standards are more restrictive and costly to Corning. Still, from time to time, we may issue debt to refinance debt maturities in the next few years and for general corporate purposes. In July 2007, Cornings Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million to be completed by the end of 2008. In July 2008, Corning announced that its Board of Directors and Executive Committee had approved a second stock repurchase program of up to an additional $1 billion to be completed by the end of 2009. Through December 31, 2008, we have repurchased approximately 40 million shares of common stock for $875 million under these programs. We do not intend to make further share repurchases until economic conditions and Cornings cash flow performance improve. Our major source of funding for 2009 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, and dividend payments. Corning also has access to a $1.1 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit through March 2011. This facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: Guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. FIN 45 requires a company, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. 37 Table of Contents Refer to Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under FASB Interpretation 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (FIN 46R). The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by FIN 46R. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. Corning has performed the required FIN 46R assessments and has identified three entities as being variable interest entities. None of these entities are considered to be significant to Cornings consolidated statements of position. Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

(2) Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet. (3) At December 31, 2008, $1,605 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value. (4) At December 31, 2008, $25 million of the $113 million represents imputed interest. (5) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity/expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. (6) At December 31, 2008, $19 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $8 million of that amount will become payable. We have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning discussed in Note 7 (Investments) and Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. 38 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENT We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 19 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had accrued approximately $21 million (undiscounted) and $19 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of assets held for use SFAS 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In certain circumstances, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. Income taxes SFAS 109 requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. In the second quarter of 2008, we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets. In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we released an additional $70 million, and $45 million, respectively, of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of current year U.S. taxable income. A significant factor in our forecasts of future U.S. tax profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our Display Technologies businesses to the U.S. 39 Table of Contents In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide income tax position as well as the effective tax rate. Fair value measures The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) effective January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 was not material to Cornings financial statements or results of operations. The statement identifies two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the companys own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, SFAS 157 requires companies to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. SFAS 157 applies whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and requires the use of observable market data when available. Cornings major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions. Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. In arriving at the fair value of Cornings derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. The amount recorded in the first quarter of 2008 related to credit risk was not material. Probability of litigation outcomes SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS 5) requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case specific issues. See Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives. The proposed asbestos resolution (Amended PCC Plan) is subject to a number of contingencies. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and may face objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is subject to appeal. The proposed Amended PCC Plan will also be subject to a vote of PCCs creditors. For these and other reasons, Cornings liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the cost of resolving the non PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. Other possible liabilities SFAS 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2008, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,342 million. 40 Table of Contents The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Change in Assumption Effect on 2009Pre Tax Pension Expense Effective onDecember 31, 2008 PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5.6 million +$61 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5.6 million $60 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$5.4 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $5.4 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2008, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $82 million before tax, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $81 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Change in Assumption Effect on 2009Pre Tax OPEB Expense Effective onDecember 31, 2008 APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$1 million +$21 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $1 million $21 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue recognition The company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. Stock compensation Stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk free discount rates, expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience, currently available market place data, and forward looking explanatory variables. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings future stock based compensation expense and disclosures. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financials statements. 41 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, forecasts, and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global economic and political conditions; tariffs, import duties and currency fluctuations; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political or financial instability, natural disasters, or major health concerns; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; retention of key personnel; stock price fluctuations; customer acceptance of LCD televisions; a downturn in demand or decline in growth rates for LCD glass substrates; customer ability, most notably in the Display Technologies segment, to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their manufacturing expansions and ongoing operations; fluctuations in supply chain inventory levels; equity company activities, principally at Dow Corning Corporation and Samsung Corning Precision; movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, Euro, and Korean won; and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. 42 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects: exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. We have foreign currency exposure to the Japanese yen, the New Taiwan dollar, the Korean won, and the euro. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in Other (Expense) Income, Net in the consolidated statements of income. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments was $1.3 billion in 2008 and $942 million in 2007 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 72% of this amount in 2008. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $911 million for 2008 and $532 million for 2007. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2008, we had open forward contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2008. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $215 million compared to $239 million at December 31, 2007. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $118 million compared to $146 million at December 31, 2007. As we derive approximately 74% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and euro. Our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2009 remain constant at January 2009 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2009 net sales of approximately $183 million and net income of approximately $215 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2009 net sales of approximately $26 million and net income of approximately $4 million. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2008, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.
