Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. This discussion includes the following sections: Overview Results of Operations Operating Segments Liquidity and Capital Resources Environment Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Forward Looking Statements OVERVIEW Corning delivered strong operating results in 2009 in spite of the recession that followed last years global economic decline and financial market disruption. Although results for most of our operating segments were down when compared to last year, we saw demand for Display Technologies products increase as the year progressed and some strength in our other segments as well. Government incentives helped to improve results in the Environmental Technologies segment in the second half of the year. Results in the Telecommunications segment reflected strength in demand for optical fiber and cable products in China. In the Life Sciences segment, we completed the acquisition of Axygen BioScience, Inc. to support our strategy to expand our portfolio of products and enhance global customer access in this business. We saw an increase in sales of Corning Gorilla&reg; glass, our protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices. We ended the year on a positive note as sales in most of our segments continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009 when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Net income, although substantially lower than the previous year, reflected a number of non operating items in 2008 that were not repeated in the current year. Those items are described more fully in the discussion of our profitability below. In the second half of 2008 and in early 2009, the Company responded to a decline in demand by scaling back manufacturing operations, reducing research, development, and engineering expenses, reducing capital spending, and reducing operating costs. In 2009, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $228 million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments. We faced other challenges this past year, as well. In August, an earthquake halted production at one of the Companys LCD glass manufacturing facilities in Japan. In mid October, production at our LCD glass manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. Production capacity in Taiwan and our ability to quickly resume some manufacturing helped to ease the impact of both of these disruptions. Corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our financial independence. This strategy has served us well. Our key priorities for 2009 are similar to those of the previous four years: protect our financial health and invest in the future. During 2009, we made the following progress on these priorities: Financial Health Despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment, our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities. Significant items in 2009 included the following: Our debt to capital ratio at 11% was unchanged from December 31, 2008. Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion. We ended the year with $3.6 billion of cash and short term investments, which was approximately $800 million higher than last year. Profitability For the year ended December 31, 2009, we generated net income of $2.0 billion or $1.28 per share compared to net income of $5.3 billion or $3.32 per share for 2008. When compared to last year, the decline in net income was due largely to the following items: The absence of certain tax adjustments totaling $2.5 billion which included a $2.4 billion valuation allowance release in 2008 on our deferred tax assets resulting from a change in the judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years. 21 Table of Contents The absence of a credit to asbestos litigation expense of $340 million reflecting the change in the estimate of our asbestos litigation liability compared to expense of $20 million reported in the current year. In the first quarter of 2008, Corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by $327 million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in 2003. For additional information on this matter, refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Lower net income in the Display Technologies segment due to lower volume and lower prices. The impact of restructuring charges in 2009 totaling $228 million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments. The decrease in net income in 2009 was offset somewhat by $393 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates along with lower operating expenses resulting from the Companys restructuring activities. Investing in our future We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems. While our spending levels for research, development and engineering were lower in 2009 when compared to 2008, we remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. We continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises. We continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the Epic system, synthetic green lasers, and advanced flow reactors. In 2010, we are broadening our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities. These opportunities, which include products such as Gorilla&reg; glass for consumer products and thin film photovoltaics for solar applications, leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications. Our research, development and engineering expenditures decreased by $64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008, but remained somewhat constant as a percentage of net sales. Reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. Our capital expenditures have been focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the Display Technologies segment in anticipation of a larger display market in 2010 and growing demand for Cornings Gorilla&reg; glass. In December 2007, we announced a 5 year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporations plant in Sakai City, Japan. We continued to advance this project to align with Sharp Corporations progress on their adjoining facility and in October of 2009, the facility was opened. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. Given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and the decline in demand for our products in late 2008, we stopped further expansion in Taiwan. Total capital expenditures for 2009 were $890 million. Approximately $552 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment in 2009, of which about $525 million related to construction in 2008. Approximately $51 million in 2009 was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment. We expect our 2010 capital spending to be about $600 million to $700 million, but there could also be up to $300 million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities, possible capacity in China, and precious metals to support growing capacity. Approximately $250 million to $350 million will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment. Corporate Outlook Our outlook for 2010 is favorable. Although we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be buffeted by the difficult global economic climate, we believe worldwide demand for LCD glass will continue to increase. We expect sales in 2010 to be higher than 2009 driven by continued strength in demand for LCD televisions, computer notebooks, and desktop monitors. We believe gross margin will expand driven by improvements in the Display and Environmental Technologies segments. We think equity earnings will improve as well. We expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in line with recent years. We will monitor the levels of recovery in certain of our businesses and we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity, where necessary. We will continue to focus on protecting our financial health, controlling our costs, and accelerating new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth. We may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses, such as our recent purchase of Axygen. We remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation, while preserving our financial stability, will enable our continued long term success. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales $ 5,395 $ 5,948 $ 5,860 (9 ) 2 Gross margin $ 2,093 $ 2,738 $ 2,749 (24 ) 0 (gross margin %) 39 % 46 % 47 % Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 881 $ 901 $ 912 (2 ) (1 ) (as a % of net sales) 16 % 15 % 16 % Research, development and engineering expenses $ 563 $ 627 $ 565 (10 ) 11 (as a % of net sales) 10 % 11 % 10 % Restructuring, impairment and other charges (credits) $ 228 $ 19 $ (4 ) * * (as a % of net sales) 4 % 0 % 0 % Asbestos litigation charge (credit) $ 20 $ (340 ) $ 185 * (284 ) (as a % of net sales) 0 % (6 )% 3 % Equity in earnings of affiliated companies $ 1,435 $ 1,358 $ 983 6 38 (as a % of net sales) 27 % 23 % 17 % Income before income taxes $ 1,934 $ 2,882 $ 2,271 (33 ) 27 (as a % of net sales) 36 % 48 % 39 % Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 74 $ 2,375 $ (121 ) (97 ) * (as a % of net sales) 1 % 40 % (2 )% Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated $ 2,008 $ 5,257 $ 2,150 (62 ) 145 (as a % of net sales) 37 % 88 % 37 % * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. Net Sales Net sales in 2009 decreased 9% due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to 2008, driven primarily by volume and price declines in the Display Technologies segment offset somewhat by $194 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. The largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first quarter of 2009 as LCD glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions. Over the remainder of 2009, we saw demand levels for LCD glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and, we believe, a corresponding expansion in the LCD industry supply chain as demand for LCD televisions improved. In the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales increased 41% when compared to the same period last year and 4% when compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by increased net sales in the Display Technologies segment. For the full year of 2009, lower volume in the Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending for telecommunications networks contracted. Net sales in 2008 were up slightly when compared to 2007, primarily due to the positive impact of $354 million from the movement in foreign exchange rates offset by volume and price declines in a number of our segments as sales results followed the changing global economic conditions in 2008. Net sales for the first half of 2008 were up 21% when compared with the first half of 2007, but down 16% for the second half of 2008 when compared to the second half of 2007, as the LCD glass market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened with deteriorating economic conditions. Declines in consumer spending reduced demand for LCD televisions and monitors and automotive products in the second half of 2008. In 2009, net sales into international markets continued to surpass those into the U.S. market. For 2009, net sales into international markets accounted for 76% of net sales. For 2008 and 2007, net sales into international markets accounted for 74% and 72%, respectively, of net sales. 23 Table of Contents Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. Gross Margin For 2009, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales declined when compared to 2008, due primarily to the impact of price declines in the Display Technologies segment and reduced volume in the Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin of 27% in the first quarter of 2009, reflected the sharp decline in net sales as first quarter LCD glass demand continued to fall in response to worsening economic conditions. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin approximated 41% in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2009 and reflected improved demand in a number of our businesses. For 2008, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales was relatively even when compared with 2007. Although gross margin was comparable on a full year basis, in 2008 our gross margin percent remained above 47% in each of the first three quarters and then fell to 28% in the fourth quarter. The decline in gross margin in the fourth quarter resulted from significantly lower volume in our Display Technologies, Telecommunications, and Environmental Technologies segments, the impact of excess idle capacity costs, and accelerated depreciation as we idled the manufacturing capacity in our Display Technologies segment by more than 50%. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses, in dollars, for 2009 were down slightly when compared to 2008, due primarily to the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts and restructuring actions in 2009, offset somewhat by an increase in performance based compensation costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2009 were up slightly because the rate of decline in sales exceeded the rate of decline in spending for selling, general, and administrative costs. The slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 when compared to 2007, in dollars, resulted from a decrease in performance based compensation costs caused by the impact of the decline in profitability in most of our operating segments in the second half of 2008. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses Research, development, and engineering expenses for 2009 decreased by $64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008, but remained constant as a percentage of net sales. Reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. Research, development, and engineering expenses increased by $62 million in 2008 when compared to 2007, but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales. The largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses. Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2009 and in 2008, which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A description of those charges follows: 2009 Restructuring Actions In response to anticipated lower sales in 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million in 2009 primarily for a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce. The charges included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, and the impact of a $32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $155 million, with the majority of spending completed by 2010. We estimate annualized savings from these actions will be about $224 million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. 2008 Restructuring Actions In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded $22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment. 24 Table of Contents Asbestos Litigation In 2009, we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $20 million compared to a net decrease of $340 million in 2008. The net decrease in 2008 was due primarily to a $327 million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2008, as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in 2003. For the remainder of 2008, we recorded net credit adjustments of $13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability. In 2007 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $185 million for the change in the estimated fair value of the components of the asbestos litigation liability under terms established in 2003. Our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be $682 million at December 31, 2009, compared with an estimate of $662 million at December 31, 2008. The entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective, and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of Cornings investment in PCE (currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment). See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter. Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Samsung Corning Precision $ 1,115 $ 927 $ 596 Dow Corning 287 369 345 Samsung Corning (42 ) All other 33 62 84 Total equity earnings $ 1,435 $ 1,358 $ 983 The increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2009 was driven by Samsung Corning Precision when compared to the same period last year. Equity earnings at Samsung Corning Precision reflected increased volume, manufacturing efficiency gains, and the positive impact of $187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to 2008. The 2008 increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies reflected strong sales and earnings performance at both Samsung Corning Precision and Dow Corning when compared to 2007. The change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the Display Technologies segment and in All Other. The decline in equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2009 was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at Dow Corning, offset somewhat by the impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year. Sales at Dow Corning declined 7% in 2009 when compared to the prior year and included volume declines in Dow Cornings traditional silicone businesses that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation (Hemlock), Dow Cornings consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar industries. Sales of Dow Cornings traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in 2009. Sales at Hemlock increased in 2009, driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to 2008. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from Dow Corning. Dow Cornings 2008 performance was driven by sales growth in its traditional silicone product lines and at Hemlock. Dow Corning sales grew 10% in 2008 with the largest growth at Hemlock. Sales of Dow Cornings traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to 2007. Net income at Dow Corning, and Cornings resulting equity earnings from Dow Corning, increased 7% in 2008 when compared to 2007, reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the useful lives of certain fixed assets, offset in part by an other than temporary impairment for certain securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our share of this impairment was $18 million. 25 Table of Contents Sales at Dow Corning in 2010 are expected to increase greater than 10% when compared to 2009, driven by higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at Hemlock. When compared to 2009, equity earnings of Dow Corning are expected to improve in 2010 offset somewhat by an increase in costs for additional capacity. In the first quarter of 2010, equity earnings from Dow Corning are expected to be down when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by seasonably lower sales at Hemlock. Until December 31, 2007, Corning had a 50% interest in Samsung Corning. Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and affiliates owned the remaining 50% interest in Samsung Corning. On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning were reduced by $40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net in Cornings consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision $ 232 $ 184 $ 141 Foreign currency exchange and hedge (losses) / gains (54 ) (112 ) 29 Net realized losses of available for sale securities (2 ) (53 ) (6 ) Loss on sale of Steuben glass business (14 ) Gain on sale of Cornings submarine cabling business 19 Loss on repurchase of debt, net (15 ) Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (6 ) 1 (3 ) Other, net 3 (28 ) (21 ) Total $ 173 $ (22 ) $ 144 Income Before Income Taxes In addition to the items identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits), Asbestos Litigation (Credit) Charges, and Other (Expense) Income, Net, movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented. In 2009, Income Before Income Taxes included $414 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2008. In 2008, Income Before Income Taxes, included $35 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year. Provision for Income Taxes Our (benefit) provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ (74 ) $ (2,375 ) $ 121 Effective income tax (benefit) rate (3.8 )% (82.4 )% 5.3 % The effective income tax rate for 2009 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions; The benefit of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit for years 2005 2009; The benefit of recording additional deferred taxes for the tax exempt subsidy attributable to our OPEB liability; and The impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets. The effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2008 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The release of $2.5 billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets in future years, described below; The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; 26 Table of Contents The benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions; and A $40 million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the Canadian Revenue Agency. The effective income tax rate for 2007 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; and The benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions. Prior to 2007, we recorded valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the U.S. In 2007, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. As more fully described in Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances until the second quarter of 2008. At that time, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the U.S. As a result, we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance was needed. The evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective. Following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008: Positive pre tax income in the U.S. for the first half of 2008 and the preceding year; The impact of positive results in the Display Technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this segment; The number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards; and Increased confidence in our longer term forecasted income levels, which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses. At June 30, 2008, the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment, but were less heavily weighted than our positive evidence: Uncertainty of future taxable earnings; Historical utilization of deferred tax assets caused largely by non recurring items; and Economic and consumer demand uncertainty. Deferred tax liabilities totaled $26 million at December 31, 2008, and therefore, were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion dollars will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009. Of that amount, $3.6 billion of U.S. profits will be required over the next 16 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards. In 2008 and 2007, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of the valuation allowances, and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S., was a reduction in our effective tax rate of 8.6 and 8.1 percentage points for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other federal and state tax credits, will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of December 31, 2009, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire. The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $245 million and $230 million, respectively. 27 Table of Contents We do not provide income taxes on the post 1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax free without significant cost. Income taxes have been provided for post 1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover tax free. Unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested. We currently provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2009, U.S. taxes have not been provided on approximately $7.3 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings. In 2004, we recorded valuation allowances against our entire German deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years. In 2007, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the German national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required. The impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 7.1 percentage points for 2007. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2013 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 7.3, 5.3 and 6.9 percentage points for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters. Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated As a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated $ 2,008 $ 5,257 $ 2,150 Basic earnings per common share $ 1.30 $ 3.37 $ 1.37 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.28 $ 3.32 $ 1.34 Shares used in computing per share amounts Basic earnings per common share 1,550 1,560 1,566 Diluted earnings per common share 1,568 1,584 1,603 OPERATING SEGMENTS Effective January 1, 2008, Corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the Companys focus on new business development and later stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our Specialty Materials operating segment. As a result, our segment reporting includes the following changes that are in accordance with the requirements for disclosures about segments: We have provided separate financial information for the Specialty Materials operating segment. This operating segment was previously included in All Other. Certain later stage development projects, such as advanced flow reactors and green lasers, meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in All Other. Spending for these projects was previously part of Exploratory Research and was reported in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to total net income. Certain other new product lines meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in All Other. Spending related to these businesses was previously included in our Life Sciences and Display Technologies operating segments. Our reportable operating segments are now as follows: Display Technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays. Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry. Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications. This reportable operating segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. 28 Table of Contents Specialty Materials manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as All Other. This group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines. We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2009, we began providing U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) on U.S. earnings (losses) due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2008. As a result of the change in our tax position, we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in 2009 to reflect this difference. The impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant. Display Technologies (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales $ 2,426 $ 2,724 $ 2,613 (11 ) 4 Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 1,102 $ 916 $ 596 20 54 Net income $ 1,992 $ 2,221 $ 2,015 (10 ) 10 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in net sales in 2009, reflected price declines of 19% and a decline in volume of 2% (measured in square feet of glass sold) offset somewhat by the positive impact of $228 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. When compared to last year, the volume decline in 2009 occurred largely in the first quarter of 2009 and reflected a number of industry dynamics. Because Corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers, supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in Cornings volume. During the second half of 2008, the LCD market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined. We believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of 2009, followed by replenishment in the second quarter. Over the remainder of 2009, we saw demand levels for LCD glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels. In the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales increased 84% when compared to the same period last year and 6% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. With increasing demand over the course of 2009, we strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of last year. In the third quarter of 2009, an earthquake in Shizuoka, Japan halted production at the Companys LCD glass manufacturing facility located there. In the fourth quarter of 2009, production at the Companys LCD glass manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. Incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support LCD glass shipments. We believe our market share was negatively impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust. The Company incurred approximately $30 million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs from these events. In 2009, equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision reflected the positive impact of $187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in volume of 35% offset somewhat by price declines of 20% when compared to the same period last year. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar Japanese yen and U.S. dollar Korean won exchange rates. Results of Samsung Corning Precision reflected improvements in the overall LCD glass market which grew approximately 20% in 2009 when compared to previous year. The economic recession has had a greater impact on our wholly owned business in Taiwan than on Samsung Corning Precision. Since Taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition, they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand. 29 Table of Contents When compared to 2008, the decline in net income in 2009 was primarily due to the impact of volume and price declines, costs associated with the earthquake in Japan, and restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009. These items were offset somewhat by $342 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity earnings. Net income of this segment in 2009 included $31 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. Net income also includes royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision, which was higher in 2009 when compared to last year reflecting the improvements in sales volume at Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate royalty income. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about related party transactions. 2008 vs. 2007 The net sales increase for the Display Technologies segment in 2008 resulted from a slight improvement in volume (measured in square feet of glass sold) along with a $294 million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by price declines of 7% when compared to 2007. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. In the first half of 2008, glass volume of this segment increased by 37%, when compared to the same period in 2007 driven by LCD television market growth and demand for LCD monitors and notebook computers. In the second half of 2008, as a result of worsening global economic conditions, our LCD glass volume declined by 27% when compared to the second half of 2007. The largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about 50% when compared to the prior year. The overall LCD glass market grew approximately 15% in 2008. Growth rates by region differed dramatically, resulting in volume in our wholly owned business increasing only 1% while volume at Samsung Corning Precision in Korea increased 28% compared to 2007. The lower growth rate in our wholly owned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in Taiwan, particularly in the second half of the year, and reflected a number of key market dynamics. As described above, Taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do Korean and Japanese panel makers. In addition, a number of Taiwanese panel makers were providing capacity to customers that also produce their own LCD panels, and as demand has slowed, purchases of this excess capacity declined. Fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made Korean panel makers more competitive during the industry downturn in 2008. Finally, we believe the Taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand. When compared to 2007, net income for 2008 was up 10% primarily due to improvements in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision and the positive impact of movement in foreign exchange rates. These improvements were offset somewhat by lower volume and price declines in Cornings wholly owned business. During the first half of 2008, operating performance at Cornings wholly owned business benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity. As demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter, we temporarily idled certain production assets. These actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier than planned. By the end of 2008, more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our wholly owned business was temporarily idled. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precisions LCD business for 2008 increased by 54% when compared to 2007, due to volume gains of 28%, improved manufacturing performance, and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 9%. Samsung Corning Precision experienced a similar, but less severe, decline in second half performance. At the end of 2008, Samsung Corning Precision had idled approximately 25% of its capacity. Equity earnings for 2008 were positively impacted by approximately $210 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2007. Other Information The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. For 2009 and 2008, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 62% and 65%, respectively, of total segment sales when combined. Our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market. We believe panel makers in Taiwan have been more significantly impacted by the economic downturn given their relative size when compared to Korean panel makers who have a stronger presence in the end market for LCD products. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues, our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2009 and 2008, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea accounted for 93% and 94%, respectively, of Samsung Corning Precision sales. 30 Table of Contents Corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, capital spending in this segment was $552 million, $1.4 billion, and $883 million, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2010 to be approximately $250 million to $350 million. In 2005 and 2004, several of Cornings customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which Cornings Display Technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. We received our last deposit of $105 million in July 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we issued $253 million, $266 million, and $231 million, respectively, in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. In the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers deposits. Refer to Note 11 (Other Liabilities) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Outlook: We expect the overall LCD glass market in 2010, measured in square feet of glass, will increase by approximately 14% to 22% when compared to 2009, resulting from increased demand for LCD televisions and computer notebook sales. We expect gross margin to expand in 2010 driven by increased volume, cost reduction, and moderate price declines. We think regional market share will stabilize although regional mix shifts as described, that benefit volume at Samsung Corning Precision more than Cornings wholly owned business, remain possible. We will also pursue growth opportunities in China as that countrys LCD TV market continues to grow. Although the LCD supply chain has been impacted by the global recession, we believe that the long term drivers of this market, specifically increased penetration of LCD into the total television market, increased screen size and increased televisions per household, remain intact. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect volume at our wholly owned business to increase 8% to 12% and volume at Samsung Corning Precision to be flat to up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect moderate price declines in the first quarter of 2010 at both our wholly owned business and Samsung Corning Precision when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending, among other things. We are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions, particularly the global economic recession, and world political tensions could have on consumer demand. While the industry has grown rapidly in recent years, economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, prices, or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. We may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. Telecommunications (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 909 $ 920 $ 880 (1 ) 5 Hardware and equipment 768 879 899 (13 ) (2 ) Total net sales $ 1,677 $ 1,799 $ 1,779 (7 ) 1 Net income $ 19 $ 45 $ 118 (58 ) (62 ) 2009 vs. 2008 In 2009, net sales of this segment decreased when compared to the same period last year and reflected declines across all of our businesses. When compared to the previous year, lower volumes in both North America and Europe were offset somewhat by higher net sales for optical fiber and cable in China as the country continues to expand its telecommunications infrastructure. Volume in North America and Europe reflected the continuing impact of the economic recession. In addition, net sales of this segment were negatively impacted by $23 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. 31 Table of Contents For 2009, the decline in net income reflected the volume impacts as described above and the impact of restructuring charges, offset somewhat by lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring actions when compared to 2008. Net income of this segment included the impact of $42 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan. Actions in this segment included workforce reductions, the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented. The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2009, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 12% of total segment net sales. In 2008 and 2007, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales, collectively accounted for 24% and 25%, respectively, of total segment sales when combined. 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales for the segment were up slightly over 2007 primarily due to volume gains in fiber to the premises products and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Increased sales in fiber to the premises products reflected strong demand in Europe, and North America. The increase was partially offset by moderating price declines, reduced demand for copper based products in Europe and the absence of sales from Cornings European submarine cabling business that was sold in April 2007. Net income in 2008 included $17 million for the cost of a restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The decline in net income in 2008 reflected the impact of the restructuring charge, price declines, higher operating expenses, and the absence of a $19 million gain on the sale of the European submarine cabling business when compared to 2007. In 2008, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net income of this segment. Outlook: We expect net sales of the Telecommunications segment to be down in 2010, driven by a decline in demand for private and public network products, lower spending for telecommunications infrastructure in China in 2010, and lower sales due to the exit of certain businesses in 2009. Changes in our customers expected deployment plans, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect sales levels. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect net sales of this segment to be down 10% to 15%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, due to lower demand for private network products and fiber demand in China. Environmental Technologies (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales: Automotive $ 360 $ 458 $ 508 (21 ) (10 ) Diesel 230 253 249 (9 ) 2 Total net sales $ 590 $ 711 $ 757 (17 ) (6 ) Net income $ (42 ) $ 33 $ 61 (227 ) (46 ) 2009 vs. 2008 When compared to 2008, net sales for 2009 were negatively impacted by lower automotive production caused by the global recession and subsequent inventory reductions at automotive manufacturers and dealers. In the first quarter of 2009, U.S. automotive builds were at their lowest levels since Corning entered this business. In the first half of 2009, net sales of this segment declined 40% when compared to the first half of 2008. In the second half of 2009, year over year net sales were up 14% when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in China, Europe and the U.S. In addition, we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also caused increased demand. Diesel product sales in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession driven weak freight industry in the U.S. This was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of 2009 as engine manufacturers prepared for next years stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards. Net sales in 2009 were negatively impacted by $9 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period last year. 32 Table of Contents Net loss in 2009 reflected lower sales and manufacturing volume of both automotive and diesel products, offset somewhat by lower operating expenses, when compared to net income 2008. In addition, net loss of this segment in 2009 included the impact of restructuring charges. Restructuring charges for this segment totaled $28 million for the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to lower sales in 2009. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this operating segment. The Environmental Technologies reportable operating segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Our customers and their customers are experiencing the negative impact of the automotive and freight industry downturns. For 2009, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 85% of total segment sales. For 2008 and 2007, net sales to those same three customers accounted for 81% of total segment sales. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers, our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales of the Environmental Technologies segment in 2008 were down 6% when compared to the previous year and reflected lower sales of automotive and diesel products, offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Sales of automotive products reflected the significant decline in demand in the European and U.S. automotive industry in the second half of 2008 in line with worsening economic conditions. Diesel product sales increased due to the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by volume declines. Diesel product sales reflect the continued decline in the U.S. freight industry that began in late 2007. Net sales of this segment in 2008 were positively impacted by $24 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year. Net income of this segment was down when compared to last year, due primarily to reduced sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses. Net income was positively impacted by $3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year. Outlook: We expect net sales of this segment to improve in 2010 driven by moderate growth in demand for automotive products. We expect to see continued strength in demand due to replenishment of dealer and supply chain inventories through the first quarter of 2010. Diesel product sales are expected to improve slightly driven by regulation tightening, but will not reflect any significant growth until the freight industry recovers and excess fleet inventory is fully utilized. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales of this segment in the first quarter of 2010, are expected to start strongly but decline 10% in the full quarter as the rebuild of auto inventories nears completion. Specialty Materials (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales $ 331 $ 372 $ 379 (11 ) (2 ) Net loss $ (54 ) $ (7 ) $ (3 ) * * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2009 vs. 2008 The Specialty Materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Consequently, this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include consumer electronics, display optics and components, semiconductor optics and components, aerospace and defense, astronomy, ophthalmic products, and telecommunications components. 33 Table of Contents Net sales decreased in 2009 due primarily to lower sales of semiconductor optics and components as a result of the significant market downturn when compared to the prior year. This decrease was offset somewhat by an increase in sales of Gorilla&reg; glass, a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices. Sales of Gorilla&reg; glass have continued to increase as the Company moves to capitalize on market opportunities for this product. The net loss for 2009 resulted from the decline in net sales along with manufacturing development costs for Gorilla&reg; glass when compared to 2008. The net loss in 2009 also included $17 million of restructuring charges for the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009, and costs associated with closing one of this segments manufacturing facilities. In 2009, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the profitability of this segment. In the Specialty Materials segment, there were no individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of this segments net sales for 2009. 2008 vs. 2007 When compared to the previous year, net sales were down 2% in 2008 due to a decline in sales of semiconductor materials products that were negatively impacted by the global recession, offset somewhat by increased sales of Gorilla&reg; glass and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. The increase in net loss for this segment was due to the decline in sales along with higher operating expenses for Gorilla&reg; glass. For 2008, one customer of the Specialty Materials segment accounted for 11% of total segment sales. Outlook: For 2010, we expect sales of this segment to increase driven by increased sales of Gorilla&reg; glass when compared to 2009. We expect a modest increase in sales of semiconductor products as the semiconductor industry begins to improve. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be down 10% to 15%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Life Sciences (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales $ 366 $ 326 $ 305 12 7 Net income $ 39 $ 53 $ 44 (26 ) 20 2009 vs. 2008 For 2009, the increase in net sales of this segment reflected sales from the acquisition of Axygen, which was completed in the third quarter of 2009, offset somewhat by volume declines in the Companys existing life sciences products. Sales of Axygen products were approximately $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009, the decline in net income resulted primarily from acquisition related costs and the impact of $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan, when compared to the 2008. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this operating segment in 2009. For 2009, two customers in the Life Sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45% of total segment sales. For 2008 and 2007, one customer accounted for 45% and 44%, respectively, of total segment sales. 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2008 were up when compared to 2007 driven by sales growth of scientific laboratory products in all of this segments global markets, price increases, and $8 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Government and private spending for drug development, discovery, and production, fueled market growth in this segment. The improvement in net income in 2008 reflected the sales increases as described offset somewhat by higher operating expenses. Outlook: Sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2010 are expected to be up primarily due to the acquisition of Axygen when compared to 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be even with or up 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 34 Table of Contents All Other (dollars in millions): % change 2009 2008 2007 09 vs. 08 08 vs. 07 Net sales $ 5 $ 16 $ 27 (69 ) (41 ) Research, development and engineering expenses $ 125 $ 163 $ 121 (23 ) 35 Equity earnings (loss) of affiliated companies $ 32 $ 56 $ 18 (43 ) 211 Net loss $ (80 ) $ (168 ) $ (161 ) * * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2009 vs. 2008 All Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting. This group is primarily comprised of development projects, such as advanced flow reactors and synthetic green lasers, and results for new product lines, such as the Epic system. This segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD glass businesses and the results of Corsam Technologies LLC (Corsam), an equity affiliate established between Corning and Samsung Corning Precision to provide glass technology research. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) for additional information about Samsung Corning Precision and related party transactions. The decrease in this segments net loss for 2009 resulted primarily from lower operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2009, cost reduction efforts, and the impact of the change in the Companys tax position. Net loss of this segment for 2009 included $4 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan. 2008 vs. 2007 In 2008, the increase in net loss reflected higher spending for new development projects and a $14 million loss on the sale of Cornings Steuben glass business, offset somewhat by the absence of restructuring and impairment charges. In 2007, equity earnings of All Other included $40 million for our share of restructuring and impairment charges for Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD businesses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing and Capital Structure The following items impacted Cornings financing and capital structure during 2009 and 2008: In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded the impact of a capital lease obligation for a manufacturing facility associated with our Display Technologies segment. The balance of this obligation at December 31, 2009 was $150 million. In the second quarter of 2009, we issued $250 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes and $100 million of 7% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 15, 2019, and May 15, 2024, respectively. The net proceeds of $346 million were designated for general corporate purposes. In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we recognized $53 million of net losses on short term investments. Net losses included other than temporary impairments of $26 million for securities of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in mid September, and $11 million for securities which had declined in value and been down graded. The remaining losses resulted from the sale of asset backed debt securities and debt securities of financial institutions as we reduced our exposure to these sectors. In addition, we classified $40 million of mortgage backed securities from current assets to long term assets. Through the end of September 2008, we repurchased 29.5 million shares of common stock for $625 million as part of repurchase programs announced in July 2007 and July 2008. We have made no additional repurchases. We have access to a $1.1 billion committed, unsecured, multi currency credit facility. This credit facility expires in November 2011. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. 35 Table of Contents Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $890 million, $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital spending in 2009 was driven primarily by projects in our Display Technologies segment that were started in 2008. Capital spending in 2008 and 2007 primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2010 capital spending program is expected to be approximately $600 million to $700 million, but there could also be up to $300 million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities, possible capacity in China, and precious metals to support growing capacity. Approximately $250 million to $350 million will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment. Cash Flows Summary of cash flow data: Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,077 $ 2,128 $ 2,077 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,370 ) $ (1,699 ) $ (561 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (15 ) $ (798 ) $ (539 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Although 2009 net income decreased significantly from 2008, operating cash flow declined only slightly. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from two non recurring, non cash items: the release of $2.5 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a $340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities. When compared to 2008, operating cash flow in 2009 reflected higher pension contributions and restructuring payments, offset somewhat by an increase in cash from changes in working capital and higher dividends from equity affiliates. Net cash used in investing activities was lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 due to lower capital expenditures in our Display Technologies segment, offset partially by the acquisition of Axygen. Net cash used in financing activities also decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due to the issuance of long term debt and the discontinuation of common stock repurchases. 2008 vs. 2007 As the significant increase in 2008 net income was largely driven by two non cash items, 2008 operating cash increased only slightly when compared to 2007. The two non cash items were the release of $2.5 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a $340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities. In addition, cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital, higher dividends from equity affiliates, and lower contributions for retirement related benefits compared to 2007. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued. Net cash used in investing activities in 2008 increased when compared to the previous year due to a $659 million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the Display Technologies segment and a smaller reduction in short term investments compared to 2007. Net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and an increase in dividends paid. Corning began paying a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2009, this plan accounted for 81% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 90% of the related plans assets. We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2010. In 2009, we made voluntary cash contributions of $75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $5 million to our international pension plans. In 2008, we made voluntary cash contributions of $50 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $2 million to our international pension plans. 36 Table of Contents In 2008, we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by $33 million. In 2009, actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable. Although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2010, we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to $230 million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2010. Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. Between 2004 and 2007, we received a total of $937 million for customer deposit agreements. We received our last deposit of $105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we issued credit memoranda which totaled $253 million, $266 million, and $231 million, respectively. These credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. Customer deposit liabilities were $104 million and $369 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, we expect to issue approximately $80 million in credit memoranda. Restructuring In 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million associated with a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. The charge included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, asset write offs, and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $155 million primarily related to termination benefits. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we made payments of $89 million, $17 million, and $39 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges (Credits)) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Key Balance Sheet Data Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): December 31, 2009 2008 Working capital $ 3,982 $ 2,567 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 399 $ (249 ) Current ratio 3.6:1 2.3:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 753 $ 512 Days sales outstanding 44 43 Inventories $ 579 $ 798 Inventory turns 5.1 4.3 Days payable outstanding (1) 36 33 Long term debt $ 1,930 $ 1,527 Total debt to total capital 11 % 11 % (1) Includes trade payables only. 37 Table of Contents Credit Ratings As of February 10, 2010, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating long term debt Outlook last update Fitch BBB+ Stable June 29, 2007 Standard & Poors BBB+ Stable July 2, 2007 Moodys Baa1 Negative March 24, 2009 Management Assessment of Liquidity We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with $3.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The Company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. At December 31, 2009 about half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the U.S. Almost all of the amounts held outside of the U.S. are available for repatriation, subject to relevant tax consequences. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We expect accumulated non U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. In 2009, realized gains and losses on available for sale securities were not significant. In 2008, we recorded $53 million of net realized losses on short term investments which represented less than 6% of our total holdings of available for sale securities at that time. Refer to Note 3 (Available for Sale Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In July 2007, Cornings Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million to be completed by the end of 2008. In July 2008, Corning announced that its Board of Directors and Executive Committee had approved a second stock repurchase program of up to an additional $1 billion to be completed by the end of 2009. Through December 31, 2008, we had repurchased approximately 40 million shares of common stock for $875 million under these programs. There were no repurchases in 2009. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues. Our major source of funding for 2010 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, and dividend payments. Corning also has access to a $1.1 billion unsecured committed credit through November 2011. If market conditions are favorable, the Company may seek to enter into negotiations with its bank group prior to the expiration date to renew and extend the credit arrangements. The existing credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our leverage using this measure was 11%. The required interest coverage ratio, which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility, compared to interest expense, is a ratio of at least 3.5 times. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 30.3 times and 43.5 times, respectively. Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby a default on one debt obligation of the Company in excess of a specified amount, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such provisions. 38 Table of Contents Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: Guarantee contracts; and Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities. The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. Corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities. None of these entities is considered to be significant to Cornings consolidated statements of position. Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity. Contractual Obligations The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions): Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Total Less than1 year 1 to 2years 2 to 3years 3 to 4years 5 years andthereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 58 $ 28 $ 10 $ 3 $ 17 Credit facilities for equity companies 125 25 25 25 $ 25 25 Stand by letters of credit (1) 60 59 1 Loan guarantees 9 9 Subtotal of commitment expirations per period $ 252 $ 112 $ 36 $ 28 $ 25 $ 51 Purchase obligations $ 63 $ 37 $ 12 $ 7 $ 5 $ 2 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 217 217 Total debt (3) 1,706 72 23 21 122 1,468 Minimum rental commitments 201 41 34 28 24 74 Capital leases (3)(4) 385 16 43 13 13 300 Interest on long term debt (5) 1,334 111 107 107 107 902 Uncertain tax positions (6) 9 3 2 2 2 Subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period 3,915 497 221 178 273 2,746 Total commitments and contingencies $ 4,167 $ 609 $ 257 $ 206 $ 298 $ 2,797 (1) At December 31, 2009, $41 million of the $60 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet. 39 Table of Contents (3) At December 31, 2009, $2.0 billion was included on our balance sheet. Total debt above is stated at maturity value. (4) At December 31, 2009, $151 million of the $385 million represents imputed interest. (5) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. (6) At December 31, 2009, $16 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $7 million of that amount will become payable. We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy related take or pay contracts. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. ENVIRONMENT Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 21 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Corning had accrued approximately $26 million (undiscounted) and $21 million (undiscounted), respectively, for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Companys liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow. Impairment of assets held for use We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets. This review considers all of the Companys precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include: A significant decrease in the market price of an asset; A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset; A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. 40 Table of Contents For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the majority of our reporting segments, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For long lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. The fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include: market size and growth, market share, projected selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our long lived assets were not recoverable. At December 31, 2009 the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by $193 million. At December 31, 2008, the fair market value of precious metals was lower than our carrying value by $598 million. Currently these precious metal assets, primarily in the Display Technologies segment, are recoverable as part of their asset groupings. There is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products of our Display Technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability. Impairment of goodwill We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process. This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows. Our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. As disclosed in Note 10 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Cornings goodwill relates primarily to the Telecommunications, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences operating segments. Telecommunications Goodwill for the Telecommunication segment is tested at the operating segment level. We have aggregated the Telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses; the vertically integrated nature of these operations; shared assets, operating and finance resources, and management; the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment; and the shared support and benefit from common research and development activity. 41 Table of Contents Results for the Telecommunications segment in 2009 were down when compared with 2008. We expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to be negatively impacted by the global recession with lower sales in 2010 than in 2009. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009 and 10% was used in 2008. We determined a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion. Specialty Materials Goodwill for the Specialty Materials segment is tested at the component level, which is one level below an operating segment, because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment. Although the Specialty Materials segment had small reported losses in 2009 and 2008, we expect in the near term new products will partially offset some of the declines resulting from recent economic conditions, and we anticipate growth in new products will also improve longer term profitability. The results of our impairment test in 2009 and 2008 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its book value. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009 and 10% was used in 2008. We determined a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion. Life Sciences In 2009, the Life Sciences segment recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Axygen. Goodwill for the Life Sciences segment is tested at the operating segment level. We have aggregated the Life Sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses. Results in the Life Sciences segment in 2009 reflected the impact of acquisition related costs and $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan, when compared to 2008. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 8% was used in 2009. We determined a range of discount rates between 6% and 10% would not have affected our conclusion. Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions We are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment. We are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. Income taxes We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. In the second quarter of 2008, we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets. A key trend included in our projections was the rate of penetration of LCD televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household, faster LCD television replacement rates, the continued decline of cathode ray tube products, and growth in emerging markets such as China. Another key trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth. In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we released an additional $70 million, and $45 million, respectively, of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of U.S. taxable income. Significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included: the long term stabilization of U.S. income from forecasted royalty income in our Display Technologies operating segment, the long term growth of our diesel business, and the future success of new products. 42 Table of Contents In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide income tax position, as well as the effective tax rate. Equity method investments At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $4.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 94% of the balance. We review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired. When such indicators are present, we then perform an in depth review for impairment. An impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable. Fair value measures As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Companys own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement. In addition, observable market data must be used when available. Cornings major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions. Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. In arriving at the fair value of Cornings derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. Amounts related to credit risk are not material. Probability of litigation outcomes We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case specific issues. See Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives. The proposed asbestos resolution (Amended PCC Plan) is subject to a number of contingencies. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and faces objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is subject to appeal. The proposed Amended PCC Plan is also subject to a vote of PCCs creditors. For these and other reasons, Cornings liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the cost of resolving the non PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. Other possible liabilities We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. 43 Table of Contents Variable interest entities The Company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities. These investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether Corning is a primary beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests. A variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. A company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a VIE is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE and if a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk, the evaluation of contractual arrangements, and assessments about forecasted information. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, changes in these judgments or estimates could affect Cornings results. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2009, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,465 million. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Change in assumption Effect on 2010pre tax pension expense Effect onDecember 31, 2009 PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5.0 million +$64 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5.0 million $62 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$5.3 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $5.3 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2009, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $87 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $85 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Change in assumption Effect on 2010pre tax OPEB expense Effect onDecember 31, 2009 APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$1 million +$23 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $1 million $23 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. 44 Table of Contents Stock compensation Stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk free discount rates, expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience, currently available market place data, and forward looking explanatory variables. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings future stock based compensation expense and disclosures. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, forecasts, and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects: Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. We have foreign currency exposure to the Japanese yen, euro, New Taiwan dollar and Korean won. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in Other (Expense) Income, Net in the consolidated statements of income. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments were $1.4 billion in 2009 and 2008 with foreign based affiliates comprising over 78% of this amount in 2009. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision totaled $1.1 billion for 2009 and $927 million for 2008. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2009, we had open forward contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2009. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $278 million compared to $215 million at December 31, 2008. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $131 million compared to $118 million at December 31, 2008. Specific to the euro, a 10% adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $107 million compared to $68 million at December 31, 2008. As we derive approximately 76% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and euro. Our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2010 remain constant at January 2010 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately $246 million and net income of approximately $340 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately $34 million and net income of approximately $8 million. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2009, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.
