Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. This discussion includes the following sections: Overview Results of Operations Operating Segments Liquidity and Capital Resources Environment Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Forward Looking Statements OVERVIEW Operating results improved in all of our operating segments in 2010 when compared to last year. Despite supply chain variability in the LCD market, operating results in our Display Technologies segment were up significantly in 2010 compared to 2009, due to robust retail demand for LCD products. Strength in enterprise network products sales, coupled with cost reduction efforts, drove higher results in our Telecommunications segment in 2010 when compared to last year. In addition, sales increased in 2010 in our Environmental Technologies segment reflecting improvements in the global automotive market and in the truck market in the United States. Results in our Specialty Materials segment were significantly higher in 2010 compared to 2009, driven by strong demand for Corning Gorilla glass and our display optics and components products. Results in the Life Sciences segment were higher due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed at the end of the third quarter of 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings comparisons to last year also benefited from certain non operating items that are described in our discussion of profitability below. Corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our financial independence. This strategy has served us well. Our key priorities for 2010 were similar to those of the previous four years: protect our financial health and invest in the future. During 2010, we made the following progress on these priorities: Financial Health Despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment, our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities. Significant items in 2010 included the following: Our debt to capital ratio at 11% was unchanged from December 31, 2009. Operating cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion. We ended the year with over $6.3 billion of cash and short term investments, which was approximately $2.8 billion higher than last year. Profitability For the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated net income of $3.6 billion or $2.25 per share compared to net income of $2.0 billion or $1.28 per share for 2009. When compared to last year, the increase in net income was due largely to the following items: Higher net income in the Display Technologies segment reflected strong demand for LCD glass at both our wholly owned business and our equity affiliate Samsung Corning Precision, offset somewhat by lower prices. Higher net income in the Environmental Technologies segment reflected higher volumes in both automotive and diesel products, as well as improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction efforts. A tax benefit in the amount of $265 million for excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. An increase of $157 million or 55% in equity earnings from our equity affiliate Dow Corning resulting from improved volume at Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation (Hemlock), Dow Cornings consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries, and non recurring favorable tax items in the amount of $63 million. 22 Table of Contents Settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims impacting our Display Technologies segment in the amount of $324 million (pre tax), coupled with the absence of related costs in the amount of $30 million for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs recorded in 2009. The absence of restructuring charges in 2009 totaling $228 million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments. The increase in net income in 2010 was favorably impacted by $226 million from the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Investing in our future We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems. We remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. We continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises. In 2010, we broadened our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities. These opportunities, which include products such as Corning Gorilla glass for consumer products and thin film photovoltaics for solar applications, leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications. While we continued to make investments in these promising technologies in 2010, we decided to discontinue our development and commercialization of synthetic green laser technologies in the fourth quarter. In 2011, our innovation strategy will continue to focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities. Our research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $40 million in 2010 when compared to 2009, but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. In the third quarter of 2010, we announced multi year investment plans for additional manufacturing capacity that will benefit a number of our segments. The plans include $800 million for spending associated with a new LCD glass substrate facility in the Peoples Republic of China to meet expected growing demand for our LCD glass. Spending for this facility began in September of 2010 and we expect production to begin in 2012. Additional investments will include construction projects in other regions to expand capacity for Eagle XG&reg; LCD glass substrates and will benefit our Specialty Materials segment by providing capacity for increased demand of Corning Gorilla glass. The plans also include spending in the Environmental Technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in Shanghai, China and Kaiserslautern, Germany. Additionally, the plans establish a Life Sciences manufacturing and distribution facility in WuJiang, China. These facilities are expected to be operational in 2011 and 2012. Total capital expenditures for 2010 were $1.0 billion. Approximately $500 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment in 2010. Approximately $140 million in 2010 was invested in our Specialty Materials segment. We expect our 2011 capital spending to be about $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment. Corporate Outlook Corning expects significant sales growth in 2011, led by strong demand for our Corning Gorilla glass products. We believe worldwide demand for LCD glass in 2011 will increase from 3.15 billion square feet to approximately 3.6 to 3.8 billion square feet when compared to 2010, driven by continued strength in demand for LCD televisions, computer notebooks, and desktop monitors. Earnings will be negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the absence of the 2010 tax benefits resulting from our repatriation actions, increased income in higher tax rate jurisdictions and tax holiday expirations. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning will also be impacted by higher taxes in 2011. Cash flow from operations may decline as we expect lower dividends from equity affiliates. We will also use more cash for investing activities as we expand our capacity to meet growing demand. We may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses. We remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation, while preserving our financial stability, will enable our continued long term success. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions): % change 2010 2009 2008 10 vs. 09 09 vs. 08 Net sales $ 6,632 $ 5,395 $ 5,948 23 (9 ) Gross margin $ 3,049 $ 2,093 $ 2,738 46 (24 ) (gross margin %) 46 % 39 % 46 % Selling, general and administrative expense $ 1,015 $ 881 $ 901 15 (2 ) (as a % of net sales) 15 % 16 % 15 % Research, development and engineering expenses $ 603 $ 563 $ 627 7 (10 ) (as a % of net sales) 9 % 10 % 11 % Restructuring, impairment and other (credits) and charges $ (329 ) $ 228 $ 19 * * (as a % of net sales) (5 )% 4 % 0 % Asbestos litigation (credit) charge $ (49 ) $ 20 $ (340 ) * * (as a % of net sales) (1 )% 0 % (6 )% Equity in earnings of affiliated companies $ 1,958 $ 1,435 $ 1,358 36 6 (as a % of net sales) 30 % 27 % 23 % Income before income taxes $ 3,845 $ 1,934 $ 2,882 99 (33 ) (as a % of net sales) 58 % 36 % 48 % (Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (287 ) $ 74 $ 2,375 (488 ) (97 ) (as a % of net sales) (4 )% 1 % 40 % Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated $ 3,558 $ 2,008 $ 5,257 77 (62 ) (as a % of net sales) 54 % 37 % 88 % * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. Net Sales Net sales in 2010 increased 23% due to higher sales in all of our segments when compared to 2009, driven by volume growth in all of our segments and from the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. We saw demand increase for all of our LCD products, led by strong growth of LCD televisions outside of the United States. Sales in our Specialty Materials segment in 2010 increased 75% when compared to 2009, due to strong demand for Corning Gorilla glass products, our thin sheet glass designed to function as a protective cover glass on display devices. Sales were also strong in both our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments, up 38% and 39%, respectively. Net sales in 2009 decreased 9% due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to 2008, driven primarily by volume and price declines in the Display Technologies segment offset somewhat by $194 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. The largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first quarter of 2009 as LCD glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions. Over the remainder of 2009, we saw demand levels for LCD glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and, we believe, a corresponding expansion in the LCD industry supply chain as demand for LCD televisions improved. In the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales increased 41% when compared to 2008 and 4% when compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by increased net sales in the Display Technologies segment. For the full year of 2009, lower volume in the Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending for telecommunications networks contracted. 24 Table of Contents In 2010, net sales into international markets accounted for 74% of net sales. For 2009 and 2008, net sales into international markets accounted for 76% and 74%, respectively, of net sales. Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. Gross Margin For 2010, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales increased significantly when compared to 2009, due primarily to the impact of volume increases in the Display Technologies segment, offset somewhat by price declines. Improvements were also driven by strong sales in the Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, as well as cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiency improvements. For 2009, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales declined when compared to 2008, due primarily to the impact of price declines in the Display Technologies segment and reduced volume in the Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin of 27% in the first quarter of 2009 reflected the sharp decline in net sales as first quarter LCD glass demand continued to fall in response to worsening economic conditions. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin approximated 41% in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2009 and reflected improved demand in a number of our businesses. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2010 were up when compared to 2009, due primarily to higher compensation related costs and the costs of integrating our new businesses, offset by the impact of restructuring actions completed in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2010 were down slightly when compared to 2009, because the rate of increase in sales exceeded the rate of increase in spending for selling, general, and administrative costs. The slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2009 when compared to 2008, in dollars, were due primarily to the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts and restructuring actions in 2009, offset somewhat by an increase in performance based compensation costs. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses Research, development, and engineering expenses for 2010 increased by $40 million to $603 million in 2010 when compared to 2009, but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales. Cornings research, development and engineering expenses are currently focused on our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments. Excluding these segments, the largest driver of spending continues to be for adjacent products such as Corning Gorilla glass, and research for new business development. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. Research, development, and engineering expenses decreased by $64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008, but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales. Reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts. 25 Table of Contents Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and (Credits) Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2010, 2009 and 2008, which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A description of those charges and credits follows: 2010 Activity During 2009, we had two events which impacted production at several of our LCD glass manufacturing facilities. In August 2009, an earthquake halted production at one of our LCD glass manufacturing facilities in Japan and in October 2009, production at our facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $324 million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from these events, of which $259 million was received in cash through December 31, 2010. 2009 Activity In response to anticipated lower sales in 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million in 2009 primarily for a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce. The charges included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, and the impact of a $32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $150 million, with the majority of spending completed by 2010. We estimate annualized savings from these actions will be about $224 million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. 2008 Activity In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded $22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment. Asbestos Litigation In 2010, we recorded a decrease to our asbestos litigation liability of $49 million compared to a net increase of $20 million in 2009. The net decrease in 2010 was due primarily to a $54 million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the PCC asbestos claims. For the remainder of 2010, we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of $5 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability. In 2009, we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $20 million compared to a net decrease of $340 million in 2008. The net decrease in 2008 was due primarily to a $327 million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2008, as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in 2003. For the remainder of 2008, we recorded net credit adjustments of $13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability. Our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be $633 million at December 31, 2010, compared with an estimate of $682 million at December 31, 2009. The entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective, and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of Cornings investment in PCE (currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment). See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter. Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Samsung Corning Precision $ 1,473 $ 1,115 $ 927 Dow Corning 444 287 369 All other 41 33 62 Total equity earnings $ 1,958 $ 1,435 $ 1,358 26 Table of Contents The increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2010 reflected strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Corning Precision and at Dow Corning when compared to last year. Equity earnings at Samsung Corning Precision reflected the positive impact of increased volume, a non recurring tax benefit and movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by price declines, when compared to 2009. The increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2009 was driven by Samsung Corning Precision when compared to the same period last year. Equity earnings at Samsung Corning Precision reflected increased volume, manufacturing efficiency gains, and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to 2008. The change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the Display Technologies segment and in All Other. The increase in equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following items: An increase in sales of 18%, resulting from strength in Dow Cornings traditional silicone products and improved volume at Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation (Hemlock), Dow Cornings consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries; The positive impact of advanced energy manufacturing tax credits approved by the U.S. government for Dow Cornings manufacturing expansion projects that support the solar industry. Cornings share of these credits was $21 million; The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets. The impact to Corning was $26 million; and The absence of restructuring charges in the amount of $29 million recorded in 2009 for our share of costs associated with Dow Cornings global workforce reduction. The decline in equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2009 was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at Dow Corning, offset somewhat by the impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year. Sales at Dow Corning declined 7% in 2009 when compared to 2008 and included volume declines in Dow Cornings traditional silicone businesses that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at Hemlock. Sales of Dow Cornings traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in 2009. Sales at Hemlock increased in 2009, driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to 2008. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from Dow Corning. Sales at Dow Corning in 2011 are expected to increase when compared to 2010, driven by higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at Hemlock. In the first quarter of 2011, equity earnings from Dow Corning are expected to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net in Cornings consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision $ 265 $ 232 $ 184 Foreign currency transaction and hedge (losses) / gains (22 ) (54 ) (112 ) Loss on retirement of debt (30 ) Net realized losses of available for sale securities (2 ) (2 ) (53 ) Loss on sale of Steuben glass business (14 ) Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 (6 ) 1 Other, net (29 ) 1 (28 ) Total $ 184 $ 171 $ (22 ) Income Before Income Taxes In addition to the items identified under Gross margin, Restructuring, impairment and other (credits) and charges, Asbestos litigation (credit) charge, and Other income (expense), net, movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented. In 2010, Income before income taxes included $229 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009. In 2009, Income before income taxes included $414 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year. 27 Table of Contents (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes Our (provision) benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (287 ) $ 74 $ 2,375 Effective tax rate (7.5 )% 3.8 % 82.4 % The effective income tax rate for 2010 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions; The benefit of excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; and The impact of the reversal of the deferred tax assets associated with a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our OPEB liability. The effective income tax rate for 2009 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions; The benefit of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit for years 2005 2009; The benefit of recording additional deferred tax assets for a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our OPEB liability; and The impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets. The effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2008 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: The release of $2.5 billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets in future years, described below; The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions; and A $40 million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the Canadian Revenue Agency. As more fully described in Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances until the second quarter of 2008. At that time, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the U.S. As a result, we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance was needed. The evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective. Following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008: Positive pre tax income in the U.S. for the first half of 2008 and the preceding year; The impact of positive results in the Display Technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this segment; The number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards; and Increased confidence in our longer term forecasted income levels, which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses. 28 Table of Contents At June 30, 2008, the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment, but were less heavily weighted than our positive evidence: Uncertainty of future taxable earnings; Historical utilization of deferred tax assets caused largely by non recurring items; and Economic and consumer demand uncertainty. Deferred tax liabilities totaled $26 million at December 31, 2008, and therefore, were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. In 2008, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of the valuation allowances, and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S., was a reduction in our effective tax rate of 8.6 percentage points for 2008. Certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other federal and state tax credits, will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of December 31, 2010, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire. U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010. Of that amount, $4.9 billion of U.S. profits will be required over the next 15 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards. The remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period. The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $214 million and $245 million, respectively. We currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2010, taxes have not been provided on approximately $8.9 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2014 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 3.1, 7.3 and 5.3 percentage points for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters. Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated As a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated $ 3,558 $ 2,008 $ 5,257 Basic earnings per common share $ 2.28 $ 1.30 $ 3.37 Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.25 $ 1.28 $ 3.32 Shares used in computing per share amounts Basic earnings per common share 1,558 1,550 1,560 Diluted earnings per common share 1,581 1,568 1,584 29 Table of Contents OPERATING SEGMENTS Our reportable operating segments are as follows: Display Technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays. Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry. Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications. This reportable operating segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. Specialty Materials manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as All Other. This group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines. We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2009, we began providing U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) on U.S. earnings (losses) due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2008. As a result of the change in our tax position, we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in 2009 to reflect this difference. The impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant. Display Technologies (dollars in millions): % change 2010 2009 2008 10 vs. 09 09 vs. 08 Net sales $ 3,011 $ 2,426 $ 2,724 24 (11 ) Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 1,452 $ 1,102 $ 916 32 20 Net income $ 2,990 $ 1,992 $ 2,221 50 (10 ) 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in net sales in 2010 when compared to 2009 reflected an increase in volume of more than 25% (measured in square feet of glass sold) and the positive impact of $179 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by price declines of 8%. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. Volume gains in 2010 were led by strong growth in demand for LCD televisions outside of the United States, coupled with a replenishment of this industrys supply chain. Equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision in 2010 increased by 32% when compared to 2009 due to volume gains of almost 20%, improved manufacturing performance, and by the positive impact of $90 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by price declines of 7%. Equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar Japanese yen and U.S. dollar Korean won exchange rates. Equity earnings were also positively impacted by a $61 million credit for our share of a revised Samsung Corning Precision tax holiday calculation agreed to by the Korean National Tax service. 30 Table of Contents When compared to last year, the increase in net income in 2010 primarily reflects the impact of the volume increases described above at both our wholly owned business and Samsung Corning Precision and the impact of an insurance settlement for business interruption and property damage insurance claims, partially offset by price declines. The insurance settlement relates to two events in 2009 which impacted production at our LCD glass manufacturing facilities. In August 2009, an earthquake halted production at one of our LCD glass manufacturing facilities in Japan and in October 2009, production at our facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. We recorded a pre tax credit in 2010 in the amount of $324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims related to these two events. Results also improved due to the absence of $31 million of restructuring charges impacting 2009 net income. Net income included royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision that was higher in 2010 when compared to last year, reflecting the improvements in sales volume at Samsung Corning Precision. A number of Cornings patents and know how are licensed to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, generating royalty income. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions. Net income in 2010 includes the favorable impact of $182 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in net sales in 2009 reflected price declines of 19% and a decline in volume of 2% (measured in square feet of glass sold), offset somewhat by the positive impact of $228 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. When compared to 2008, the volume decline in 2009 occurred largely in the first quarter of 2009 and reflected a number of industry dynamics. Because Corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers, supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in Cornings volume. During the second half of 2008, the LCD market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined. We believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of 2009, followed by replenishment in the second quarter. Over the remainder of 2009, we saw demand levels for LCD glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels. In the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales increased 84% when compared to the same period in 2008 and 6% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. With increasing demand over the course of 2009, we strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of 2008. As described above, in 2009, an earthquake in Shizuoka, Japan halted production at the Companys LCD glass manufacturing facility and production at the Companys LCD glass manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. Incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support LCD glass shipments. We believe our market share was negatively impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust. The Company incurred approximately $30 million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs from these events. In 2009, equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision reflected the positive impact of $187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in volume of 35% offset somewhat by price declines of 20% when compared to the same period in 2008. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar Japanese yen and U.S. dollar Korean won exchange rates. Results of Samsung Corning Precision reflected improvements in the overall LCD glass market, which grew approximately 20% in 2009 when compared to 2008. The economic recession had a greater impact on our wholly owned business in Taiwan than on Samsung Corning Precision. Since Taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition, they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand. When compared to 2008, the decline in net income in 2009 was primarily due to the impact of volume and price declines, costs associated with the earthquake in Japan, and restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009. These items were offset somewhat by $342 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity earnings. Net income of this segment in 2009 included $31 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. Net income also includes royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision, which was higher in 2009 when compared to 2008 reflecting the improvements in sales volume at Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate royalty income. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about related party transactions. 31 Table of Contents Other Information The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan and Taiwan. For 2010 and 2009, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 72% and 62%, respectively, of total segment sales when combined. Our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues, our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2010 and 2009, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea accounted for approximately 93% of Samsung Corning Precision sales in each of those two years. Corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, capital spending in this segment was $497 million, $552 million, and $1.4 billion, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2011 to be approximately $1.2 to $1.5 billion. In 2005 and 2004, several of Cornings customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which Cornings Display Technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. We received our last deposit of $105 million in July 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we issued $83 million, $253 million, and $266 million, respectively, in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. In the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers deposits. Refer to Note 11 (Other Liabilities) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Outlook: We expect the overall LCD glass market in 2011 to be approximately 3.6 to 3.8 billion square feet. This is an increase over 2010, which was 3.15 billion square feet. Demand will be driven by continued growth of LCD televisions, particularly in emerging regions such as China. We expect industry glass supply and demand to be relatively in balance and quarterly sequential glass price declines to be moderate. We believe that the long term drivers of the LCD market will be LCD television growth, driven by increased demand in emerging regions and a faster replacement cycle, as well as continued growth in the personal computer market. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect volume at our wholly owned business and at Samsung Corning Precision to increase by the mid single digits when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect sequential price declines in the first quarter of 2011 to be more moderate than those in the fourth quarter of 2010. The end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending, among other things. We are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions, particularly the global economic recession, and world political tensions could have on consumer demand. While the industry has grown rapidly in recent years, economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, prices, or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. We may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. 32 Table of Contents Telecommunications (dollars in millions): % change 2010 2009 2008 10 vs. 09 09 vs. 08 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 878 $ 909 $ 920 (3 ) (1 ) Hardware and equipment 834 768 879 9 (13 ) Total net sales $ 1,712 $ 1,677 $ 1,799 2 (7 ) Net income $ 97 $ 19 $ 45 411 (58 ) 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales for the segment were up when compared to 2009. Higher sales of enterprise network products and optical fiber and cable in North America and Europe were offset somewhat by lower sales of fiber to the premises products and optical fiber and cable products in Asia, as well as the absence of sales from two businesses sold last year. Sales from the two businesses sold totaled $49 million in 2009. Net sales in 2010 were negatively impacted by $11 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, when compared to last year. The increase in net income in 2010 reflected the absence of restructuring charges from last year, volume strength in enterprise network products, and the impact of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction efforts. Net income of this segment in 2009 included $42 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce. Net income in 2010 includes the favorable impact of $10 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, when compared to last year. The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2010, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 15% of total segment net sales. In 2009, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 12% of total segment net sales. In 2008, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales, collectively accounted for 24%, of total segment sales when combined. 2009 vs. 2008 In 2009, net sales of this segment decreased when compared to the same period in 2008 and reflected declines across all of our businesses. When compared to 2008, lower volumes in both North America and Europe were offset somewhat by higher net sales for optical fiber and cable in China as the country continued to expand its telecommunications infrastructure. Volume in North America and Europe reflected the continuing impact of the economic recession. In addition, net sales of this segment were negatively impacted by $23 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. For 2009, the decline in net income reflected the volume impacts as described above and the impact of restructuring charges, offset somewhat by lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring actions when compared to 2008. Net income of this segment included the impact of $42 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan. Actions in this segment included workforce reductions, the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented. Outlook: We expect net sales of the Telecommunications segment to be up approximately 15% in 2011, driven by an increase in global demand for our fiber to the premises products and enterprise network products, as well as from the impact of a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect net sales of this segment to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. Changes in our customers expected deployment plans, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect sales levels. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. 33 Table of Contents Environmental Technologies (dollars in millions): % change 2010 2009 2008 10 vs. 09 09 vs. 08 Net sales: Automotive $ 462 $ 360 $ 458 28 (21 ) Diesel 354 230 253 54 (9 ) Total net sales $ 816 $ 590 $ 711 38 (17 ) Net income (loss) $ 42 $ (42 ) $ 33 * * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales for the Environmental Technologies segment in 2010 were up 38% when compared to the previous year and reflected higher volumes of both automotive and diesel products, offset somewhat by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. In 2009, automotive vehicle sales declined with the worldwide recession and production was significantly below vehicle sales volumes as manufacturers and dealers decreased inventories. In 2010, as automotive markets in the United States and Europe improved and China continued to expand, manufacturers and dealers increased inventories and production levels, resulting in a 25% increase in automotive production when compared to 2009. Diesel product sales increased 54% reflecting an improvement in the truck market in the United States and implementation of governmental regulations in Europe. Net sales of this segment in 2010 were negatively impacted by $11 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year. Net income in 2010 increased due to higher sales volumes and improvements in manufacturing performance, offset somewhat by higher freight costs, when compared to last year. Net income in 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges in comparison to the same period last year. In 2009, net loss of this segment included $28 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales last year. Net income in 2010 included the negative impact of $9 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same periods last year. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers. For 2010, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 86% of total segment sales. For 2009 and 2008, net sales to those same three customers accounted for 85% and 81%, respectively, of total segment sales. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers, our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products. 2009 vs. 2008 When compared to 2008, net sales for 2009 were negatively impacted by lower automotive production caused by the global recession and subsequent inventory reductions at automotive manufacturers and dealers. In the first quarter of 2009, U.S. automotive builds were at their lowest levels since Corning entered this business. In the first half of 2009, net sales of this segment declined 40% when compared to the first half of 2008. In the second half of 2009, year over year net sales were up 14% when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in China, Europe and the U.S. In addition, we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also caused increased demand. Diesel product sales in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession driven weak freight industry in the U.S. This was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of 2009 as engine manufacturers prepared for stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards in 2010. Net sales in 2009 were negatively impacted by $9 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period in 2008. Net loss in 2009 reflected lower sales and manufacturing volume of both automotive and diesel products, offset somewhat by lower operating expenses, when compared to net income 2008. In addition, net loss of this segment in 2009 included the impact of restructuring charges. Restructuring charges for this segment totaled $28 million for the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to lower sales in 2009. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this operating segment. 34 Table of Contents Outlook: We expect net sales of this segment to improve by approximately 10% in 2011 due to strong growth in demand for diesel products driven by recovery in the United States freight market and related truck production, full implementation of governmental regulations on light duty diesel vehicles in Europe and the start of non road regulation implementation in the United States. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect net sales of this segment to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. Specialty Materials (dollars in millions): % change 2010 2009 2008 10 vs. 09 09 vs. 08 Net sales $ 578 $ 331 $ 372 75 (11 ) Net loss $ (27 ) $ (54 ) $ (7 ) * * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2010 vs. 2009 The Specialty Materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Consequently, this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components, semiconductor optics components, aerospace and defense, astronomy, ophthalmic products, telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices and televisions. Net sales increased in 2010 due to higher sales of Corning Gorilla glass and an increase in sales of display components and semiconductor optics and components when compared to last year. Sales of Corning Gorilla glass have continued to increase as the Company moves to capitalize on market opportunities for this product. The lower net loss in 2010 was driven by higher sales of our Corning Gorilla glass products and the absence of restructuring charges, offset somewhat by the costs associated with adding capacity. The net loss in 2009 included $17 million of restructuring charges for the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce. In 2010, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment. For 2010, three customers of the Specialty Materials segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 43% of total segment sales. 2009 vs. 2008 Net sales decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales of semiconductor optics and components as a result of the significant market downturn, offset somewhat by an increase in sales of Corning Gorilla glass. The net loss for 2009 resulted from the decline in net sales along with manufacturing development costs for Corning Gorilla glass when compared to 2008. The net loss in 2009 also included $17 million of restructuring charges for the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009, and costs associated with closing one of this segments manufacturing facilities. In 2009, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the profitability of this segment. Outlook: For 2011, we expect sales of this segment to increase significantly driven by increased sales of Corning Gorilla glass when compared to 2010. We expect a modest increase in sales of semiconductor products as the semiconductor industry begins to improve. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect net sales to be up 20% to 25%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to strong demand for Corning Gorilla glass. 35 Table of Contents Life Sciences (dollars in millions): 2010 2009 2008 % change 10 vs. 09 09 vs. 08 Net sales $ 508 $ 366 $ 326 39 12 Net income $ 60 $ 39 $ 53 54 (26 ) 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in net sales in 2010 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Axygen, which was completed in the third quarter of 2009, and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. These acquisitions supported the Companys strategy to expand Cornings portfolio of life sciences products and enhance global customer access in this business, and accounted for $117 million of the increase in sales in 2010 when compared to 2009. The segments existing products lines also showed strong sales growth in 2010, improving $25 million when compared to 2009. The improvement in net income in 2010 reflected the sales increases as described above, offset somewhat by higher cost of materials and expenses associated with the integration of Axygen. Net income for 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges when compared to last year. For 2009, net income of this segment included $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net sales or net income for this operating segment. 2009 vs. 2008 For 2009, the increase in net sales of this segment reflected sales from the acquisition of Axygen, which was completed in the third quarter of 2009, offset somewhat by volume declines in the Companys existing life sciences products. Sales of Axygen products were approximately $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009, the decline in net income resulted primarily from acquisition related costs and the impact of $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan, when compared to the 2008. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this operating segment in 2009. For 2010, two customers in the Life Sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 37% of total segment sales. For 2009, two customers in the Life Sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45% of total segment sales. For 2008, one customer accounted for 45%, of total segment sales. Outlook: Sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2011 are expected to be up approximately 15% when compared to 2010, primarily due to the impact of the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect net sales to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.

This segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD glass businesses, Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates, which manufacture smooth cooktop glass/ceramic products, and Corsam Technologies LLC (Corsam), an equity affiliate established between Corning and Samsung Corning Precision to provide glass technology research. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) for additional information about Samsung Corning Precision and related party transactions. 36 Table of Contents The decrease in the net loss in this segment for 2010 is primarily due to improved equity earnings from corporate investments and lower operating costs, offset by the costs of exiting our synthetic green laser program and the start up costs for new business development projects. 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in this segments net loss for 2009 resulted primarily from lower operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2009, cost reduction efforts, and the impact of the change in the Companys tax position. Net loss of this segment for 2009 included $4 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing and Capital Structure The following items impacted Cornings financing and capital structure during 2010 and 2009: In the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the following debt related transactions: We borrowed $1.1 billion under our revolving credit facility. Corning used the funds in connection with our previously announced plan to repatriate approximately $1.1 billion to the United States. The borrowing was repaid in full on December 16, 2010. We exercised our option to repurchase $100 million of 6.05% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2015 at par. The net carrying amount of the debt repurchased was $100 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received a special dividend of almost $900 million, net of applicable withholding taxes, from our equity affiliate Samsung Corning Precision. In the third quarter of 2010, we completed the following debt related transactions: We issued $400 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2040 and $300 million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2020. The net proceeds of $689 million from the offering were used to fund the repurchase of debt securities and for general corporate purposes. We repurchased $126 million of our 6.2% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and $100 million of our 5.9% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and recognized a pre tax loss of $30 million upon the early redemption of these notes. In the first quarter of 2010, we repaid $58 million of debt, which included the redemption of $48 million principal amount of our 6.25% notes due February 18, 2010. In the second quarter of 2009, we issued $250 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes and $100 million of 7% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 15, 2019, and May 15, 2024, respectively. The net proceeds of $346 million were used for general corporate purposes. In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded the impact of a capital lease obligation for a manufacturing facility associated with our Display Technologies segment. In December 2010, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to provide a $1.0 billion committed, unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through December 2015. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $1.0 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.9 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital spending in 2010 and 2009 was driven primarily by projects to expand our LCD glass capacity in our Display Technologies segment. Capital spending in 2008 primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2011 capital spending program is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion. Approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment. In the third quarter of 2010, we announced multi year investment plans for additional manufacturing capacity that will benefit a number of our segments. The plans include $800 million for spending associated with a new LCD glass substrate facility in the Peoples Republic of China to meet expected growing demand for our LCD glass. Spending for this facility began in September of this year and we expect production to begin in 2012. Additional investments will include construction projects in other regions to expand capacity for Eagle XG&reg; LCD glass substrates and will benefit our Specialty Materials segment by providing capacity for increased demand of Corning Gorilla glass. The plans also include spending in the Environmental Technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in Shanghai, China and Kaiserslautern, Germany. Additionally, the plans establish a Life Sciences manufacturing and distribution facility in WuJiang, China. These facilities are expected to be operational in 2011 and 2012. 37 Table of Contents Cash Flows Summary of cash flow data (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,835 $ 2,077 $ 2,128 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,769 ) $ (1,370 ) $ (1,699 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (2 ) $ (15 ) $ (798 ) 2010 vs. 2009 Operating cash flow increased significantly in 2010 when compared to 2009, driven largely by a special dividend of almost $900 million received from Samsung Corning Precision. We also recorded a credit in the amount of $324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims, and received cash totaling $259 million from our panel of insurance carriers representing a partial payment of this settlement. Additionally, we issued less credits against customer deposits in 2010 when compared to 2009. These positive events were partially offset by higher contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in 2010 and the decrease in cash from changes in working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in short term investment purchases and higher capital expenditures, offset by lower costs for the acquisition of businesses. Net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2010 primarily due to the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, offset somewhat by the net cash impact of financing activities. 2009 vs. 2008 Although 2009 net income decreased significantly from 2008, operating cash flow declined only slightly. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from two non recurring, non cash items: the release of $2.5 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a $340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities. When compared to 2008, operating cash flow in 2009 reflected higher pension contributions and restructuring payments, offset somewhat by an increase in cash from changes in working capital and higher dividends from equity affiliates. Net cash used in investing activities was lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 due to lower capital expenditures in our Display Technologies segment, offset partially by the acquisition of Axygen. Net cash used in financing activities also decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due to the issuance of long term debt and the discontinuation of common stock repurchases. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2010, this plan accounted for 81% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91% of the related plans assets. We have historically contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2012. In 2010, we made voluntary cash contributions of $350 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $5 million to our international pension plans. In 2009, we made voluntary cash contributions of $75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $5 million to our international pension plans. In 2008, we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by $33 million. In 2009 and 2010, actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable driven by the performance of public equity markets, commodities and long duration fixed income securities. Although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2011, we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to $30 million to our international pension plans in 2011. We do not plan to contribute to our domestic pension plan in 2011, which is sufficiently funded. Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 38 Table of Contents Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. Between 2004 and 2007, we received a total of $937 million for customer deposit agreements. We received our last deposit of $105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we issued credit memoranda which totaled $83 million, $253 million, and $266 million, respectively. These credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. Customer deposit liabilities were $27 million and $104 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2011, we expect to issue approximately $27 million in credit memoranda. Restructuring In 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million associated with a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. The charge included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, asset write offs, and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $150 million primarily related to termination benefits. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we made payments of $66 million, $89 million, and $17 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other (Credits) and Charges) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Key Balance Sheet Data Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Working capital $ 6,873 $ 3,982 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 523 $ 399 Current ratio 4.5:1 3.6:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 973 $ 753 Days sales outstanding 50 44 Inventories $ 738 $ 579 Inventory turns 5.4 5.1 Days payable outstanding (1) 42 36 Long term debt $ 2,262 $ 1,930 Total debt to total capital 11 % 11 % (1) Includes trade payables only. Credit Ratings As of February 10, 2011, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Rating long term debt Outlook last update Fitch BBB+ Positive May 17, 2010 Standard & Poors BBB+ Stable July 2, 2007 Moodys Baa1 Stable February 19, 2010 39 Table of Contents Management Assessment of Liquidity We ended the fourth quarter of 2010 with over $6.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The Company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. At December 31, 2010 slightly less than half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the U.S. Almost all of the amounts held outside of the U.S. are available for repatriation, subject to relevant tax consequences. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we repatriated to the U.S. approximately $1.1 billion of current year earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. In conjunction with the repatriation of cash to the U.S., we temporarily borrowed against our unsecured committed revolving line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2010. All amounts borrowed were repaid on December 16, 2010. We expect that we will meet additional U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. Realized gains and losses on available for sale securities were not significant in 2010 or 2009. In 2008, we recorded $53 million of net realized losses on short term investments which represented less than 6% of our total holdings of available for sale securities at that time. Refer to Note 3 (Available for Sale Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2008, we repurchased 29.5 million shares of common stock for $625 million as part of repurchase programs announced in July 2007 and July 2008. There were no repurchases in 2009 or 2010. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues. Our major source of funding for 2011 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, and dividend payments. Corning also has access to a $1.0 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit through December 2015. The credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. Our leverage ratio using this measure was 11% at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The required interest coverage ratio, which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility, compared to interest expense, is a ratio of at least 3.5 times. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 40.2 times and 30.3 times, respectively. Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby a default on one debt obligation of the Company in excess of a specified amount, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all such provisions. Other than the 2011 capital spending plan, management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: Guarantee contracts; and Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. 40 Table of Contents At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities. The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. Corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities. None of these entities is considered to be significant to Cornings consolidated statements of position. Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity. Contractual Obligations The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions): Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Total Less than1 year 1 to 2years 2 to 3years 3 to 4years 5 years andthereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 64 $ 35 $ 5 $ 3 $ 21 Credit facilities for equity companies 100 25 25 25 $ 25 Stand by letters of credit (1) 58 58 Loan guarantees 8 8 Subtotal of commitment expirations per period $ 230 $ 118 $ 30 $ 28 $ 25 $ 29 Purchase obligations $ 408 $ 238 $ 144 $ 17 $ 6 $ 3 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 382 382 Total debt (3) 2,021 25 25 126 124 1,721 Minimum rental commitments 223 46 40 33 27 77 Capital leases (3)(4) 421 46 15 14 13 333 Interest on long term debt (5) 1,938 124 123 123 112 1,456 Uncertain tax positions (6) 7 3 4 Subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period 5,400 864 351 313 282 3,590 Total commitments and contingencies $ 5,630 $ 982 $ 381 $ 341 $ 307 $ 3,619 (1) At December 31, 2010, $42 million of the $58 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Capital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with our capital expansion activities. (3) At December 31, 2010, $2.3 billion was included on our balance sheet. Total debt above is stated at maturity value. (4) At December 31, 2010, $167 million of the $421 million represents imputed interest. (5) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. (6) At December 31, 2010, $13 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $6 million of that amount will become payable. 41 Table of Contents We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy related take or pay contracts. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. ENVIRONMENT Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Corning had accrued approximately $30 million (undiscounted) and $26 million (undiscounted), respectively, for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Companys liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, follow. Impairment of assets held for use We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets. This review considers all of the Companys precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include: A significant decrease in the market price of an asset; A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset; A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. 42 Table of Contents For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the majority of our reporting segments, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For long lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. The fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include: market size and growth, market share, projected selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our long lived assets were not recoverable. At December 31, 2010, the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by $415 million. At December 31, 2009, the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by $193 million. Currently these precious metal assets, primarily in the Display Technologies segment, are recoverable as part of their asset groupings. There is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products of our Display Technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability. Variable Interest Entities The Company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities. These investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether Corning is a primary beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests. A variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. A company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a VIE is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE and if a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk, the evaluation of contractual arrangements, and assessments about forecasted information. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, changes in these judgments or estimates could affect Cornings results. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted required changes to consolidation guidance for variable interest entities that require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. In addition, the required changes provide guidance on shared power and joint venture relationships, remove the scope exemption for qualified special purpose entities, revise the definition of a variable interest entity, and require additional disclosures. The adoption of this standard was not material to Cornings consolidated results of operations or financial condition. For variable interest entities, we routinely assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities. The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning. None of these entities is considered significant to Cornings consolidated financial statements. 43 Table of Contents Impairment of goodwill We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. As disclosed in Note 10 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Cornings goodwill relates primarily to the Telecommunications, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences operating segments. Our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process. This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows. Our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. Periodically, the detailed determination of fair value is carried forward from one year to the next if certain criteria are met. In 2010, an assessment of all of the reporting units was performed and it was determined the criteria to carry forward the detailed determination of fair value were met, as follows: Assets and liabilities that make up the Telecommunications, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences reporting units did not change significantly from the fourth quarter of 2009; The fair value determination completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 for all reporting units resulted in amounts that exceeded the carrying amount by a substantial margin; and The likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the carrying amount of the reporting units is remote based on analysis of events that have occurred since the fair value assessment was completed in 2009. Telecommunications Goodwill for the Telecommunications segment is tested at the operating segment level. We have aggregated the Telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment reviews based on the manner in which we operate our businesses; the vertically integrated nature of these operations; shared assets, operating and finance resources, and management; the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment; and the shared support and benefit from common research and development activity. Results for the Telecommunications segment in 2010 were up when compared with 2009. We anticipate higher sales in 2011 as demand increases for fiber to the home products and outside plant cable products. In 2010, the results of our review of the Telecommunications segment was in line with our expectations for the long term growth of this business as compared with our 2009 evaluation, which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009. A range of 7% to 11% would not have changed our conclusion. Specialty Materials Goodwill for the Specialty Materials segment is tested at the component level, which is one level below an operating segment, because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment. Although the Specialty Materials segment had small reported losses in 2010 and 2009, we anticipate growth in new products will improve longer term profitability. In 2010, the results of our review of the Specialty Materials segment was in line with our expectations for the long term growth of this business as compared with our 2009 evaluation, which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009. A range of 7% to 11% would not have changed our conclusion. Life Sciences Goodwill for the Life Sciences segment is tested at the operating segment level. We have aggregated the Life Sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses. Results in the Life Sciences segment in 2010 were up when compared to 2009, reflecting the positive impact of Axygen, an acquisition which was completed in the third quarter of 2009. In 2010, the results of our review of the Life Sciences segment was in line with our expectations for the long term growth of this business as compared with our 2009 evaluation, which indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceed its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 8% was used in 2009. A range of 6% to 10% would not have changed our conclusion. 44 Table of Contents Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions We are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment. We are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. Income taxes We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. In the second quarter of 2008, we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets. A key trend included in our projections was the rate of penetration of LCD televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household, faster LCD television replacement rates, the continued decline of cathode ray tube products, and growth in emerging markets such as China. Another key trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth. In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we released an additional $70 million, and $45 million, respectively, of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of U.S. taxable income. Significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included: the long term stabilization of U.S. income from forecasted royalty income in our Display Technologies operating segment, the long term growth of our diesel business, and the future success of new products. Equity method investments At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $4.4 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 95% of the balance. We review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired. When such indicators are present, we then perform an in depth review for impairment. An impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable. Fair value measures As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Companys own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement. In addition, observable market data must be used when available. Cornings major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments, pension asset investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions. 45 Table of Contents Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. In arriving at the fair value of Cornings derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. Amounts related to credit risk are not material. Probability of litigation outcomes We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case specific issues. See Part II Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives. The proposed asbestos resolution (Amended PCC Plan) is subject to a number of contingencies. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and faces objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is subject to appeal. For these and other reasons, Cornings liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the cost of resolving the non PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. Other possible liabilities We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2010, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2.7 billion. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Change in assumption Effect on 2011pre tax pensionexpense Effect onDecember 31, 2010PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$5 million +$68 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $5 million $66 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$6 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets $6 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2010, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $94 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $91 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. 46 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Change in assumption Effect on 2011pre tax OPEBexpense Effect onDecember 31, 2010APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 1 million +$ 26 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ 1 million $ 25 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Forms 10 Q, Forms 8 K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, forecasts, and similar expressions are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: global business, financial, economic and political conditions; tariffs and import duties; currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, Euro, and Korean won; product demand and industry capacity; competitive products and pricing; availability and costs of critical components and materials; new product development and commercialization; order activity and demand from major customers; fluctuations in capital spending by customers; possible disruption in commercial activities due to terrorist activity, armed conflict, political or financial instability, natural disasters, or major health concerns; unanticipated disruption to equipment, facilities, or operations; facility expansions and new plant start up costs; effect of regulatory and legal developments; ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand; credit rating and ability to obtain financing and capital on commercially reasonable terms; adequacy and availability of insurance; financial risk management; acquisition and divestiture activities; rate of technology change; level of excess or obsolete inventory; ability to enforce patents; adverse litigation; product and components performance issues; retention of key personnel; stock price fluctuations; trends for the continued growth of the Companys businesses; the ability of research and development projects to produce revenues in future periods; a downturn in demand or decline in growth rates for LCD glass substrates; customer ability, most notably in the Display Technologies segment, to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund their manufacturing expansions and ongoing operations; loss of significant customers; fluctuations in supply chain inventory levels; equity company activities, principally at Dow Corning Corporation and Samsung Corning Precision; changes in tax laws and regulations; changes in accounting rules and standards; the potential impact of legislation, government regulations, and other government action and investigations; temporary idling of capacity; the ability to implement productivity, consolidation and cost reduction efforts, and to realize anticipated benefits; restructuring actions and charges; and other risks detailed in Cornings SEC filings. 48 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects: Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. We have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the Japanese yen, euro, New Taiwan dollar and Korean won. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in Other Income (Expense), Net in the consolidated statements of income. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments were $2.0 billion and $1.4 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively, with foreign based affiliates comprising over 77% of this amount in 2010. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision totaled $1.5 billion for 2010 and $1.1 billion for 2009. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2010, we had open forward contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2010. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $360 million compared to $278 million at December 31, 2009. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $272 million compared to $131 million at December 31, 2009. Specific to the euro, a 10% adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $83 million compared to $107 million at December 31, 2009. As we derive approximately 74% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and euro. Our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2011 remain constant at January 2011 levels. As an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results, we compare 2010 actual sales in yen and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10% change in the currency exchange rate. A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately $308 million. A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately $56 million. Using 2010 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as a percentage of net sales of 54%, we can estimate that a plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of approximately $170 million. A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of approximately $30 million. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments. 49 Table of Contents
