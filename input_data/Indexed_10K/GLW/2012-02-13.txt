Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. This discussion includes the following sections: Overview Results of Operations Reportable Segments Liquidity and Capital Resources Environment Critical Accounting Estimates New Accounting Standards Forward Looking Statements OVERVIEW Although Cornings net income declined in 2011 when compared to 2010, the majority of our segments experienced healthy sales growth, despite the challenging 2011 economic environment. The largest driver of Cornings sales increase was the robust retail demand for portable display devices that utilize our Corning Gorilla Glass. Our Telecommunications segment also experienced significant sales growth in 2011 due to strong fiber to the premises, enterprise network products, and optical fiber and cable sales. In addition, sales increased 22% in 2011 in our Environmental Technologies segment, reflecting increased demand worldwide for automotive and diesel products. Sales in the Life Sciences segment were higher primarily due to an increase in demand for the segments legacy products, combined with the impact of a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales in our Display Technologies segment were only slightly higher in 2011 when compared to the prior year, reflecting volume growth and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by significantly lower prices. Results in this segment reflect the excess glass capacity in the market, driven by lower than anticipated worldwide glass volume growth in 2011. Corning is addressing the current imbalance between glass supply and demand by reducing worldwide glass capacity in our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments by approximately 25%, impacting LCD glass capacity as well as Corning Gorilla Glass capacity. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated net income of $2.8 billion or $1.77 per share compared to net income of $3.6 billion or $2.25 per share for 2010. When compared to last year, the decrease in net income was due largely to the following items: Lower net income in the Display Technologies segment due to a significant decrease in equity earnings from our equity affiliate Samsung Corning Precision, reflecting higher taxes, lower volume and substantial price declines, combined with a decrease in net income in our wholly owned business, driven by price declines; A decrease in equity earnings from our equity affiliate Dow Corning, primarily due to significantly higher raw materials costs, the absence of non recurring favorable tax items recorded in 2010 and a sales shift from higher priced, higher margin silicones to lower priced, lower margin silicones. The decrease in equity earnings was offset somewhat by an $89 million gain associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by Hemlock Semiconductor Group against one of its customers relating to enforcement of long term supply agreements. Hemlock Semiconductor Group is Dow Cornings consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries; The absence of the benefit of the settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims in 2010 impacting our Display Technologies segment in the amount of $324 million (pre tax); A $130 million impairment charge (pretax) impacting our Specialty Materials segment related to certain assets located in Japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass; and An increase in our effective tax rate due to the following: The absence of the favorable tax impact from the decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in 2010 in the amount of $265 million; and The expiration of tax holidays in Taiwan. The decrease in net income in 2011 was offset somewhat from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of $219 million, and higher net income in our Telecommunications and Environmental Technologies segments. 24 Corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our independence. This strategy has served us well. Our key priorities for 2011 were similar to those in prior years: protect our financial health and invest in the future. During 2011, we made the following progress on these priorities: Financial Health Our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities. Significant items in 2011 included the following: Our debt to capital ratio at December 31, 2011 was 10%, slightly lower than our debt to capital ratio of 11% at December 31, 2010. Operating cash flow for the year was $3.2 billion. We ended the year with over $5.8 billion of cash and short term investments. Cornings Board of Directors declared a 50% increase in the companys quarterly common stock dividend. We repurchased 55 million shares of common stock for $780 million as part of a repurchase program announced in the fourth quarter. These actions reflect our significant cash balance and the belief that we will continue to achieve strong cash flows in the future. Investing in our future We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating keystone components that enable high technology systems. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering to drive innovation. We continue to work on new products, including glass substrates for high performance displays, OLED and LCD applications, diesel filters and substrates, and the optical fiber, cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises, and next generation data centers. In addition, in 2011, we increased our focused on wireless solutions for diverse venue applications such as Distributed Antenna Systems, fiber to the cell and antennas. We have increased our research, development and engineering spending to support the advancement of new product attributes for our Corning Gorilla Glass suite of products. We will continue to focus on adjacent glass opportunities, including products such as glass substrates for thin film photovoltaics in solar applications, which leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes. Our research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $68 million in 2011 when compared to 2010, but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales. We believe our spending levels are appropriate to support our technology and innovation strategies. Capital spending increased significantly in 2011 when compared to 2010, largely as a result of several multi year investment plans announced in 2010 that will increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments. Specifically, the increase in spending in 2011 was driven by construction costs for an LCD glass substrate facility in China for our Display Technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for Specialty Materials Corning Gorilla Glass in Japan. Capital expenditures in 2011 also include spending in the Environmental Technologies segment to expand its existing automotive substrate facilities in Shanghai, China and Kaiserslautern, Germany, and in the Life Sciences segment to establish a manufacturing and distribution facility in WuJiang, China. Total capital expenditures for 2011 were $2.4 billion. In 2011, approximately $1.3 billion was invested in our Display Technologies segment and approximately $348 million was invested in our Specialty Materials segment. We expect our 2012 capital spending to be about $1.8 billion. Approximately $800 million will be allocated to our Display Technologies segment, of which approximately $400 million will be related to 2011 capital projects. 25 Corporate Outlook Corning expects moderate sales growth in 2012, led by an increase in demand in our Telecommunications and Environmental Technologies segments. We believe worldwide demand for LCD glass in 2012 will increase from 3.2 billion square feet to approximately 3.6 billion square feet when compared to 2011, driven by the combination of an increase in retail sales of LCD televisions and the demand for larger television screen sizes, coupled with growth in the personal computer market. We expect cumulative double digit price declines in our Display segment over the two quarter period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are hopeful that sequential quarterly price declines in 2012 will be moderate. Net income will be negatively impacted by lower equity earnings from our equity affiliate Dow Corning, driven by lower demand and price declines in both silicone products and at Hemlock Semiconductor Group, Dow Cornings consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries. We may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses. We remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation, while preserving our financial stability, will enable our continued long term success.

Sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by 86%, due to the strong demand for Corning Gorilla Glass that is used as cover glass in portable handheld display devices, tablets and notebook computers. Telecommunications segment sales increased due to strength across all of their product lines, most significantly in optical fiber and cable and fiber to the premises products. Sales in the Environmental Technologies segment were higher, driven by higher demand for our diesel products. Additionally, the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates impacted sales in the amount of $345 million. Net sales in 2010 increased 23% due to higher sales in all of our segments when compared to 2009, driven by volume growth in all of our segments and from the net positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. We saw demand increase for all of our LCD products, led by strong growth of LCD televisions outside of the United States. Sales in our Specialty Materials segment in 2010 increased 75% when compared to 2009, due to strong demand for Corning Gorilla Glass products. Sales were also strong in both our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments, up 38% and 39%, respectively. In 2011, net sales into international markets accounted for 78% of net sales. For 2010 and 2009, net sales into international markets accounted for 74% and 76%, respectively, of net sales. Cost of Sales The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead. Gross Margin For 2011, gross margin dollars increased when compared to 2010, but declined slightly as a percentage of sales. Improvements in gross margin were driven by the impact of strong sales in the Specialty Materials segment, along with volume increases and manufacturing efficiency gains in the Environmental Technologies segment. Offsetting these gains was the impact of significant price declines in our Display Technologies segment. For 2010, gross margin dollars and as a percentage of net sales increased significantly when compared to 2009, due primarily to the impact of volume increases in the Display Technologies segment, offset somewhat by price declines. Improvements were also driven by strong sales in the Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, as well as cost reduction efforts and manufacturing efficiency improvements. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2011 increased slightly when compared to 2010, due primarily to an increase in salaries, partially as a result of three small acquisitions completed within the past 15 months, offset by an adjustment to performance based compensation costs and a credit of $27 million resulting from a reduction in a contingent liability associated with an acquisition recorded in the first quarter of 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2011 were down considerably when compared to 2010, because the rate of increase in sales exceeded the rate of increase in spending for selling, general, and administrative costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2010 were up when compared to 2009, due primarily to higher compensation related costs and the costs of integrating new businesses, offset by the impact of restructuring actions completed in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2010 were down slightly when compared to 2009, because the rate of increase in sales exceeded the rate of increase in spending for selling, general, and administrative costs. The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities. 27 Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses for 2011 increased by $68 million to $671 million in 2011 when compared to 2010, but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales. Cornings research, development and engineering expenses are currently focused on our Specialty Materials and Telecommunications segments as we strive to capitalize on growth opportunities in those segments. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies. Research, development and engineering expenses increased by $40 million in 2010 when compared to 2009, but declined slightly as a percentage of net sales. Increased spending in 2010 was driven primarily by the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments. Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and Credits Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2011, 2010 and 2009, which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A description of those charges and credits follows: 2011 Activity In the fourth quarter of 2011, Corning recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $130 million related to certain assets located in Japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass. Large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless (bezel less) LCD displays. The large cover glass impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment. This asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process. Additional information on the asset impairment is found in Note 9 (Property, Net of Accumulated Depreciation) and Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2010 Activity In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $324 million in other credits as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims resulting from two events which impacted production at several of our LCD glass manufacturing facilities. In August 2009, an earthquake halted production at one of our LCD glass manufacturing facilities in Japan and in October 2009, production at our facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. 2009 Activity In response to anticipated lower sales in 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million primarily for a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce. The charges included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, and the impact of a $32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions were approximately $150 million, with the majority of spending for employee related costs completed by 2010 and payments for exit activities substantially completed by the end of 2011. Annualized savings from these actions are about $224 million and are reflected largely in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Asbestos Litigation In 2011, we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $24 million compared to a net decrease in 2010 of $49 million. The net decrease in 2010 was due primarily to a $54 million decrease to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as a result of the change in terms of the proposed settlement of the PCC asbestos claims. For the remainder of 2010, we recorded net credit adjustments to our asbestos litigation liability of $5 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability. In 2009, we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $20 million. Our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be $657 million at December 31, 2011, compared with an estimate of $633 million at December 31, 2010. The entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the proposed Amended PCC Plan is ultimately effective, and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of Cornings investment in PCE (currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment). 28 See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter. Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Samsung Corning Precision $ 1,031 $ 1,473 $ 1,115 Dow Corning 404 444 287 All other 36 41 33 Total equity earnings $ 1,471 $ 1,958 $ 1,435 Equity earnings of affiliated companies decreased in 2011, reflecting lower earnings performance at both Samsung Corning Precision and at Dow Corning, when compared to last year. The change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the Display Technologies segment and in All Other. Equity earnings from Dow Corning were lower in 2011 when compared to 2010. The decline in equity earnings was largely due to the following items: An increase in raw material costs of slightly above $100 million; A sales shift from higher priced, higher margin silicones to lower priced, lower margin silicones; and A decrease in advanced energy manufacturing tax credits. The decrease in equity earnings from Dow Corning was partially offset by a gain in the amount of $89 million associated with the resolution of a contract dispute by Dow Cornings consolidated subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor Group (Hemlock), a producer of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar industries, against one of its customers relating to enforcement of long term supply agreements. In the second half of 2011, Dow Corning began experiencing unfavorable industry conditions at Hemlock. Declines in governmental subsidies in the solar panel industry, especially in Europe, and over capacity at all levels of the solar supply chain led to significant declines in polycrystalline spot prices. The decline in spot prices was large enough to potentially induce Hemlock customers to default on their long term contracts. In response, Hemlock modified a number of sales agreements to provide temporary pricing relief while preserving the long term favorable relationships with its customers. In addition, Hemlock decided to delay certain plant expansion activities until market conditions for polycrystalline silicon have improved. Prices for polycrystalline silicon are expected to remain at these substantially lower levels throughout 2012, negatively impacting profitability at Hemlock and resulting in lower equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2012 when compared to 2011. The increase in equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily due to the following items: An increase in sales of 18%, resulting from strength in Dow Cornings traditional silicone products and improved volume at Hemlock; The positive impact of advanced energy manufacturing tax credits approved by the U.S. government for Dow Cornings manufacturing expansion projects that support the solar industry. Cornings share of these credits was $21 million; The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets. The impact to Corning was $26 million; and The absence of restructuring charges in the amount of $29 million recorded in 2009 for our share of costs associated with Dow Cornings global workforce reduction. 29 Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net in Cornings consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision $ 219 $ 265 $ 232 Foreign currency transaction and hedge losses, net (43 ) (22 ) (54 ) Loss on retirement of debt (30 ) Net realized losses of available for sale securities (2 ) (2 ) Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 3 2 (6 ) Other, net (61 ) (29 ) 1 Total $ 118 $ 184 $ 171 Income Before Income Taxes In addition to the items identified under Gross margin, Restructuring, impairment and other charges (credits), Asbestos litigation charge (credit), and Other income, net, movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented. In 2011, Income before income taxes included $256 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010. In 2010, Income before income taxes included $229 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Our provision (benefit) for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 408 $ 287 $ (74 ) Effective tax rate 12.7 % 7.5 % (3.8 )% The effective income tax rate for 2011 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions; and A $41 million tax benefit from amending our 2006 U.S. Federal return to claim foreign tax credits. The effective income tax rate for 2010 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions; The benefit of excess foreign tax credits from repatriation of current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; and The impact of the reversal of the deferred tax assets associated with a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our other postretirement benefits liability. The effective income tax rate (benefit) for 2009 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items: Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies; The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions; The benefit of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit for years 2005 2009; The benefit of recording additional deferred tax assets for a tax exempt subsidy attributable to our OPEB liability; and The impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets. 30 Corning has valuation allowances on certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other foreign net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire. U.S. profits of approximately $7.8 billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011. Of that amount, $4.2 billion of U.S. profits will be required over the next 14 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards. The remaining deferred tax assets will be realized as the underlying temporary differences reverse over an extended period. The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $219 million and $214 million, respectively. We currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2011, taxes have not been provided on approximately $10.8 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries in China and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2015 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 2.0, 3.1 and 7.3 percentage points for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters. Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated As a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net income attributable to Corning Incorporated $ 2,805 $ 3,558 $ 2,008 Basic earnings per common share $ 1.80 $ 2.28 $ 1.30 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.77 $ 2.25 $ 1.28 Shares used in computing per share amounts Basic earnings per common share 1,562 1,558 1,550 Diluted earnings per common share 1,583 1,581 1,568 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Our reportable segments are as follows: Display Technologies manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays. Telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry. Environmental Technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications. This reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. Specialty Materials manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Life Sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications. All other reportable segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as All Other. This group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines. 31 We prepared the financial results for our segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segments net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2009, we began providing U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) on U.S. earnings (losses) due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2008. As a result of the change in our tax position, we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our reportable segments in 2009 to reflect this difference. The impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant. Display Technologies (dollars in millions): % change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Net sales $ 3,145 $ 3,011 $ 2,426 4 24 Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 1,027 $ 1,452 $ 1,102 (29 ) 32 Net income $ 2,349 $ 2,993 $ 1,992 (22 ) 50 2011 vs. 2010 The end market for LCD televisions was up slightly, with unit growth rates remaining consistent with or exceeding our expectations across all geographic regions. Additionally, larger sized LCD televisions were the fastest growing size category in 2011 and have resulted in area growth rates that were even higher than unit growth rates. However, because Corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers, supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry are key factors in Cornings sales volume. While end market demand continues to grow in all LCD applications, inventory levels within the LCD supply chain have not kept pace with this growth, and have, in fact, declined in absolute terms during 2011 when compared to 2010, resulting in lower volume and excess capacity in the supply chain. As a result, Corning announced in the fourth quarter of 2011 that it would reduce capacity at our wholly owned business by delaying the start up of new glass melting tanks, as well as postponing the relight of tanks that were removed from service for normal repair. Our equity affiliate, Samsung Corning Precision, took similar actions in the fourth quarter of 2011. The slight increase in net sales in the Display Technologies segment in 2011, compared to 2010, was driven primarily by the favorable impact of approximately $300 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate. Volume growth in 2011 was more than offset by price declines, when compared to 2010. When compared to 2010, the decrease in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision in 2011 reflected volume and price declines, offset somewhat by the favorable impact of approximately $120 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. Equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar Japanese yen and U.S. dollar Korean won exchange rates. The impact of the supply chain contraction and excess capacity has been more severe in Korea, resulting in higher price and volume declines at Samsung Corning Precision than at our wholly owned business. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2011, although Samsung Corning Precision significantly reduced its glass pricing in light of the current state of glass supply in the industry, it did not recover market share that was lost in the third quarter. Due to these market dynamics, Samsung Corning Precision reduced its glass melting capacity, as described above. Equity earnings were also negatively impacted by higher taxes due to the partial expiration of a Korean tax holiday and the absence of a $61 million credit for our share of a revised tax holiday calculation agreed to by the Korean National Tax service recorded in 2010. When compared to 2010, the decrease in net income in the Display Technologies segment in 2011 reflects the impact of lower equity earnings, price declines and a decrease in royalty income, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiency and the favorable impact of approximately $230 million from foreign exchange rate movements. Net income was also negatively impacted by the absence of a pre tax credit recorded in 2010 in the amount of $324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims. 32 A number of Cornings patents and know how are licensed to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generates royalty income. Royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision decreased in 2011, when compared to 2010, reflecting the decline in sales volume at Samsung Corning Precision. Corning and Samsung Corning Precision have agreed that, for a five year period commencing December 1, 2011, the applicable royalty rate will be reduced by approximately 50% compared to the prior five years. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about related party transactions. 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in net sales in 2010 when compared to 2009 reflected an increase in volume of more than 25% and the positive impact of $179 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by price declines of 8%. Volume gains in 2010 were led by strong growth in demand for LCD televisions outside of the United States, coupled with a replenishment of this industrys supply chain. Equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision in 2010 increased by 32% when compared to 2009 due to volume gains of almost 20%, improved manufacturing performance, and by the positive impact of $90 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by price declines of 7%. Equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar Japanese yen and U.S. dollar Korean won exchange rates. Equity earnings were also positively impacted by a $61 million credit for our share of a revised Samsung Corning Precision tax holiday calculation agreed to by the Korean National Tax service. When compared to 2009, the increase in net income in 2010 primarily reflects the impact of the volume increases described above at both our wholly owned business and Samsung Corning Precision and the impact of an insurance settlement for business interruption and property damage insurance claims, partially offset by price declines. The insurance settlement relates to two events in 2009 which impacted production at our LCD glass manufacturing facilities. In August 2009, an earthquake halted production at one of our LCD glass manufacturing facilities in Japan and, in October 2009, production at our facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. We recorded a pre tax credit in 2010 in the amount of $324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims related to these two events. Results also improved due to the absence of $31 million of restructuring charges impacting 2009 net income. Net income included royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision that was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009, reflecting the improvements in sales volume at Samsung Corning Precision. Net income in 2010 also includes the favorable impact of $182 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009. Other Information The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan, China and Taiwan. In 2011, four customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a combined 77% of total segment sales. For 2010 and 2009, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 72% and 62%, respectively, of total segment sales when totaled. Our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues, our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products. In addition, Samsung Corning Precisions sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea accounted for approximately 93% of Samsung Corning Precision sales in each of those three years. Corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, capital spending in this segment was $1.3 billion, $497 million, and $552 million, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2012 to be approximately $800 million, of which approximately $400 million will be related to spending from 2011 capital projects. In 2005 and 2004, several of Cornings customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which Cornings Display Technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. We received our last deposit of $105 million in July 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we issued $28 million, $83 million, and $253 million, respectively, in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. As of December 31, 2011, no additional deposits have been received and all amounts previously owed as credits have been applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. Refer to Note 11 (Other Liabilities) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 33 Outlook: We expect the overall LCD glass retail market to increase from 3.2 billion square feet in 2011 to approximately 3.6 billion square feet in 2012. We believe that the long term market drivers will be LCD television growth, driven by growth of larger sized LCD televisions and increased demand in emerging regions, as well as continued growth in the personal computer market. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect volume at our wholly owned business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2011. We anticipate volume at Samsung Corning Precision to be flat to down in the double digits, depending upon the outcome of negotiations with a key customer, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect cumulative double digit price declines over the two quarter period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. The end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending, among other things. We are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions, particularly a global economic recession, excess market capacity and world political tensions could have on consumer demand. While the industry has grown rapidly in recent years, economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, prices, or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. We may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment. Telecommunications (dollars in millions): % change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Net sales: Optical fiber and cable $ 1,051 $ 878 $ 909 20 (3 ) Hardware and equipment 1,021 834 768 22 9 Total net sales $ 2,072 $ 1,712 $ 1,677 21 2 Net income $ 195 $ 98 $ 19 99 416 2011 vs. 2010 In 2011, net sales of the Telecommunications segment increased when compared to 2010 due to higher sales in all of the segments product lines, led by fiber to the premises, optical fiber and cable, and enterprise network products. Sales of fiber to the premises products increased 39%, driven by initiatives in Canada, Europe and Australia. Optical fiber and cable sales growth reflected record volume, moderating price declines and an increase in sales of premium products. Sales also increased due to a small acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2011 and the positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of $20 million. The increase in net income in 2011 when compared to 2010 reflects higher volume across all product lines and an increase in sales of higher margin products, coupled with a credit in the amount of $27 million for the decrease in a contingent liability associated with a first quarter acquisition. The increase in net income was offset slightly by the impact of higher raw materials and project costs associated with our initiatives in Australia and Europe. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented. The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2011, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 12% of total segment net sales. In 2010, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 15% of total segment net sales. In 2009, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 12% of total segment net sales. 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales for the segment were up when compared to 2009. Higher sales of enterprise network products and optical fiber and cable in North America and Europe were offset somewhat by lower sales of fiber to the premises products and optical fiber and cable products in Asia, as well as the absence of sales from two businesses sold in 2009. Sales from the two businesses sold totaled $49 million. Net sales in 2010 were negatively impacted by $11 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, when compared to 2009. 34 The increase in net income in 2010 reflected the absence of restructuring charges from 2009, volume strength in enterprise network products, and the impact of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction efforts. Net income of this segment in 2009 included $42 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce. Net income in 2010 includes the favorable impact of $10 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, when compared to 2009. Outlook: We expect another strong year of sales growth in the Telecommunications segment in 2012, driven by an increase in global demand for our optical fiber and cable, fiber to the premises and enterprise network products. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect net sales of this segment to increase between 5% and 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Changes in our customers expected deployment plans, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products, could also affect sales levels. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. Environmental Technologies (dollars in millions): % change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Net sales: Automotive $ 476 $ 462 $ 360 3 28 Diesel 522 354 230 47 54 Total net sales $ 998 $ 816 $ 590 22 38 Net income (loss) $ 121 $ 43 $ (42 ) 181 * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2011 vs. 2010 When compared to 2010, net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased in 2011, primarily due to higher sales of diesel products. The increase was driven by an increase in truck production in the United States, implementation of European governmental regulations on light duty diesel vehicles, and the first stages of the implementation of off road vehicle regulations in the United States. Sales of our automotive products also increased slightly in 2011, when compared to 2010, reflecting the continuing growth of worldwide automotive production. Net sales of this segment in 2011 were positively impacted by $13 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010. Net income in 2011 increased 181%, when compared to 2010, due to higher sales volume for our diesel products, combined with reduced air freight expense and improved manufacturing performance in both diesel and automotive product lines. The increase in net income was slightly offset by higher depreciation and project costs on manufacturing capacity expansion. Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted the results of this segment in the amount of $3 million when compared to 2010. The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers. For 2011, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 85% of total segment sales. For 2010, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 86% of total segment sales. For 2009, net sales to those same three customers accounted for 85% of total segment sales. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers, our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products. 35 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales for the Environmental Technologies segment in 2010 were up 38% when compared to 2009 and reflected higher volumes of both automotive and diesel products, offset somewhat by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. In 2009, automotive vehicle sales declined with the worldwide recession and production was significantly below vehicle sales volumes as manufacturers and dealers decreased inventories. In 2010, as automotive markets in the United States and Europe improved and China continued to expand, manufacturers and dealers increased inventories and production levels, resulting in a 25% increase in automotive production when compared to 2009. Diesel product sales increased 54% reflecting an improvement in the truck market in the United States and implementation of governmental regulations in Europe. Net sales of this segment in 2010 were negatively impacted by $11 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009. Net income in 2010 increased due to higher sales volumes and improvements in manufacturing performance, offset somewhat by higher freight costs, when compared to 2009. Net income in 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges in comparison to the previous year. In 2009, net loss of this segment included $28 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. Net income in 2010 included the negative impact of $9 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2009. Outlook: We expect net sales of this segment to continue to be strong in 2012, due to strong growth in demand for diesel products in the United States freight market and related truck production, and continued implementation of governmental regulations of non road regulations in the United States and Europe. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect net sales of this segment to be up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Specialty Materials (dollars in millions): % change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Net sales $ 1,074 $ 578 $ 331 86 75 Net loss $ (36 ) $ (32 ) $ (54 ) * * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2011 vs. 2010 The Specialty Materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Consequently, this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include display optics and components, semiconductor optics components, aerospace and defense, astronomy, ophthalmic products, telecommunications components and a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices and televisions. Net sales in 2011 increased significantly in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by sales of Corning Gorilla Glass, which more than doubled when compared to last year, and a modest increase in semiconductor optics and aerospace and defense products. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales of this segment in 2011. Sales of Corning Gorilla Glass increased considerably, especially during the first nine months of the year, due to a combination of strong retail demand for handheld display devices, tablets and notebook computers, and increased usage of our glass on these devices. Although sales of Corning Gorilla Glass used in our large cover glass products increased in 2011 when compared to 2010, sales were significantly below our expectations in 2011 and are expected to be lower than forecasted in 2012. As a result, certain assets located in Japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2011. This asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process. The Specialty Materials segment reduced capacity for its Corning Gorilla Glass products, including the impairment of large cover glass assets, in the fourth quarter of 2011 as part of Cornings worldwide capacity reduction of approximately 25%. The slight increase in net loss in 2011 when compared to 2010 was driven by the large cover glass asset impairment charge in the amount of $130 million (pre tax), offset by the considerable increase in sales volume of our Corning Gorilla Glass used in handheld display devices, tablets and notebook computers. Net income was also impacted somewhat by declines in manufacturing efficiency caused primarily by start up costs for large cover glass and glass tank conversions necessary to increase manufacturing capacity for Corning Gorilla Glass in 2011, as well as the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates in the amount of $22 million. 36 For 2011, two customers of the Specialty Materials segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 42% of total segment sales. For 2010, three customers of the Specialty Materials segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 43% of total segment sales. In 2009, there were no individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of this segments net sales. 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales increased in 2010 due to higher sales of Corning Gorilla Glass and an increase in sales of display components and semiconductor optics and components when compared to 2009. Sales of Corning Gorilla Glass increased as the Company moved to capitalize on market opportunities for this product. The lower net loss in 2010 was driven by higher sales of our Corning Gorilla Glass products and the absence of restructuring charges, offset somewhat by the costs associated with adding capacity. The net loss in 2009 includes $17 million of restructuring charges for the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce. In 2010, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment. Outlook: For 2012, we expect sales of this segment to be led by Corning Gorilla Glass. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect net sales to be up slightly driven by Corning Gorilla Glass, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Life Sciences (dollars in millions): % change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Net sales $ 595 $ 508 $ 366 17 39 Net income $ 61 $ 60 $ 39 * 54 * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. 2011 vs. 2010 Net sales in 2011 increased when compared to 2010 due to a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher sales in the segments existing product lines. Net sales in 2011 include the favorable impact of $7 million from movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2010. Net income in 2011 was consistent with 2010, reflecting costs for manufacturing expansion projects, higher raw materials costs and the impact of the integration of the acquisition completed in 2010, offset by modest volume and price increases. Net income of this segment was positively impacted by $4 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year. For 2011, two customers in the Life Sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 39% of total segment sales. For 2010, two customers in the Life Sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 37% of total segment sales. For 2009, two customers in the Life Sciences segment which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45% of total segment sales. 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in net sales in 2010 was driven primarily by the acquisition of Axygen, which was completed in the third quarter of 2009, and a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. These acquisitions supported the Companys strategy to expand Cornings portfolio of life sciences products and enhance global customer access in this business, and accounted for $117 million of the increase in sales in 2010 when compared to 2009. The segments existing products lines also showed strong sales growth in 2010, improving $25 million when compared to 2009. The improvement in net income in 2010 reflected the sales increases as described above, offset somewhat by higher cost of materials and expenses associated with the integration of Axygen. Net income for 2010 also reflected the absence of restructuring charges when compared to 2009. For 2009, net income of this segment included $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the Companys corporate wide restructuring plan. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net sales or net income for this operating segment. 37 Outlook: Sales of the Life Sciences segment for 2012 are expected to be strong, primarily due to an increase in organic sales and the impact of a small acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect net sales to be up approximately 10% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, driven partially by the impact of a full quarter of results for the small acquisition completed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. All Other (dollars in millions): % change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Net sales $ 6 $ 7 $ 5 (14 ) 40 Research, development and engineering expenses $ 98 $ 114 $ 125 (14 ) (9 ) Equity earnings of affiliated companies $ 15 $ 45 $ 32 (67 ) 41 Net loss $ (78 ) $ (75 ) $ (80 ) * * * The percentage change calculation is not meaningful. All Other includes all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting. This group is primarily comprised of development projects that involve the use of various technologies for new products such as advanced flow reactors, thin film photovoltaics and adjacency businesses in pursuit of thin, strong glass. This segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD glass businesses, Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates, which manufacture smooth cooktop glass/ceramic products, and Corsam Technologies LLC (Corsam), an equity affiliate established between Corning and Samsung Corning Precision to provide glass technology research. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about Samsung Corning Precision and related party transactions. 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in net loss in 2011 when compared to 2010 in this segment was driven by lower equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precisions non LCD glass businesses, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses. 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in the net loss in this segment for 2010 is primarily due to improved equity earnings from corporate investments and lower operating costs, offset by the costs of exiting our synthetic green laser program and the start up costs for new business development projects. 38 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financing and Capital Structure The following items impacted Cornings financing and capital structure during 2011 and 2010: On October 5, 2011, Cornings Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of common stock between the date of the announcement and December 31, 2013. We repurchased 55 million shares of common stock for $780 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 as part of this program. In the second quarter of 2011, a wholly owned subsidiary entered into a credit facility that allows Corning to borrow up to Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 4.0 billion, or approximately $635 million when translated to United States dollars. Corning may request advances during the eighteen month period beginning on June 30, 2011 (the Availability Period). Corning will repay the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest outstanding at the end of the Availability Period in six installments, with the final payment due five years from the date of the first advance. Amounts borrowed are being used to finance capital expenditures related to the construction of a LCD glass substrate facility in Beijing, China. During 2011, Corning borrowed approximately $120 million on this credit facility. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the following debt related transactions: We borrowed $1.1 billion under our revolving credit facility. Corning used the funds in connection with a previously announced plan to repatriate approximately $1.1 billion to the United States. The borrowing was repaid in full on December 16, 2010. We exercised our option to repurchase $100 million of 6.05% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2015 at par. The net carrying amount of the debt repurchased was $100 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received a special dividend of almost $900 million, net of applicable withholding taxes, from our equity affiliate Samsung Corning Precision. In the third quarter of 2010, we completed the following debt related transactions: We issued $400 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2040 and $300 million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes that mature on August 15, 2020. The net proceeds of $689 million from the offering were used to fund the repurchase of debt securities and for general corporate purposes. We repurchased $126 million of our 6.2% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and $100 million of our 5.9% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and recognized a pre tax loss of $30 million upon the early redemption of these notes. In the first quarter of 2010, we repaid $58 million of debt, which included the redemption of $48 million principal amount of our 6.25% notes due February 18, 2010. On October 5, 2011, Cornings Board of Directors declared a 50% increase in the companys quarterly common stock dividend. Cornings quarterly dividend increased from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share. In December 2010, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to provide a $1.0 billion committed, unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through December 2015. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. Capital Spending Capital spending totaled $2.4 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.9 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital spending increased significantly in 2011 when compared to 2010 and 2009, driven largely by several multi year investment plans announced in 2010 that will increase manufacturing capacity in several of our reportable segments. Specifically, the increase in spending in 2011 was driven by construction costs for an LCD glass substrate facility in China for our Display Technologies segment and a capacity expansion project for Specialty Materials Corning Gorilla Glass in Japan. We expect our 2012 capital spending to be about $1.8 billion. Approximately $800 million will be allocated to our Display Technologies segment, of which approximately $400 million will be related to 2011 capital projects. 39 Cash Flows Summary of cash flow data (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,189 $ 3,835 $ 2,077 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,056 ) $ (1,769 ) $ (1,370 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (980 ) $ (2 ) $ (15 ) 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2011 when compared to 2010, driven largely by a non recurring special dividend of almost $900 million received from Samsung Corning Precision in 2010 and a decrease in cash from changes in working capital. Additionally, in 2011, we received $66 million for the remainder of the settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims, a decrease of $193 million from the amount we received in 2010 as partial payment for these claims. These negative events were partially offset by a $350 million decrease in contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2011 when compared to 2010 due to an increase in capital spending and two small acquisitions completed in 2011. Capital spending was driven primarily by capacity projects to support growth in demand in our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by higher cash received from short term investments liquidations. Net cash used in financing activities increased in 2011 when compared to 2010, driven by common stock repurchases and an increase in our dividend rate from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 Operating cash flow increased significantly in 2010 when compared to 2009, driven largely by a special dividend of almost $900 million received from Samsung Corning Precision. We also recorded a credit in the amount of $324 million as settlement of business interruption and property damage insurance claims, and received cash totaling $259 million from our panel of insurance carriers representing a partial payment of this settlement. Additionally, we issued less credits against customer deposits in 2010 when compared to 2009. These positive events were partially offset by higher contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in 2010 and the decrease in cash from changes in working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was higher in 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in short term investment purchases and higher capital expenditures, offset by lower costs for the acquisition of businesses. Net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2010 primarily due to the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, offset somewhat by the net cash impact of financing activities. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Cornings U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2011, this plan accounted for 81% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and 91% of the related plans assets. We have historically contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2013. In 2011, we made no voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $5 million to our international pension plans. In 2010, we made voluntary cash contributions of $350 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $5 million to our international pension plans. In 2008, we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by $33 million. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable driven by the performance of public equity markets, commodities and long duration fixed income securities. 40 Although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2012, we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to $75 million to our U.S. pension plan and up to $30 million to our international pension plans in 2012. Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Customer Deposits Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment entered into long term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates. The deposits were reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods. Between 2004 and 2007, we received a total of $937 million for customer deposit agreements. We received our last deposit of $105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we issued credit memoranda which totaled $28 million, $83 million, and $253 million, respectively. These credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. As of December 31, 2011, no additional deposits have been received and all amounts previously owed as credits have been applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. Dividends from Equity Companies In the third quarter of 2011, Corning Hungary Data Services LLC and Samsung Electronics Corporation, as shareholders of Samsung Corning Precision, agreed to have Samsung Corning Precision increase its annual dividend to shareholders from 40% to 70% of its net income from the previous year, subject to the maintenance of minimum cash balances. Restructuring In 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million associated with a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. The charge included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, asset write offs, and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $150 million primarily related to termination benefits. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we made payments of $16 million, $66 million, and $89 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges (Credits)) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Key Balance Sheet Data Balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions): December 31, 2011 2010 Working capital $ 6,580 $ 6,873 Working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 755 $ 523 Current ratio 4.1:1 4.5:1 Trade accounts receivable, net of allowances $ 1,082 $ 973 Days sales outstanding 52 50 Inventories $ 975 $ 738 Inventory turns 4.7 5.4 Days payable outstanding (1) 42 42 Long term debt $ 2,364 $ 2,262 Total debt to total capital 10% 11% (1) Includes trade payables only. 41 Credit Ratings As of February 13, 2012, our credit ratings were as follows: RATING AGENCY Ratinglong term debt Outlook last update Fitch A Stable May 17, 2011 Standard & Poors BBB+ Stable July 2, 2007 Moodys A3 Stable September 12, 2011 Management Assessment of Liquidity We ended the fourth quarter of 2011 with over $5.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The Company has adequate sources of liquidity and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. At December 31, 2011 approximately 65% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the U.S. Almost all of the amounts held outside of the U.S. are available for repatriation, subject to relevant tax consequences. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we repatriated to the U.S. approximately $1.1 billion of 2010 earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. We expect previously accumulated non U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. In addition to the cash repatriated in 2010, we expect that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. Realized gains and losses for 2011 and 2010 were not significant. Volatility in financial markets may limit Cornings access to capital markets and result in terms and conditions that by historical comparisons are more restrictive and costly to Corning. Still, from time to time, we may issue debt, the proceeds of which may be used to refinance certain debt maturities and for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 3 (Available for Sale Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2011, we repurchased 55 million shares of common stock for $780 million as part of a share repurchase program announced on October 5, 2011. There were no repurchases in 2010 or 2009. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues. Our major source of funding for 2012 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, as well as proceeds from any potential issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, our share repurchase program, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, and dividend payments. Corning also has access to two credit facilities, a $1.0 billion unsecured committed revolving line of credit and a 4.0 billion Chinese Renminbi (RMB) credit agreement (approximately $635 million when translated to USD). These two credit facilities include two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our leverage using this measure was 10% and 11%, respectively. The required interest coverage ratio, which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility, compared to interest expense, is a ratio of at least 3.5 times. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 41.7 times and 40.2 times, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. 42 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby a default on one debt obligation of the Company in excess of a specified amount, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all such provisions. Management is not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Cornings off balance sheet arrangements include the following: Guarantee contracts; and Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities. At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entitys net assets excluding variable interests. Corning has identified four entities that qualify as variable interest entities. None of these entities is considered to be significant to Cornings consolidated statements of position. Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity. 43 Contractual Obligations The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions): Amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period Total Less than1 year 1 to 2years 2 to 3years 3 to 4years 5 years andthereafter Performance bonds and guarantees $ 36 $ 24 $ 4 $ 2 $ 4 $ 2 Credit facilities for equity companies 75 25 25 25 Stand by letters of credit (1) 59 57 2 Subtotal of commitment expirations per period $ 170 $ 106 $ 31 $ 27 $ 4 $ 2 Purchase obligations $ 72 $ 42 $ 22 $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 Capital expenditure obligations (2) 472 472 Total debt (3) 2,118 27 127 190 34 1,740 Interest on long term debt (4) 1,921 153 162 136 121 1,349 Minimum rental commitments 218 51 42 35 30 60 Capital leases (3) 236 2 2 2 2 228 Imputed interest on capital leases 161 13 13 13 13 109 Uncertain tax positions (5) 6 4 1 1 Subtotal of contractual obligation payments due by period 5,204 764 369 380 203 3,488 Total commitments and contingencies $ 5,374 $ 870 $ 400 $ 407 $ 207 $ 3,490 (1) At December 31, 2011, $41 million of the $59 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Capital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with our capital expansion activities. (3) At December 31, 2011, $2.4 billion was included on our balance sheet. Total debt above is stated at maturity value. (4) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments. (5) At December 31, 2011, $11 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $5 million of that amount will become payable. We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees. Generally, third party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy related take or pay contracts. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded. ENVIRONMENT Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 18 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Corning had accrued approximately $25 million (undiscounted) and $30 million (undiscounted), respectively, for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Companys liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote. 44 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, follow. Impairment of assets held for use We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets. This review considers all of the Companys precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non manufacturing related purposes. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include: A significant decrease in the market price of an asset; A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition; A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset; A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For long lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used. For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above, the estimated fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach, market approach, cost approach, or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed. All of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals if appropriate for the asset group being reviewed. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include: market size and growth, market share, projected selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate. 45 In the event the current net book value of an asset group is found to be greater than the net present value of the cash flows derived from the asset group, we determine the actual fair market value of long lived assets with the assistance from valuation appraisals conducted by third parties. The results of these valuations generally represent the fair market value of the asset group that will remain after any necessary impairment adjustments have been recorded. The impairment charge will be allocated to assets within the asset group on a relative fair value basis. At December 31, 2011, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $304 million. At December 31, 2010, the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by $415 million. For the current reporting period, the undiscounted cash flow test shows that these precious metal assets, primarily in the Display Technologies segment, are recoverable as part of their asset groupings. The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Specialty Materials segment recorded a $130 million impairment charge related to certain assets located in Japan used in the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass. Large cover glass is primarily used as a cover sheet of strengthened glass for frameless (bezel less) LCD displays. The large cover glass impairment charge represents a write down of assets specific to the glass strengthening process for large size cover glass to their relative fair market values as of the date of impairment. This asset group includes machinery and equipment used in the ion exchange process and facilities dedicated to the ion exchange process. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not identify any instances where the carrying values of our long lived assets were not recoverable. Impairment of Goodwill We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Cornings goodwill relates primarily to the Telecommunications, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences operating segments. Our annual goodwill recoverability assessment has historically been performed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process. This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows. Our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. Our latest detailed assessment was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009, and because we met the required criteria, was carried forward in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we early adopted the guidance found in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 08, which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. It provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The following summarizes our process to assess our goodwill balances for impairment: On a quarterly basis, we assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units which carry goodwill to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The impairment test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. The following events and circumstances will be considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount: Macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and or other developments in equity and credit markets; Market capital in relation to book value; Industry and market considerations, such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing; Cost factors, such as an increase in raw materials, labor or other costs; Overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue; Other relevant entity specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel; and Events affecting a reporting unit, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions. 46 The examples noted above are not all inclusive, and the Company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test. We anticipate performing a detailed goodwill recoverability test in the second half of 2012 and every three years thereafter, unless indicators suggest otherwise. Telecommunications Goodwill for the Telecommunications segment is tested at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit, which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 and the update in 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009. We determined a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion. In evaluating goodwill recoverability in the Telecommunications segment in the fourth quarter of 2011, we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, including but not limited to, consideration of the above factors, we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the Telecommunications reporting unit. Specialty Materials Goodwill for the Specialty Materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below an operating segment, as goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses within this operating segment. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit, which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 and the update in 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009. We determined a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion. In evaluating goodwill recoverability in the fourth quarter of 2011, we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, including but not limited to, consideration of the above factors, we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the Specialty Materials reporting unit. Additionally, the large cover glass impairment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 did not cause a triggering event for goodwill impairment in this reporting unit because the cash flow related to this lower level asset group is not material to this reporting unit. Life Sciences Goodwill for the Life Sciences segment is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is also the operating segment level. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test for this reporting unit, which was evaluated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 and the update in 2010 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 8% was used in 2009. We determined a range of discount rates between 6% and 10% would not have affected our conclusion. In evaluating goodwill recoverability in the fourth quarter of 2011, we assessed qualitative factors in this reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on our qualitative assessment, including but not limited to, consideration of the above factors, we concluded that it is more likely than not that there has not been a significant decrease in the amount that fair value exceeds the carrying value of goodwill in the Life Sciences reporting unit. As a result of the assessment of the qualitative factors, we have determined it is not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test on our reporting units. 47 Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions We are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses. Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment. We are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned. Income taxes We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. Significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included: the long term stabilization of U.S. income from forecasted royalty income in our Display Technologies operating segment, the long term growth of our diesel business, and the future success of new products. Equity method investments At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $4.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 95% of the balance. We review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired. When such indicators are present, we then perform an in depth review for impairment. An impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable. Fair value measures As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Companys own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement. In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest and best use measure should be applied to non financial assets. Cornings major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions. Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. In arriving at the fair value of Cornings derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. Amounts related to credit risk are not material. 48 The Level 3 assets measured with unobservable inputs relate to certain pension asset investments and all long lived assets fair valued on a nonrecurring basis related to the ion exchange process for the production of large cover glass, resulting in an impairment charge of $130 million, which was included in earnings for the period. Refer to Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Probability of litigation outcomes We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case specific issues. See Part II Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives. The proposed asbestos resolution (Amended PCC Plan) is subject to a number of contingencies. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and faces objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is subject to appeal. For these and other reasons, Cornings liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the cost of resolving the non PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to Cornings financial statements is remote. Other possible liabilities We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals. Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB) Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Cornings employee pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. As of December 31, 2011, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,855 million. The following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans: Change in assumption Effect on 2012pre tax pensionexpense Effect onDecember 31, 2011PBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate + 5 million + 77 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate 5 million 75 million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets + 6 million 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets 6 million The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Cornings funding requirements. In addition, at December 31, 2011, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by $104 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by $101 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate. 49 The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Cornings U.S. OPEB plans: Change in assumption Effect on 2012pre tax OPEBexpense Effect onDecember 31, 2011APBO* 25 basis point decrease in discount rate + 1 million + 27 million 25 basis point increase in discount rate 1 million 26 million * Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO). The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Cornings future results. Share Based Compensation Share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects: Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity. We have foreign currency exposure to many currencies including the Japanese yen, Euro, New Taiwan dollar and Korean won. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to reduce the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in Other income, net in the consolidated statements of income. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, were $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively, with foreign based affiliates comprising over 71% of this amount in 2011. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision totaled $1.0 billion for 2011 and $1.5 billion for 2010. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies. We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2011, with respect to open forward contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $275 million compared to $360 million at December 31, 2010. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $241 million compared to $272 million at December 31, 2010. Specific to the Euro, a 10% adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $23 million compared to $83 million at December 31, 2010. As we derive approximately 75% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2012 remain constant at January 2012 levels. As an example of impact changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results, we compare 2011 actual sales in yen and Euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10% change in the currency exchange rate. A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net sales of approximately $410 million. A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net sales of approximately $96 million. Using 2011 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as a percentage of net sales of 36%, we can estimate that a plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of approximately $146 million. A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2011 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of approximately $34 million. Interest Rate Risk Management It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2011, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments. 52
