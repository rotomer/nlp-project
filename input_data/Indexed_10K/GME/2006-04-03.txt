Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, managements plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. General We are the worlds largest retailer of video game products and PC entertainment software. We sell new and used video game hardware, video game software and accessories, as well as PC entertainment software and related accessories and other merchandise. As of January 28, 2006, we operated 4,490 stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, primarily under the names GameStop and EB Games. We also operate electronic commerce web sites under the names gamestop.com and ebgames.com and publish Game Informer, the industrys largest circulation multi platform video game magazine in the United States. Our fiscal year is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2005), January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2004) and January 31, 2004 (fiscal 2003) consisted of 52 weeks. On October 8, 2005, GameStop Holdings Corp. (Historical GameStop), formerly known as GameStop Corp., and Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. (EB or Electronics Boutique) completed their previously announced merger pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 17, 2005 (the Merger Agreement). Upon the consummation of the mergers, Historical GameStop and EB became wholly owned subsidiaries of GameStop Corp., formerly known as GSC Holdings Corp., (the Company), a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of consummating the business combination (the mergers). The mergers of Historical GameStop and EB have been treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, with Historical GameStop designated as the acquirer. Therefore, the historical financial statements of Historical GameStop became the historical financial statements of the Company, the registrant. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto include the results of operations of EB from October 9, 2005 forward. Therefore, the Companys operating results for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 include 16 weeks of EBs results and 52 weeks, respectively, of Historical GameStops results. Management expects sales, sales mix, cost of sales, gross profit, selling general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and interest expense in fiscal 2006 to be significantly impacted by including the operations of EB for a full year, as opposed to 16 weeks in fiscal 2005, which included the holiday selling season. Growth in each of these statement of operations line items will come from each of the Companys business segments. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Historical GameStops stockholders received one share of the Companys Class A common stock for each share of Historical GameStops Class A common stock owned and one share of the Companys Class B common stock for each share of Historical GameStops Class B common stock owned. Approximately 22.2 million shares of the Companys Class A common stock were issued in exchange for all outstanding Class A common stock of Historical GameStop based on the one for one ratio and approximately 29.9 million shares of the Companys Class B common stock were issued in exchange for all outstanding Class B 26 Table of Contents common stock of Historical GameStop based on the one for one ratio. EB stockholders received $38.15 in cash and .78795 of a share of the Companys Class A common stock for each EB share owned. In aggregate, 20.2 million shares of the Companys Class A common stock were issued to EB stockholders at a value of approximately $437.1 million (based on the closing price of $21.61 of Historical GameStops Class A common stock on April 15, 2005, the last trading day before the date the mergers were announced). In addition, approximately $993.3 million in cash was paid in consideration for (i) all outstanding common stock of EB, based upon the pro ration provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) all outstanding stock options of EB. Including transaction costs of $13.6 million, the total consideration paid was approximately $1.4 billion. Growth in the video game industry is driven by the introduction of new technology. In October 2000, Sony introduced PlayStation 2 and, in November 2001, Microsoft introduced Xbox and Nintendo introduced GameCube. Nintendo introduced the Game Boy Advance SP in March 2003 and the DS in November 2004. Sony introduced the PlayStation Portable (the PSP) in March 2005 and Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 in November 2005. As is typical following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware generally increase as a percentage of sales in the first full year following introduction. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the second and third years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the second and third years. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price decreases, further driving sales of related software and accessories. We expect that the installed base of the hardware platforms listed above and sales of related software and accessories will increase in the future. Sony is expected to launch the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo is expected to launch the Revolution in late 2006. We expect that our gross margin in fiscal 2006 will be impacted by the anticipated launches of these new products. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events: Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the Companys financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time of sale. The sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Sales returns (which are not significant) are recognized at the time returns are made. Subscription and advertising revenues are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers and are stated net of sales discounts. Magazine subscription revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period. Merchandise Inventories. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives (ranging from two to eight years). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including renewal options in 27 Table of Contents which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational. The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including managements intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the present value of their projected cash flows. As a result of the mergers and an analysis of assets to be abandoned, the Company impaired assets totaling $9.0 million. Write downs incurred by the Company through January 28, 2006 which were not related to the mergers have not been material. Merger Related Costs. In connection with the mergers, management incurred merger related costs and commenced integration activities which have resulted in, or will result in, involuntary employment terminations, lease terminations, disposals of property and equipment and other costs and expenses. Approximately $65.7 million of these costs and expenses were charged to acquisition costs, representing a portion of the recorded goodwill, and approximately $21.1 million were charged to costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The liability for involuntary termination benefits covers severance amounts, payroll taxes and benefit costs for approximately 680 employees, primarily in general and administrative functions in EBs Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center and Nevada call center, which are expected to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2006. Termination of these employees began in October 2005 and is expected to be completed by July 2006. Certain senior executives with EB received payments in the amount of $4.0 million in accordance with employment contracts. The Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center are owned facilities which are currently being marketed for sale and are classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as Assets held for sale. Sale of these facilities is expected to occur in fiscal 2006. The liability for lease terminations is associated with stores and the Nevada call center to be closed and will be paid over the remaining lease terms through 2015 if the Company is unsuccessful in negotiating lease terminations or sublease agreements. The Company began closing these stores in fiscal 2005 and intends to close the remainder of these stores in the next 12 to 24 months. The disposals of property and equipment are related to assets of Historical GameStop which are either impaired or have been, or will be, either abandoned or disposed of due to the mergers. Certain costs associated with the disposition of these assets remain as an accrual until the assets are disposed of and the costs are paid, which is expected to occur in the next few months. Merger related costs include professional fees, financing costs and other costs associated with the mergers and include certain ongoing costs associated with integrating the operations of Historical GameStop and EB, including relocation costs. The Company is working to finalize integration plans which may result in additional involuntary employment terminations, lease and other contractual terminations and employee relocations. The Company will finalize integration plans and related liabilities in fiscal 2006 and management anticipates completion of all integration activities in fiscal 2006. Finalization of integration plans may result in additional liabilities which will increase goodwill. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information on the merger costs and related liabilities. Goodwill. Goodwill, aggregating $340.0 million was recorded in the acquisition of Funco in 2000 and through the application of push down accounting in accordance with SAB 54 in connection with the acquisition of Babbages in 1999 by a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, Inc. (Barnes & Noble). Goodwill in the amount of $2.9 million was recorded in connection with the acquisition of Gamesworld Group Limited in 2003. Goodwill in the amount of $1,071.5 million was recorded in connection with the mergers. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis. In accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), the Company completed annual impairment tests of the goodwill attributable to its reporting unit as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Through January 29, 2005, the Company determined that it had one reporting unit based upon the similar economic characteristics of its operations. Fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using market capitalization methodologies. Subsequent to the mergers, the Company determined that it has four reporting units, the United States, Australia, Canada and 28 Table of Contents Europe, based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations in those regions. The Company employed the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of goodwill resulting from the mergers to the four reporting units as of October 8, 2005, the date of the mergers. The Company also completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company provides additional information concerning goodwill. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of non compete agreements, point of sale software and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests acquired in the mergers and are included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is approximately four years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized, with no expected residual value. The deferred financing fees associated with the Companys revolving credit facility and the senior notes and senior floating rate notes issued in connection with the financing of the mergers are separately shown in the consolidated balance sheet. The deferred financing fees are being amortized over five, six and seven years to match the terms of the revolving credit facility, the senior floating rate notes and the senior notes, respectively. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors. The Company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs, in accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02 16 or EITF 02 16, results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The Company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year, the Company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods, including estimates of full year vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory. Estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases. Determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known. Although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances. In addition, management believes that the Companys revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances, but management is unable to quantify the impact. Lease Accounting. As previously disclosed, in fiscal 2004, the Company, similar to many other retailers, revised its method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability) and leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) to conform to GAAP, as clarified by the Chief Accountant of the SEC in a February 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For all stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company had calculated straight line rent expense using the initial lease term, but was generally depreciating leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial lease term plus the option periods. The Company corrected its calculation of straight line rent expense to include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which it is reasonably assured of exercising lease options and to include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed (rent holiday). The Company also corrected its calculation of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements for those leases which do not include an option period. Because the effects of the correction were not material to any previous years, a non cash, after tax adjustment of $3.3 million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to correct the method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability). Of the $3.3 million after tax adjustment, $1.8 million pertained to the 29 Table of Contents accounting for rent holidays, $1.4 million pertained to the calculation of straight line rent expense to include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which the Company is reasonably assured of exercising lease options and $0.1 million pertained to the calculation of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements for the small portion of leases which do not include an option period. The aggregate effect of these corrections relating to prior years was $1.9 million ($0.9 million for fiscal 2003 and $1.0 million for years prior to fiscal 2003). The correction does not affect historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 utilizes an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. We generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has been evaluating the accounting for uncertain tax positions and is likely to issue guidance during 2006 for all companies to follow. We believe our current processes are consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain income statement items as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Fiscal Year Fiscal Year Ended Ended Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, 2006 2005 2004 Statement of Operations Data: Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 71.8 72.4 72.6 Gross profit 28.2 27.6 27.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 19.4 20.2 19.0 Depreciation and amortization 2.2 2.0 1.8 Merger related expenses 0.4 Operating earnings 6.2 5.4 6.6 Interest expense (income), net 0.8 0.0 0.0 Merger related interest expense 0.2 Earnings before income taxes 5.2 5.4 6.6 Income tax expense 1.9 2.1 2.6 Net earnings 3.3 % 3.3 % 4.0 % The Company includes purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, rather than cost of goods sold, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 these purchasing, receiving and distribution costs amounted to $20.6 million, $9.2 million and $9.5 million, respectively. The Company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales, rather than selling, general and administrative expenses, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 these processing fees amounted to $20.9 million, $12.0 million and $10.7 million, respectively. As a result of these classifications, 30 Table of Contents our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net effect of the Companys classifications is that its cost of sales as a percentage of sales is higher than, and its selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are lower than, they would have been had the Companys treatment conformed with those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses, by 0.0%, 0.2% and 0.1% for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. The following table sets forth sales (in millions) by significant product category for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, 2006 2005 2004 Percent Percent Percent Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales: New video game hardware $ 503.2 16.3 % $ 209.2 11.4 % $ 198.1 12.6 % New video game software 1,244.9 40.3 % 776.7 42.1 % 647.9 41.0 % Used video game products 808.0 26.1 % 511.8 27.8 % 403.3 25.5 % Other 535.7 17.3 % 345.1 18.7 % 329.5 20.9 % Total $ 3,091.8 100.0 % $ 1,842.8 100.0 % $ 1,578.8 100.0 % The following table sets forth gross profit (in millions) and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gross Gross Gross Gross Profit Gross Profit Gross Profit Profit Percent Profit Percent Profit Percent Gross Profit: New video game hardware $ 30.9 6.1 % $ 8.5 4.1 % $ 10.6 5.3 % New video game software 266.5 21.4 % 151.9 19.6 % 128.6 19.9 % Used video game products 383.0 47.4 % 231.6 45.3 % 179.3 44.5 % Other 191.6 35.8 % 117.3 34.0 % 114.4 34.7 % Total $ 872.0 28.2 % $ 509.3 27.6 % $ 432.9 27.4 % Segment Information Following the completion of the mergers, the Company now operates its business in the following segments: United States, Australia, Canada and Europe. Segment results for the United States include retail operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico, electronic commerce web sites under the names gamestop.com and ebgames.com and Game Informer magazine. Segment results for Canada include retail operations in Canada and segment results for Australia include retail operations in Australia and New Zealand. Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 11 European countries. Prior to the mergers, Historical GameStop had operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom which were not material. The mergers significantly increased our operations in foreign currencies, including the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and the Norwegian kroner. 31 Table of Contents Sales by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, 2006 2005 2004 United States $ 2,709.8 $ 1,818.2 $ 1,564.0 Canada 111.4 Australia 94.4 Europe 176.2 24.6 14.8 Total $ 3,091.8 $ 1,842.8 $ 1,578.8 Operating earnings (loss) by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 29, January 31, 2006 2005 2004 United States $ 173.7 $ 102.1 $ 104.8 Canada 7.9 Australia 11.0 Europe 0.1 (3.0 ) (0.4 ) Total $ 192.7 $ 99.1 $ 104.4 Total assets by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): January 28, January 29, 2006 2005 United States $ 2,347.1 $ 897.1 Canada 210.4 Australia 214.7 Europe 242.9 18.9 Total $ 3,015.1 $ 916.0 The Canada and Australia segments have a longer history of operations than the Europe segment and their older store base generates more operating earnings than Europe. As stores in Europe mature, the Company expects operating profit to increase. Because the fiscal 2005 segment results for international operations consist primarily of the results for the 16 weeks of EBs operations owned by the Company, management does not believe that further discussion of the segment results will be meaningful. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Sales increased by $1,249.0 million, or 67.7%, from $1,842.8 million in fiscal 2004 to $3,091.8 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to approximately $996.8 million in sales from EB for the 16 weeks of its operations owned by the Company, approximately $216.0 million in non comparable sales resulting from the 574 net new GameStop stores opened since January 31, 2004 and approximately $29.6 million due to an increase in comparable Historical GameStop store sales of 1.7%. This comparable store sales increase was expected due to the launch of Sony PlayStation Portable in March 2005 and the launch of Microsoft Xbox 360 hardware in November 2005. On a pro forma basis, comparable store sales decreased 1.4% in fiscal 2005. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation. The mergers and the release of the Sony PSP and the Microsoft Xbox 360 led to an increase in new video game hardware sales of $294.0 million, or 140.5%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. New hardware sales increased as a percentage of sales from 11.4% in fiscal 2004 to 16.3% in fiscal 2005 due primarily to the Sony PSP and Microsoft Xbox 360 launches. The mergers led to an increase in new video game software sales of $468.2 million, or 60.3%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. New software sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 42.1% in fiscal 32 Table of Contents 2004 to 40.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the increase in new hardware sales as a percentage of total sales. Used video game product sales also grew due to an increase in store count, efforts to increase the supply of used inventory available for sale and the mergers, with an increase in sales of $296.2 million, or 57.9%, from fiscal 2004. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and character related merchandise, grew 55.2%, or $190.6 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, due to the mergers. Cost of sales increased by $886.3 million, or 66.5%, from $1,333.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $2,219.8 million in fiscal 2005 as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $362.7 million, or 71.2%, from $509.3 million in fiscal 2004 to $872.0 million in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 27.6% in fiscal 2004 to 28.2% in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of increases in vendor allowances received in excess of advertising expenses, which are recorded as a reduction in cost of sales. In fiscal 2005, vendor allowances received in excess of advertising expenses were $74.7 million compared to $29.9 million in fiscal 2004. This increase was due to the ownership of EB during the fourth fiscal quarter, during which much of the years advertising allowances are generated, and due to the launch of the Xbox 360, which generated additional advertising allowances. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new hardware, new software and other products increased due to the increase in vendor allowances received as discussed above. The gross profit on new hardware increased from 4.1% of sales in fiscal 2004 to 6.1% in fiscal 2005. Because new hardware platforms typically have lower margins than established hardware platforms, as expected, the launch of the Sony PSP and the Microsoft Xbox 360 had an offsetting effect on new hardware gross profit as a percentage of sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new software increased from 19.6% in fiscal 2004 to 21.4% in fiscal 2005 due to the increase in vendor allowances received, as discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products increased from 34.0% in fiscal 2004 to 35.8% in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products increased from 45.3% in fiscal 2004 to 47.4% in fiscal 2005 due to increased efforts to monitor margin rates and, following the mergers, the application of GameStops merchandising algorithms to EBs used video game category. The Company expects gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2006 to be impacted by the anticipated launch in late 2006 of two new hardware platforms in the United States and the March 2006 launch of Microsofts Xbox 360 hardware platform in Australia. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $225.9 million, or 60.5%, from $373.4 million in fiscal 2004 to $599.3 million in fiscal 2005. Approximately $165.9 million of this increase was attributable to the mergers and the remainder was due to increases in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution, and corporate office operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 20.2% in fiscal 2004 to 19.4% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to combining the full year results of Historical GameStops operations with the 16 weeks of EBs operations, including the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year typically experiences high leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses due to the holiday selling season. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $2.6 million in fiscal 2005, compared to an immaterial amount of loss in fiscal 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $36.8 million in fiscal 2004 to $66.4 million in fiscal 2005. This increase of $29.6 million was due primarily to depreciation of EBs assets of $22.4 million after the mergers, with the remaining increase due to capital expenditures for 296 new GameStop stores and management information systems and the commencement in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 of full operations in the Companys new distribution facility. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 due to the mergers, continued capital expenditures for new stores and management information systems and due to a full year of depreciation on the Companys new distribution facility. The Companys results of operations for fiscal 2005 include expenses believed to be of a one time or short term nature associated with the mergers, which included $13.6 million included in operating earnings and $7.5 million included in interest expenses. The $13.6 million included $9.0 million in one time charges associated with assets of the Company considered to be impaired because they were redundant as a result of the mergers. The $7.5 million of merger related interest expense resulted primarily from a commitment fee of $7.1 million for bridge 33 Table of Contents financing as a contingency in the event that we were unable to issue the senior notes and senior floating rate notes prior to the consummation of the mergers. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $1.9 million in fiscal 2004 to $5.1 million in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in the average yield on the investments, interest of $0.8 million earned on the investment of the $941.5 million in proceeds of the offering of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes from the issuance date on September 28, 2005 until the date of the mergers on October 8, 2005 and interest income earned by EB after the mergers on its invested assets. Interest expense increased from $2.2 million in fiscal 2004 to $30.4 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the interest incurred on the $650 million senior notes payable and the $300 million senior floating rate notes payable and the interest incurred on the note payable to Barnes & Noble in connection with the repurchase of Historical GameStops Class B common stock in fiscal 2004. Interest expense on the Companys debt is expected to be approximately $80.0 million in fiscal 2006. Income tax expense increased by $21.1 million, from $38.0 million in fiscal 2004 to $59.1 million in fiscal 2005. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 38.4% in fiscal 2004 to 37.0% in fiscal 2005 due to expenses related to the mergers and corporate restructuring. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $93.6 million, from $99.1 million in fiscal 2004 to $192.7 million in fiscal 2005 and an increase in net earnings of $39.9 million, or 65.5%, from $60.9 million in fiscal 2004 to $100.8 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Sales increased by $264.0 million, or 16.7%, from $1,578.8 million in fiscal 2003 to $1,842.8 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in sales was attributable to the $139.0 million in sales resulting from 338 new stores opened since January 31, 2004 and the $94.2 million in additional sales from having a full year of sales in fiscal 2004 from stores that opened in fiscal 2003, compared to a partial year in 2003. Comparable store sales increased a modest 1.7% as increases in video game software sales driven by strong new game releases were offset by declining hardware price points and hardware shortages caused by insufficient quantities manufactured by hardware vendors. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation. The strong new game releases in fiscal 2004 led to an increase in new video game software sales of $128.8 million, or 19.9%, from fiscal 2003 and an increase in new software sales as a percentage of total sales from 41.0% in fiscal 2003 to 42.1% in fiscal 2004. The declining price points and hardware shortages described above curtailed the expected growth in new hardware, resulting in a modest 5.6%, or $11.1 million, increase in sales and a decline in hardware sales as a percentage of total sales from 12.6% in fiscal 2003 to 11.4% in fiscal 2004. Used video game products continued to show strong growth, with an increase in sales of $108.5 million, or 26.9%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 and an increase as a percentage of total sales from 25.5% in fiscal 2003 to 27.8% in fiscal 2004. This growth was due to our store growth in strip centers and the availability of used products for sale caused by trade ins of used video game products in response to the strong new game releases. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and character related merchandise, grew only 4.7%, or $15.6 million, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, as was expected due to a lack of strong new PC accessories and trading cards. Cost of sales increased by $187.6 million, or 16.4%, from $1,145.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $1,333.5 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $76.4 million, or 17.6%, from $432.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $509.3 million in fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 27.4% in fiscal 2003 to 27.6% in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily the result of the shift in sales mix from lower margin new video game hardware to higher margin new video game software and used video game products, as discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new hardware declined from 5.3% in fiscal 2003 to 4.1% in fiscal 2004 due to the expedited freight costs incurred in shipping hardware, which was in short supply, into our stores. The expected continued downward pressure in margin rates on new release titles caused a decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales on new software from 19.9% in fiscal 2003 to 19.6% in fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game 34 Table of Contents products increased from 44.5% in fiscal 2003 to 45.3% in fiscal 2004 due to increased efforts to monitor margin rates. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products remained comparable from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $74.2 million, or 24.8%, from $299.2 million in fiscal 2003 to $373.4 million in fiscal 2004. These increases were primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution, and corporate office operating expenses, the $2.8 million provision for the proposed California labor litigation settlement, the $2.8 million charge attributable to the professional fees related to the spin off of our Class B common shares previously owned by Barnes & Noble and $5.1 million attributable to correcting our method of accounting for rent expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 19.0% in fiscal 2003 to 20.2% in fiscal 2004. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the costs associated with the continued rollout of new stores and the effect these stores have on leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses and investments in our international infrastructure (a combined impact of 0.6% of sales), the provision for the proposed California labor litigation settlement (0.2% of sales), the charge attributable to the professional fees related to the spin off of our Class B common shares (0.2% of sales) and correcting our method of accounting for rent expense (0.3% of sales). Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $29.4 million in fiscal 2003 to $36.8 million in fiscal 2004. This increase of $7.4 million was due to the capital expenditures for new stores and management information systems during the fiscal year. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $1.5 million in fiscal 2003 to $1.9 million in fiscal 2004 due to an increase in the level of investments and the average yield on the investments. Interest expense increased by $1.5 million, from $0.7 million in fiscal 2003 to $2.2 million in fiscal 2004. This increase in interest expense was due to the interest incurred on the note payable to Barnes & Noble in connection with the repurchase of the Companys Class B common stock. Income tax expense decreased by $3.7 million, from $41.7 million in fiscal 2003 to $38.0 million in fiscal 2004. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 39.7% in fiscal 2003 to 38.4% in fiscal 2004 due to corporate restructuring. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to a decrease in operating earnings of $5.3 million, from $104.4 million in fiscal 2003 to $99.1 million in fiscal 2004 and a decrease in net earnings of $2.6 million, or 4.0%, from $63.5 million in fiscal 2003 to $60.9 million in fiscal 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources During fiscal 2005, cash provided by operations was $291.4 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $146.0 million in fiscal 2004 and cash provided by operations of $71.3 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in cash provided by operations of $145.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 resulted from an increase in net income of $39.9 million, primarily due to EBs results of operations since the mergers; an increase in depreciation and amortization of $29.7 million due primarily to the mergers; an increase in the growth in accounts payable, net of growth in merchandise inventories, of $26.8 million caused by growth of the Company and efforts to manage working capital; an increase in the growth of accrued liabilities of $29.9 million due primarily to increases in liabilities for customer reservations caused by the growth of the Company; and a net decrease in prepaid expenses of $19.5 million due primarily to the timing of rent payments at the end of the fiscal 2004. The increase in cash provided by operations of $74.7 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from an excess of the growth of accounts payable over the growth in merchandise inventories of $7.3 million during fiscal 2004 compared to a deficit in the growth of accounts payable compared to the growth in merchandise inventories of $32.7 million during fiscal 2003. The Company invested in merchandise inventories during fiscal 2003 to prepare for the growth of the Company and store openings in fiscal 2004, with an increase in merchandise inventories of $72.7 million during fiscal 2003 compared to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $40.0 million during fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in cash provided by operations from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was also due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of $7.5 million, due primarily to growth in 35 Table of Contents store count and investments in information systems and a net change in prepaid taxes of $21.8 million due to timing of tax payments made in fiscal 2003 for fiscal 2004. Cash used in investing activities was $996.8 million and $98.4 million during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. During fiscal 2005, $886.1 million of cash was used to acquire EB. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 included approximately $9.7 million to complete the build out of our new corporate headquarters and distribution center facility in Grapevine, Texas. The remaining $101.0 million in capital expenditures was used to open 377 new stores, remodel existing stores and invest in information and distribution systems in support of the integration of the operations of EB and Historical GameStop. During fiscal 2004, our capital expenditures included approximately $27.7 million to acquire and begin the build out of our new corporate headquarters and distribution center facility. The remaining $70.6 million in capital expenditures was used to open 338 new stores, remodel existing stores and invest in information systems. Our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened 377 stores in fiscal 2005 and expect to open approximately 400 stores in fiscal 2006. Within the next 12 to 24 months, we intend to rebrand all of the EB stores to the GameStop brand. Projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are approximately $110.0 million, to be used primarily to fund new store openings, rebrand EB stores and invest in distribution and information systems in support of the integration of the operations of EB and Historical GameStop. In October 2005, in connection with the mergers, the Company entered into a five year, $400.0 million Credit Agreement (the Senior Credit Facility), including a $50.0 million letter of credit sub limit, secured by the assets of the Company. The Senior Credit Facility places certain restrictions on the Company and the borrower subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The availability under the Senior Credit Facility is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (x) approximately 70% of eligible inventory and (y) 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 85% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Companys ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options, and repurchase shares is generally prohibited, except that if availability under the Senior Credit Facility is or will be after any such payment equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base the Company may repurchase its capital stock and pay cash dividends. In addition, in the event that credit extensions under the Senior Credit Facility at any time exceed 80% of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The interest rate on the Senior Credit Facility is variable and, at the Companys option, is calculated by applying a margin of (1) 0.0% to 0.25% above the higher of the prime rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (2) 1.25% to 1.75% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 28, 2006 the applicable margin was 0.0% for prime rate loans and 1.50% for LIBOR loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee, currently 0.375%, for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Senior Credit Facility. As of January 28, 2006, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility and letters of credit outstanding totaled $2.3 million. On May 31, 2005, a subsidiary of EB completed the acquisition of Jump Ordenadores S.L.U. (Jump), a privately held retailer based in Valencia, Spain. As of January 28, 2006, Jump had other third party debt of approximately $0.6 million. As of January 28, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with its credit facilities. On September 28, 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. (which was then a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Historical GameStop and is now, as a result of the mergers, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) as co issuer (together with the Company, the Issuers), completed the offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes and, together with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the Notes). At such time, the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes were placed 36 Table of Contents in escrow pending approval of the mergers by Historical GameStops and EBs stockholders, which approval was a condition to the consummation of the mergers. The offering of the Notes was conducted in a private transaction under Rule 144A under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and in transactions outside the United States in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The Notes were sold pursuant to a purchase agreement, dated September 21, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors listed on Schedule I A thereto, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for themselves and as representatives of the several initial purchasers listed on Schedule II thereto (the Purchase Agreement). A copy of the Purchase Agreement was filed as Exhibit 1.1 to Historical GameStops Current Report on Form 8 K, dated September 27, 2005. The Notes were issued under an indenture (the Indenture), dated September 28, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). The Senior Floating Rate Notes were priced at 100%, bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.875% and mature on October 1, 2011. The rate of interest on the Senior Floating Rate Notes as of January 28, 2006 was 8.405% per annum. The Senior Notes were priced at 98.688%, bear interest at 8.0% per annum and mature on October 1, 2012. The Issuers will pay interest on the Senior Floating Rate Notes quarterly, in arrears, every January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding December 15, March 15, June 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The first interest payment was made on the first business day following its due date of January 1, 2006. The Issuers will pay interest on the Senior Notes semi annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2006, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. A copy of the Indenture was filed as Exhibit 4.2 to Historical GameStops Current Report on Form 8 K, dated September 30, 2005. In connection with the closing of the offering, the Issuers also entered into a registration rights agreement, dated September 28, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors listed on Schedule I A thereto, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for themselves and as representatives of the several initial purchasers listed on Schedule II thereto (the Registration Rights Agreement). The Registration Rights Agreement requires the Issuers to, among other things, (1) file a registration statement with the SEC to be used in connection with the exchange of the Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms, (2) use their reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 210 days from the date the Notes were issued, and (3) use their commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the exchange offer with respect to the Notes within 270 days from the date the Notes were issued. In addition, under certain circumstances, including (among other things) the exchange offer not being consummated within 270 days from the date the Notes were issued, the Issuers may be required to file a shelf registration statement. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement was filed as Exhibit 4.3 to Historical GameStops Current Report on Form 8 K, dated September 30, 2005. The Company intends to file a registration statement on Form S 4 in order to register new notes (the New Notes) with the same terms and conditions as the Notes in order to facilitate an exchange of the New Notes for the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture for the Notes, if we do not complete an offer to exchange the Notes for the New Notes by June 23, 2006, the interest rate on the Notes will increase by 25 basis points until we complete the exchange offer. At the scheduled meetings of Historical GameStops and EBs stockholders held on October 6, 2005, the proposal for the business combination was approved. On October 7, 2005, the proceeds of the offering placed in escrow, minus certain fees and expenses of the initial purchasers and others, were released to the Company. Such net proceeds of the offering were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to the stockholders of EB in connection with the mergers. Concurrently with the consummation of the mergers on October 8, 2005, EB and its direct and indirect domestic wholly owned subsidiaries (together, the EB Guarantors) became subsidiaries of the Company and entered into: (1) a first supplemental indenture, dated October 8, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the EB Guarantors and the Trustee, pursuant to which the EB Guarantors assumed all the obligations of a subsidiary guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture; and (2) a joinder agreement, dated October 8, 2005, pursuant to which the EB 37 Table of Contents Guarantors assumed all the obligations of a subsidiary guarantor under the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. Under certain conditions, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions prior to maturity redeem up to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes and or Senior Notes issued under the Indenture at redemption prices at or in excess of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The circumstances which would limit the percentage of the Notes which may be redeemed or which would require the Company to pay a premium in excess of 100% of the principal amount are defined in the Indenture. The Issuers may acquire Senior Floating Rate Notes and Senior Notes by means other than redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers are required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limitations on (1) the incurrence of additional debt, (2) restricted payments, (3) liens, (4) sale and leaseback transactions and (5) asset sales. Events of default provided for in the Indenture include, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal on the Notes, other breaches of covenants in the Indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. On May 25, 2005, a subsidiary of EB closed on a 10 year, $9.5 million mortgage agreement collateralized by a new 315,000 square foot distribution facility located in Sadsbury Township, Pennsylvania. Interest is fixed at a rate of 5.4% per annum. As of January 28, 2006, the outstanding principal balance under the mortgage was approximately $9.3 million. In March 2003, the Board of Directors of Historical GameStop authorized a common stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to $50.0 million of Historical GameStops Class A common shares. Historical GameStop had the right to repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors. During the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2005, Historical GameStop repurchased 959,000 shares at an average share price of $15.64. During the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2004, Historical GameStop repurchased 2,304,000 shares at an average share price of $15.19. From the inception of this repurchase program through January 29, 2005, Historical GameStop repurchased 3,263,000 shares at an average share price of $15.32, totaling $50.0 million, and, as of January 29, 2005, had no amount remaining available for purchases under this repurchase program. The repurchased shares were held in treasury until the consummation of the mergers, at which time the shares were retired and all outstanding shares of Historical GameStop were exchanged for shares of common stock of the Company. In October 2004, the Board of Directors of Historical GameStop authorized a repurchase of Historical GameStop Class B common stock held by Barnes & Noble. Historical GameStop repurchased 6,107,000 shares of Class B common stock at a price equal to $18.26 per share for aggregate consideration of $111.5 million. Historical GameStop paid $37.5 million in cash and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $74.0 million. Scheduled principal payments of $37.5 million and $12.2 million were made in January 2005 and October 2005, respectively. The note also requires payments of $12.2 million each due in October 2006 and October 2007. The note is unsecured and bears interest at 5.5% per annum, payable when principal installments are due. The repurchased shares were immediately retired. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under the Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, required interest payments on the Notes and our note payable to Barnes & Noble, store expansion and remodeling activities and corporate capital expenditure programs for at least the next 12 months. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations (in millions) as of January 28, 2006: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years In millions Long Term Debt(1) $ 1,479.4 $ 91.4 $ 168.8 $ 156.3 $ 1,062.9 Operating Leases $ 1,017.4 $ 197.1 $ 339.3 $ 206.5 $ 274.5 Purchase Obligations(2) $ 420.9 $ 420.9 $ $ $ Involuntary Employment Termination Costs(3) $ 10.2 $ 10.2 $ $ $ Total $ 2,927.9 $ 719.6 $ 508.1 $ 362.8 $ 1,337.4 (1) The long term debt consists of $650.0 million (principal value), which bears interest at 8.0%, $300.0 million of floating rate notes which currently bear interest at 8.4%, $24.3 million which bears interest at 5.5% and $9.3 million which bears interest at 5.4%. Amounts include contractual interest payments (using the interest rate as of January 28, 2006 for the floating rate notes). (2) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. (3) Involuntary employment termination costs include known amounts committed to approximately 680 employees, primarily in general and administrative functions in EBs Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center and Nevada call center, which are expected to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2006. Termination of these employees began in October 2005 and is expected to be completed by July 2006. In addition to minimum rentals, the operating leases generally require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs and may provide for percentage rentals. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term, including renewal options for those leases in which it is reasonably assured that the Company will exercise the renewal option. The Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding. The Company intends to sell the 315,000 square foot distribution facility located in Sadsbury Township, Pennsylvania in fiscal 2006. Under the terms of the mortgage agreement on this facility, we could be liable for an early termination payment of approximately $0.8 million when we sell the facility and retire the mortgage. This early termination payment is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2006 as the Company intends to retire the mortgage if the building is sold in fiscal 2006 and expects to be liable for the early termination penalty. The Company has entered into employment agreements with R. Richard Fontaine, Daniel A. DeMatteo Steven R. Morgan and David W. Carlson. The terms of the employment agreement for Mr. Fontaine and Mr. DeMatteo commenced on April 11, 2005 and continue for a period of three years thereafter, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Morgan commenced on December 9, 2005 and continues through February 12, 2008, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Carlson commenced on April 3, 2006 and continues for a period of two years thereafter, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. Mr. Fontaines minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $650,000. Mr. DeMatteos minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $535,000. The Board of Directors of the Company has set Mr. Fontaines and Mr. DeMatteos salaries for fiscal 2006 at $1,000,000 and $800,000, respectively. Mr. Morgans minimum annual salary during the term of his 39 Table of Contents employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $450,000. Mr. Carlsons minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $350,000. As of January 28, 2006, we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $2.3 million and had no other commercial commitments such as guarantees or standby repurchase obligations outstanding. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company remains contingently liable for the BC Sports Collectibles store leases assigned to Sports Collectibles Acquisition Corporation (SCAC). SCAC is owned by the family of James J. Kim, Chairman of EB at the time and currently one of the Companys directors. If SCAC were to default on these lease obligations, the Company would be liable to the landlords for up to $5.4 million in minimum rent and landlord charges as of January 28, 2006. Mr. Kim has entered into an indemnification agreement with EB with respect to these leases, therefore no accrual was recorded for this contingent obligation. Impact of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions The Company operates departments within ten bookstores operated by Barnes & Noble. The Company pays a license fee to Barnes & Noble in amounts equal to 7.0% of the gross sales of such departments. Management deems the license fee to be reasonable and based upon terms equivalent to those that would prevail in an arms length transaction. During the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, these charges amounted to $0.9 million, $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Until June 2005, Historical GameStop participated in Barnes & Nobles workers compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by Barnes & Noble under these programs were allocated to Historical GameStop based upon Historical GameStops total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history. Management deemed the allocation methodology to be reasonable. During the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, these allocated charges amounted to $1.7 million, $2.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Although Historical GameStop secured its own insurance coverage, costs will likely continue to be incurred by Barnes & Noble on insurance claims which were incurred under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against Historical GameStop will be allocated to the Company. In July 2003, the Company purchased an airplane from a company controlled by a member of the Board of Directors. The purchase price was $9.5 million and was negotiated through an independent third party following an independent appraisal. In October 2004, the Board of Directors of Historical GameStop authorized a repurchase of Historical GameStops Class B common stock held by Barnes & Noble. Historical GameStop repurchased 6,107,000 shares of its Class B common stock at a price equal to $18.26 per share for aggregate consideration of $111.5 million. The repurchase price per share was determined by using a discount of 3.5% on the last reported trade of Historical GameStops Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the time of the transaction. Historical GameStop paid $37.5 million in cash and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $74.0 million, the remaining balance of which is payable in installments over the next two years and bears interest at 5.5% per annum, payable when principal installments are due. Scheduled principal payments of $37.5 million and $12.2 million were made in January 2005 and October 2005, respectively. Interest expense on the promissory note in fiscal 2005 totaled $1.8 million. In May 2005, we entered into an arrangement with Barnes & Noble under which www.gamestop.com is the exclusive specialty video game retailer listed on bn.com, Barnes & Nobles e commerce site. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company pays a fee to Barnes & Noble for sales of video game or PC entertainment products sold through bn.com. For the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, the fee to Barnes & Noble totaled $0.3 million. 40 Table of Contents On November 2, 2002, EB sold its BC Sports Collectibles business to SCAC for $2.2 million in cash and the assumption of lease related liabilities in excess of $13.0 million. The purchaser, SCAC, is owned by the family of James J. Kim, Chairman of EB at the time and currently one of the Companys directors. The transaction was negotiated and approved by a committee of EBs Board of Directors comprised solely of independent directors with the assistance of an investment banking firm engaged to solicit offers for the BC Sports Collectibles business. As EB remains contingently liable for the BC store leases, Mr. Kim has agreed to indemnify EB against any liabilities associated with these leases. In connection with the mergers, Historical GameStop agreed to pay the legal fees and expenses of one if its directors, Leonard Riggio, including legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of Mr. Riggios notification and report form under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Company estimates that Mr. Riggios fees and expenses in connection with the mergers were approximately $150,000. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)). This Statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees. Currently, companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements. We have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect. The fair value concepts were not changed significantly in SFAS 123(R), however, in adopting this Standard, companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions. The valuation model and amortization assumption we have used continue to be available and we intend to continue to use them. SFAS 123(R) will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2006. Transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively, restate results to the beginning of the year, or to restate prior periods with the amounts on a basis consistent with pro forma amounts that have been included in their footnotes. We have concluded that we will adopt on the modified prospective basis. For the pro forma effect on fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, using our existing valuation and amortization assumptions, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10 K. We expect that the implementation of SFAS 123(R) will reduce net income by approximately $10.6 million, $8.5 million and $5.3 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 (the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008) and fiscal 2008 (the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009), respectively, based on the terms and conditions of non vested stock options outstanding as of January 28, 2006. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, (SFAS 154). This Statement defines the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2006. The implementation of SFAS 154 is not expected to have an impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In October 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Staff Position No. 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period, (SFAS SP 13 1). This Statement requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period shall be recognized as rental expense. The rental costs shall be included in income from continuing operations. SFAS SP 13 1 will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2006. However, the Company previously corrected its calculation of straight line rent expense to include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed. The implementation of SFAS SP 13 1 is not expected to have an impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, 41 Table of Contents sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term, highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of one year or less. In addition, the Notes issued in connection with the mergers include both fixed rate and floating rate notes with the intent to minimize exposure to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical increase (or decrease) of 10% of the effective rate on the floating rate notes would result in a change in the annual interest expense of $2.5 million. The effective rate on the floating rate notes was 8.405% on January 28, 2006. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances, and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest. Foreign Currency Risk The mergers significantly increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations because a larger amount of our business is now transacted in foreign currencies. While Historical GameStop generally did not enter into derivative instruments with respect to foreign currency risks, Electronics Boutique routinely used forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to manage currency risk and had a number of open positions designated as hedge transactions as of the merger date. The Company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for all derivative instruments acquired in connection with the mergers. The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 133), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, (SFAS No. 138). SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, depending on the type of hedge transaction. The Company uses forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. The aggregate fair value of these forwards and swaps at January 28, 2006 was a loss of $7.1 million. A hypothetical increase (or decrease) of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates underlying these forwards and swaps from the market rate at January 28, 2006 would result in a (loss) or gain in value of the forwards and swaps of ($7.2 million) or $5.7 million, respectively. The Company had no forward exchange contracts and currency swaps prior to October 8, 2005.
