Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, managements plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. General GameStop Corp. (GameStop or the Company) is the worlds largest retailer of video game products and PC entertainment software. We sell new and used video game hardware, video game software and accessories, as well as PC entertainment software and related accessories and other merchandise. As of February 3, 2007, we operated 4,778 stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, primarily under the names GameStop and EB Games. We also operate electronic commerce websites under the names www.gamestop.com and www.ebgames.com and publish Game Informer, the industrys largest multi platform video game magazine in the United States based on circulation. Our fiscal year is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 (fiscal 2006) consisted of 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2005) and January 29, 2005 (fiscal 2004) consisted of 52 weeks. On October 8, 2005, GameStop Holdings Corp. (Historical GameStop), formerly known as GameStop Corp., and Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. (EB or Electronics Boutique) completed their previously announced mergers pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 17, 2005 (the Merger Agreement). Upon the consummation of the mergers, Historical GameStop and EB became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of consummating the business combination (the mergers). The mergers of Historical GameStop and EB have been treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, with Historical GameStop designated as the acquirer. Therefore, the historical financial statements of Historical GameStop became the historical financial statements of the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto include the results of operations of EB from October 9, 2005 forward. Therefore, the Companys operating results for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 include 16 weeks of EBs results and 52 weeks, respectively, of Historical GameStops results. The Companys operating results for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 include 53 weeks for both Historical GameStop and EB. As a result, sales mix, cost of sales, gross profit, selling general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and interest expense in fiscal 2006 was significantly impacted by including the operations of EB for a full year, as opposed to 16 weeks in fiscal 2005, which included the holiday selling season. Growth in each of these statement of operations line items came from each of the Companys business segments. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Historical GameStops stockholders received one share of the Companys common stock for each share of Historical GameStops common stock owned. Approximately 104.2 million shares of the Companys common stock were issued in exchange for all outstanding common stock of Historical GameStop based on the one for one ratio. EB stockholders received $19.08 in cash and .39398 of a share of the Companys common stock for each share of EB common stock owned. In aggregate, 40.5 million shares of the Companys common stock were issued to EB stockholders at a value of approximately $437.1 million (based on the closing price of $10.81 of Historical GameStops common stock on April 15, 2005, the last trading day before the date the mergers were announced). In addition, approximately $993.3 million in cash was paid in consideration for (i) all outstanding common stock of EB, based upon the pro ration provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) all outstanding stock options of EB. Including transaction costs of $13.6 million, the total consideration paid was approximately $1.4 billion. On February 7, 2007, following approval by a majority of the Class B common stockholders in a Special Meeting of the Companys Class B common stockholders, all outstanding Class B common shares were converted into Class A common shares on a one for one basis (the Conversion). In addition, on February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a two for one stock split, effected by a one for one stock dividend to 27 Table of Contents stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007, paid on March 16, 2007 (the Stock Split). Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been restated to reflect the Conversion and the Stock Split. Growth in the video game industry is driven by the introduction of new technology. In fiscal 2005 in the North American markets, Sony introduced the PlayStation Portable (the PSP) in March and Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 in November. In November 2006, Nintendo introduced the Wii hardware platform worldwide and Sony introduced the PlayStation 3 hardware platform in the North American markets. Typically, following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware increase as a percentage of sales in the first full year following introduction. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the second and third years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the second and third years. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price decreases, further driving sales of related software and accessories. We expect that the installed base of the hardware platforms listed above and sales of related software and accessories will increase in the future. The Companys gross margin in fiscal 2006 was impacted by the recent launches of these new products. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events: Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the Companys financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time of sale. The sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Sales returns (which are not significant) are recognized at the time returns are made. Subscription and advertising revenues are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers and are stated net of sales discounts. Magazine subscription revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period. Gift cards sold to customers are recognized as a liability on the balance sheet until redeemed. Stock Based Compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)). This Statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees in its financial statements. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method beginning on the first day of fiscal 2006. Under SFAS 123(R), the Company records stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures, for all options granted prior to, but not vested as of, the adoption date. In addition, the Company records compensation expense for the share based awards issued after the adoption date in accordance with SFAS 123(R). As of February 3, 2007, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options and restricted stock was $21.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 and 2.0 years, respectively. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information on stock based compensation. Merchandise Inventories. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of 28 Table of Contents the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives (ranging from two to eight years). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including renewal options in which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred to third parties in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational. The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including managements intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected cash flows. As a result of the mergers and an analysis of assets to be abandoned, the Company impaired assets totaling $9.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $1.9 million in fiscal 2006 prior to October 8, 2006, the anniversary of the mergers. These impairment costs are included in merger related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Write downs incurred by the Company through February 3, 2007 which were not related to the mergers have not been material. Merger Related Costs. In connection with the mergers, management incurred merger related costs and integration activities which have resulted in involuntary employment terminations, lease terminations, disposals of property and equipment and other costs and expenses. Approximately $64.3 million of these costs were charged to acquisition costs, representing a portion of the recorded goodwill, and approximately $21.1 million were charged to costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The remaining liability for involuntary termination benefits covers severance amounts, payroll taxes and benefit costs for former EB employees, primarily in general and administrative functions in EBs Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center and Nevada call center which have been closed. Termination of these employees began in October 2005 and is now complete. The Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center were owned facilities that were sold in July 2006. These assets were classified in the January 28, 2006 consolidated balance sheet as Assets held for sale. The liability for lease terminations is associated with stores to be closed. If the Company is unsuccessful in negotiating lease terminations or sublease agreements, the lease liability will be paid over the remaining lease terms, the majority of which expire in the next 3 to 5 years, with the last of such leases expiring in 2015. The Company intends to close these stores in the next 9 to 12 months. The disposals of property and equipment are related to assets which were either impaired or have been either abandoned or disposed of due to the mergers. Certain costs associated with the disposition of these assets remained accrued until the assets were disposed of and the costs were paid. The disposition of property and equipment is now complete. Merger related costs include professional fees, financing costs and other costs associated with the mergers and include certain costs associated with integrating the operations of Historical GameStop and EB, including relocation costs. The Company finalized integration plans and related liabilities and all integration activities in fiscal 2006. Rebranding of EB stores to the GameStop name is expected to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information on the merger costs and related liabilities. Goodwill. Goodwill, aggregating $340.0 million was recorded in the acquisition of Funco in 2000 and through the application of push down accounting in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 54 (SAB 54) in connection with the acquisition of Babbages in 1999 by a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, Inc. (Barnes & Noble). Goodwill in the amount of $2.9 million was recorded in connection with the acquisition of Gamesworld Group Limited in 2003. Goodwill in the amount of $1,074.9 million was recorded in 29 Table of Contents connection with the mergers. Goodwill in the amount of $8.1 million was recorded in the acquisition in January 2007 of Game Brands Inc. (operating as Rhino Video Games stores). Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis. In accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), the Company completed annual impairment tests of the goodwill attributable to its reporting unit as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Until October 8, 2005, the date of the mergers, the Company determined that it had one reporting unit based upon the similar economic characteristics of its operations. Fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using market capitalization methodologies. Subsequent to the mergers, the Company determined that it has four reporting units, the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations and separate management within those regions. The Company employed the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of goodwill resulting from the mergers to the four reporting units as of October 8, 2005. The Company also completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company provides additional information concerning goodwill. Intangible Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets. Intangible assets consist of non compete agreements, point of sale software and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests acquired in the mergers and are included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is approximately four years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized, with no expected residual value. The deferred financing fees associated with the Companys revolving credit facility and the senior notes and senior floating rate notes issued in connection with the financing of the mergers are separately shown in the consolidated balance sheet. The deferred financing fees are being amortized over five, six and seven years to match the terms of the revolving credit facility, the senior floating rate notes and the senior notes, respectively. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors. The Company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs, in accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02 16 or EITF 02 16, results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The Company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year, the Company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods, including estimates of full year vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory. Estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases. Determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known. Although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances. In addition, management believes that the Companys revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances, but management is unable to quantify the impact. Lease Accounting. As previously disclosed, in fiscal 2004, the Company, similar to many other retailers, revised its method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability) and leasehold improvements 30 Table of Contents funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) to conform to GAAP, as clarified by the Chief Accountant of the SEC in a February 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For all stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company had calculated straight line rent expense using the initial lease term, but was generally depreciating leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial lease term plus the option periods. The Company corrected its calculation of straight line rent expense to include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which it is reasonably assured of exercising lease options and to include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed (rent holiday). The Company also corrected its calculation of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements for those leases which do not include an option period. Because the effects of the correction were not material to any previous years, a non cash, after tax adjustment of $3.3 million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to correct the method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability). Of the $3.3 million after tax adjustment, $1.8 million pertained to the accounting for rent holidays, $1.4 million pertained to the calculation of straight line rent expense to include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which the Company is reasonably assured of exercising lease options and $0.1 million pertained to the calculation of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements for the small portion of leases which do not include an option period. The aggregate effect of these corrections relating to prior years was $1.9 million. The correction does not affect historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 utilizes an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. We generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. We were required to adopt FIN 48 effective February 4, 2007. The cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN 48 is to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The Company is evaluating the impact of implementing the provisions of FIN 48 on its financial position and future results of operations, but does not expect that the impact will be material. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain income statement items as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 Statement of Operations Data: Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 72.3 71.8 72.4 Gross profit 27.7 28.2 27.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 18.8 19.4 20.2 Depreciation and amortization 2.1 2.2 2.0 Stock based compensation 0.4 Merger related expenses 0.1 0.4 Operating earnings 6.3 6.2 5.4 Interest expense, net 1.4 0.8 Merger related interest expense 0.2 Debt extinguishment expense 0.1 Earnings before income taxes 4.8 5.2 5.4 Income tax expense 1.8 1.9 2.1 Net earnings 3.0 % 3.3 % 3.3 % The Company includes purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, rather than cost of goods sold, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, these purchasing, receiving and distribution costs amounted to $22.3 million, $20.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively. The Company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales, rather than selling, general and administrative expenses, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 these processing fees amounted to $40.9 million, $20.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net effect of the Companys classifications is that its cost of sales as a percentage of sales is higher than, and its selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are lower than, they would have been had the Companys treatment conformed with those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses, by 0.3%, 0.0% and 0.2% for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. The following table sets forth sales (in millions) by significant product category for the periods indicated: 53 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 Percent Percent Percent Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales: New video game hardware $ 1,073.7 20.2 % $ 503.2 16.3 % $ 209.2 11.4 % New video game software 2,012.5 37.8 % 1,244.9 40.3 % 776.7 42.1 % Used video game products 1,316.0 24.8 % 808.0 26.1 % 511.8 27.8 % Other 916.7 17.2 % 535.7 17.3 % 345.1 18.7 % Total $ 5,318.9 100.0 % $ 3,091.8 100.0 % $ 1,842.8 100.0 % 32 Table of Contents The following table sets forth gross profit (in millions) and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated: 53 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 Gross Gross Gross Gross Profit Gross Profit Gross Profit Profit Percent Profit Percent Profit Percent Gross Profit: New video game hardware $ 77.0 7.2 % $ 30.9 6.1 % $ 8.5 4.1 % New video game software 427.3 21.2 % 266.5 21.4 % 151.9 19.6 % Used video game products 651.9 49.5 % 383.0 47.4 % 231.6 45.3 % Other 315.2 34.4 % 191.6 35.8 % 117.3 34.0 % Total $ 1,471.4 27.7 % $ 872.0 28.2 % $ 509.3 27.6 % Segment Information Following the completion of the mergers, the Company now operates its business in the following segments: United States, Australia, Canada and Europe. Segment results for the United States include retail operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico, the electronic commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.ebgames.com and Game Informer magazine. Segment results for Canada include retail operations in Canada and segment results for Australia include retail operations in Australia and New Zealand. Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 11 European countries. Prior to the mergers, Historical GameStop had operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom which were not material. The mergers significantly increased our operations in foreign currencies, including the euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona and the Norwegian kroner. Sales by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): 53 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 4,269.5 $ 2,709.8 $ 1,818.2 Canada 319.7 111.4 Australia 288.1 94.4 Europe 441.6 176.2 24.6 Total $ 5,318.9 $ 3,091.8 $ 1,842.8 Operating earnings (loss) by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): 53 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 285.4 $ 173.7 $ 102.1 Canada 20.0 7.9 Australia 27.3 11.0 Europe 1.0 0.1 (3.0 ) Total $ 333.7 $ 192.7 $ 99.1 33 Table of Contents Total assets by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): February 3, January 28, January 29, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 2,618.9 $ 2,347.8 $ 897.1 Canada 210.4 210.4 Australia 210.7 214.7 Europe 309.6 242.9 18.9 Total $ 3,349.6 $ 3,015.8 $ 916.0 The Canada and Australia segments have a longer history of operations than the Europe segment and their older store base generates more operating earnings than Europe. As stores in Europe mature, the Company expects operating profit to increase. The segment results for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006 only include operations from Canada, Australia and most of Europe from October 8, 2005 through January 28, 2006 due to the mergers. Prior to the mergers, the Companys international operations only included Ireland and the United Kingdom. Having segment results for fiscal 2006 from Canada, Australia and Europe increased international segment sales and operating earnings as a percentage of total sales and operating earnings from 12.4% and 9.9%, respectively, in fiscal 2005 to 19.7% and 14.5%, respectively, in fiscal 2006. Management does not believe that a further comparison of the international segment results for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 would be meaningful. The notes issued in connection with the mergers are reflected in the U.S. segment. See Note 21 of the consolidated financial statements for more information. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Sales increased by $2,227.1 million, or 72.0%, to $5,318.9 million in the 53 weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to $3,091.8 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2005. Sales for the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006 were $99.1 million. The remaining increase in sales was attributable to approximately $1,408.4 million of sales in EB stores in fiscal 2006 prior to the anniversary of the mergers, approximately $247.1 million in non comparable store sales resulting from the approximately 800 new GameStop stores opened since January 29, 2005, with the remaining increase of $472.5 million due primarily to an increase in comparable store sales. The comparable store sales increase was 11.9% on a pro forma basis for fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 and was expected due to the launch of the Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii in November 2006. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation. The pro forma comparable store sales increase of 11.9% was calculated by using the first 52 weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to the 52 weeks in fiscal 2005. New video game hardware sales increased $570.5 million or 113.4%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the mergers, the 53rd week of sales included in fiscal 2006 and the launches of Microsoft Xbox 360 in November 2005 and Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii in November 2006. New hardware sales increased as a percentage of sales from 16.3% in fiscal 2005 to 20.2% in fiscal 2006 due primarily to the first full year since the Microsoft Xbox 360 launch and due to the launches of the new platforms in 2006. New video game software sales also increased $767.6 million, or 61.7%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the mergers, the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006 and a strong lineup of new video game titles. New software sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 40.3% in fiscal 2005 to 37.8% in fiscal 2006 due to the increase in new hardware sales as a percentage of total sales. Used video game product sales also grew due to the mergers, the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006 and the increase in store count, with an increase in sales of $508.0 million, or 62.9%, from fiscal 2005. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and trading cards, grew 71.1%, or $381.0 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the mergers and the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. Cost of sales increased by $1,627.7 million, or 73.3%, from $2,219.8 million in fiscal 2005 to $3,847.5 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of the mergers, the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006 and the changes in gross profit discussed below. 34 Table of Contents Gross profit increased by $599.4 million, or 68.7%, from $872.0 million in fiscal 2005 to $1,471.4 million in fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from 28.2% in fiscal 2005 to 27.7% in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in hardware sales as a percentage of total sales. New hardware sales carry a lower overall gross profit compared to other sales categories. The increase in hardware sales was driven by new product launches in fiscal 2006. The gross profit on new hardware increased from 6.1% of sales in fiscal 2005 to 7.2% in fiscal 2006 due to an emphasis on selling product replacement plans along with hardware platforms. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new software remained comparable at 21.4% in fiscal 2005 and 21.2% in fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products decreased from 35.8% in fiscal 2005 to 34.4% in fiscal 2006 due to a shift in sales to lower margin products within the other product categories. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products increased from 47.4% in fiscal 2005 to 49.5% in fiscal 2006 due to increased efforts to monitor margin rates and the application of GameStops merchandising algorithms to EBs used video game category for all of fiscal 2006 compared to only the period following the mergers in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $401.1 million, or 67.0%, from $599.0 million in fiscal 2005 to $1,000.1 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the mergers, the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses as well as expenses from the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 19.4% in fiscal 2005 to 18.8% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to synergies obtained from the mergers, including the shut down of EBs corporate headquarters and distribution center. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to ($1.0) million in fiscal 2006, compared to $2.6 million in fiscal 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $66.4 million in fiscal 2005 to $109.9 million in fiscal 2006. This increase of $43.5 million was due primarily to the mergers, with the remaining increase due to capital expenditures for 421 new GameStop stores and the Companys new corporate headquarters and distribution facility. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 due to continued capital expenditures for new stores and management information systems. Beginning January 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method. Under this method, the Company records stock based compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures for all options granted prior to, but not vested as of, the adoption date. In addition, the Company records compensation expense for the share based awards granted after the adoption date in accordance with SFAS 123(R). As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized $21.0 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2006. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), prior periods have not been restated. The Companys results of operations for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 include expenses believed to be of a one time or short term nature associated with the mergers, which included $6.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, considered in operating earnings and $7.5 million included in fiscal 2005 in interest expenses. The $6.8 million and $13.6 million included $1.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in charges associated with assets of the Company considered to be impaired as a result of the mergers and $4.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in costs associated with integrating the operations of Historical GameStop and EB. Costs related to the mergers included in interest expense in fiscal 2005 include a fee of $7.1 million for an unused bridge financing facility which the Company obtained as financing insurance in connection with the mergers. The Company does not anticipate incurring any additional merger related expenses. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $5.1 million in fiscal 2005 to $11.3 million in fiscal 2006 due to interest earned on invested assets. Interest expense increased from $30.4 million in fiscal 2005 to $84.7 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to the first full year of interest incurred on the senior notes payable and the senior floating rate notes payable and the interest incurred on the note payable to Barnes & Noble in connection with the repurchase of Historical GameStops Class B common stock in fiscal 2004. Debt extinguishment expense of $6.1 million was incurred in fiscal 2006 for the loss associated with the Companys repurchase of $50.0 million of its senior notes payable and $50.0 million of its senior floating rate notes payable. 35 Table of Contents Income tax expense increased by $36.9 million, from $59.1 million in fiscal 2005 to $96.0 million in fiscal 2006. The Companys effective tax rate increased from 37.0% in fiscal 2005 to 37.8% in fiscal 2006 due to corporate restructuring. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $141.0 million, or 73.2%, from $192.7 million in fiscal 2005 to $333.7 million in fiscal 2006 and an increase in net earnings of $57.5 million, or 57.0%, from $100.8 million in fiscal 2005 to $158.3 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Sales increased by $1,249.0 million, or 67.8%, from $1,842.8 million in fiscal 2004 to $3,091.8 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to approximately $996.8 million in sales from EB for the 16 weeks of its operations owned by the Company, approximately $216.0 million in non comparable store sales resulting from the 574 net new GameStop stores opened since January 31, 2004 and approximately $29.6 million due to an increase in comparable Historical GameStop store sales of 1.7%. This comparable store sales increase was expected due to the launch of Sony PlayStation Portable in March 2005 and the launch of Microsoft Xbox 360 hardware in November 2005. On a pro forma basis, comparable store sales decreased 1.4% in fiscal 2005. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation. The mergers and the release of the Sony PSP and the Microsoft Xbox 360 led to an increase in new video game hardware sales of $294.0 million, or 140.5%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. New hardware sales increased as a percentage of sales from 11.4% in fiscal 2004 to 16.3% in fiscal 2005 due primarily to the Sony PSP and Microsoft Xbox 360 launches. The mergers led to an increase in new video game software sales of $468.2 million, or 60.3%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. New software sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 42.1% in fiscal 2004 to 40.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the increase in new hardware sales as a percentage of total sales. Used video game product sales also grew due to an increase in store count, efforts to increase the supply of used inventory available for sale and the mergers, with an increase in sales of $296.2 million, or 57.9%, from fiscal 2004. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and character related merchandise, grew 55.2%, or $190.6 million, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, due to the mergers. Cost of sales increased by $886.3 million, or 66.5%, from $1,333.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $2,219.8 million in fiscal 2005 as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $362.7 million, or 71.2%, from $509.3 million in fiscal 2004 to $872.0 million in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 27.6% in fiscal 2004 to 28.2% in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of increases in vendor allowances received in excess of advertising expenses, which are recorded as a reduction in cost of sales. In fiscal 2005, vendor allowances received in excess of advertising expenses were $74.7 million compared to $29.9 million in fiscal 2004. This increase was due to the ownership of EB during the fourth fiscal quarter, during which much of the years advertising allowances are generated, and due to the launch of the Xbox 360, which generated additional advertising allowances. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new hardware, new software and other products increased due to the increase in vendor allowances received as discussed above. The gross profit on new hardware increased from 4.1% of sales in fiscal 2004 to 6.1% in fiscal 2005. Because new hardware platforms typically have lower margins than established hardware platforms, as expected, the launch of the Sony PSP and the Microsoft Xbox 360 had an offsetting effect on new hardware gross profit as a percentage of sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new software increased from 19.6% in fiscal 2004 to 21.4% in fiscal 2005 due to the increase in vendor allowances received, as discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products increased from 34.0% in fiscal 2004 to 35.8% in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products increased from 45.3% in fiscal 2004 to 47.4% in fiscal 2005 due to increased efforts to monitor margin rates and, following the mergers, the application of GameStops merchandising algorithms to EBs used video game category. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $225.9 million, or 60.5%, from $373.4 million in fiscal 2004 to $599.3 million in fiscal 2005. Approximately $165.9 million of this increase was attributable to the mergers and the remainder was due to increases in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution, and corporate office operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a 36 Table of Contents percentage of sales decreased from 20.2% in fiscal 2004 to 19.4% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to combining the full year results of Historical GameStops operations with the 16 weeks of EBs operations, including the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year typically experiences high leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses due to the holiday selling season. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $2.6 million in fiscal 2005, compared to an immaterial amount of loss in fiscal 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $36.8 million in fiscal 2004 to $66.4 million in fiscal 2005. This increase of $29.6 million was due primarily to depreciation of EBs assets of $22.4 million after the mergers, with the remaining increase due to capital expenditures for 296 new GameStop stores and management information systems and the commencement in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 of full operations in the Companys new distribution facility. The Companys results of operations for fiscal 2005 include expenses believed to be of a one time or short term nature associated with the mergers, which included $13.6 million included in operating earnings and $7.5 million included in interest expenses. The $13.6 million included $9.0 million in one time charges associated with assets of the Company considered to be impaired because they were redundant as a result of the mergers. The $7.5 million of merger related interest expense resulted primarily from a commitment fee of $7.1 million for bridge financing as a contingency in the event that we were unable to issue the senior notes and senior floating rate notes prior to the consummation of the mergers. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $1.9 million in fiscal 2004 to $5.1 million in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in the average yield on the investments, interest of $0.8 million earned on the investment of the $941.5 million in proceeds of the offering of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes from the issuance date on September 28, 2005 until the date of the mergers on October 8, 2005 and interest income earned by EB after the mergers on its invested assets. Interest expense increased from $2.2 million in fiscal 2004 to $30.4 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the interest incurred on the $650 million senior notes payable and the $300 million senior floating rate notes payable and the interest incurred on the note payable to Barnes & Noble in connection with the repurchase of Historical GameStops Class B common stock in fiscal 2004. Income tax expense increased by $21.1 million, from $38.0 million in fiscal 2004 to $59.1 million in fiscal 2005. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 38.4% in fiscal 2004 to 37.0% in fiscal 2005 due to expenses related to the mergers and corporate restructuring. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $93.6 million, from $99.1 million in fiscal 2004 to $192.7 million in fiscal 2005 and an increase in net earnings of $39.9 million, or 65.5%, from $60.9 million in fiscal 2004 to $100.8 million in fiscal 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources During fiscal 2006, cash provided by operations was $423.5 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $291.4 million in fiscal 2005 and cash provided by operations of $146.0 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in cash provided by operations of $132.1 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 resulted from an increase in net income of $57.5 million, primarily due to the addition of EBs results of operations since the mergers and the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006; an increase in depreciation and amortization of $43.5 million due primarily to the mergers; an increase in the growth in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net of growth in merchandise inventories and the provision for inventory reserves of $47.9 million caused by growth of the Company and efforts to manage working capital; an increase in the cash provided by prepaid taxes of $43.6 million offset by the change in the effect of the tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options of $56.0 million; and an increase in the non cash adjustment for stock based compensation expense due to the implementation of FAS 123(R) in fiscal 2006 of $20.6 million, all of which were offset by a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $41.0 million due primarily to the store growth and the timing of rent payments at the end of the fiscal 2006. 37 Table of Contents The cash provided by operations during fiscal 2005 was $291.4 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $146.0 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in cash provided by operations of $145.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 resulted from an increase in net income of $39.9 million, primarily due to EBs results of operations since the mergers; an increase in depreciation and amortization of $29.7 million due primarily to the mergers; an increase in the growth in accounts payable, net of growth in merchandise inventories, of $26.8 million caused by growth of the Company and efforts to manage working capital; an increase in the growth of accrued liabilities of $29.9 million due primarily to increases in liabilities for customer reservations caused by the growth of the Company; and a net decrease in prepaid expenses of $19.5 million due primarily to the timing of rent payments at the end of the fiscal 2004. Cash used in investing activities was $125.9 million and $996.8 million during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. During fiscal 2006, $133.9 million of capital expenditures were primarily used to invest in information and distribution systems in support of the integration of the operations of EB and Historical GameStop, to open new stores in the United States and for international expansion. Also, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company purchased Game Brands Inc., a 72 store video game retailer, for $11.3 million. These investing activities were offset by $19.3 million of cash provided by the sale of the Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center which were acquired in the mergers. During fiscal 2005, $886.1 million of cash was used to acquire EB. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 also included approximately $9.7 million to complete the build out of our new corporate headquarters and distribution center facility in Grapevine, Texas. The remaining $101.0 million in capital expenditures was used to open new stores, remodel existing stores and invest in information and distribution systems in support of the integration of the operations of EB and Historical GameStop. During fiscal 2004, our capital expenditures included approximately $27.7 million to acquire and begin the build out of our new corporate headquarters and distribution center facility. The remaining $70.6 million in capital expenditures was used to open new stores, remodel existing stores and invest in information systems. Cash used in financing activities was $46.7 million during fiscal 2006. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $935.7 million during fiscal 2005. The cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the repurchase of $50.0 million and $50.0 million of principal value of the Companys Senior Notes and Senior Floating Rate Notes, respectively, and the repayment of long term debt, including the payoff of the $9.2 million mortgage associated with the Pennsylvania distribution center sold in June 2006 and the $12.2 million principal payment in October 2006 on the Barnes & Noble promissory note. These decreases in cash flows were offset by $33.9 million received for the issuance of shares relating to stock option exercises and $43.7 million for the realization of tax benefits relating to the stock option exercises. The increase in cash flows for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the issuance of the Senior Notes and the Senior Floating Rate Notes in connection with the mergers. Our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened 421 stores in fiscal 2006 and expect to open approximately 500 to 550 stores in fiscal 2007. Within the next 12 to 18 months, we intend to rebrand all of the EB stores to the GameStop brand. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are projected to be approximately $135.0 million to $145.0 million, to be used primarily to fund new store openings, rebrand EB stores and invest in distribution and information systems in support of operations. In October 2005, in connection with the mergers, the Company entered into a five year, $400 million Credit Agreement (the Revolver), including a $50 million letter of credit sub limit, secured by the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and the borrower subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (x) approximately 70% of eligible inventory and (y) 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 85% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Companys ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options, and repurchase shares is generally prohibited, except that if availability under the Revolver is or will be after any such payment equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base the Company may repurchase its capital stock and pay cash dividends. In addition, in the event that credit extensions under the Revolver at any time exceed 80% of the 38 Table of Contents lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The interest rate on the Revolver is variable and, at the Companys option, is calculated by applying a margin of (1) 0.0% to 0.25% above the higher of the prime rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (2) 1.25% to 1.75% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. As of February 3, 2007, the applicable margin was 0.0% for prime rate loans and 1.50% for LIBO rate loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee, currently 0.375%, for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of February 3, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding totaled $4.3 million. On September 28, 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. (which was then a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Historical GameStop and is now, as a result of the mergers, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) as co issuer (together with the Company, the Issuers), completed the offering of U.S. $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes) and U.S. $650 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes and, together with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the Notes). The Notes were issued under an indenture (the Indenture), dated September 28, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). Concurrently with the consummation of the mergers on October 8, 2005, EB and its direct and indirect domestic wholly owned subsidiaries (together, the EB Guarantors) became subsidiaries of the Company and entered into a first supplemental indenture, dated October 8, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the EB Guarantors and the Trustee, pursuant to which the EB Guarantors assumed all the obligations of a subsidiary guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture. The net proceeds of the offering were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to the stockholders of EB in connection with the mergers. The Senior Floating Rate Notes bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.875%, mature on October 1, 2011 and were priced at 100%. The rate of interest on the Senior Floating Rate Notes as of February 3, 2007 was 9.235% per annum. The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, mature on October 1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a discount at the time of issue of $8.5 million. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest method. As of February 3, 2007, the unamortized original issue discount was $6.7 million. The Issuers pay interest on the Senior Floating Rate Notes quarterly, in arrears, every January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding December 15, March 15, June 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The Issuers pay interest on the Senior Notes semi annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limitations on (1) the incurrence of additional debt, (2) restricted payments, (3) liens, (4) sale and leaseback transactions and (5) asset sales. Events of default provided for in the Indenture include, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal on the Notes, other breaches of covenants in the Indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. As of February 3, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Revolver and the Indenture. The offering of the Notes was conducted in a private transaction under Rule 144A under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and in transactions outside the United States in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the closing of the offering, the Issuers also entered into a registration rights agreement, dated September 28, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors listed on Schedule I A thereto, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for themselves and as representatives of the several initial purchasers listed on Schedule II thereto (the Registration Rights Agreement). The Registration Rights Agreement required the Issuers to, among other things, (1) file a registration statement with the SEC to be used in connection with the exchange of the Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms, (2) use their reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 210 days from 39 Table of Contents the date the Notes were issued, and (3) use their commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the exchange offer with respect to the Notes within 270 days from the date the Notes were issued. In April 2006, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S 4 in order to register new notes (the New Notes) with the same terms and conditions as the Notes in order to facilitate an exchange of the New Notes for the Notes. This registration statement on Form S 4 was declared effective by the SEC on May 10, 2006 and the Company commenced an exchange offer to exchange the New Notes for the Notes. This exchange offer was completed in June 2006 with 100% participation. In November 2006, Citibank, N.A. resigned as Trustee for the Notes and Wilmington Trust Company was appointed as the new Trustee for the Notes. Under certain conditions, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions prior to maturity redeem up to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes and or Senior Notes issued under the Indenture at redemption prices at or in excess of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The circumstances which would limit the percentage of the Notes which may be redeemed or which would require the Company to pay a premium in excess of 100% of the principal amount are defined in the Indenture. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers are required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The Issuers may acquire Senior Floating Rate Notes and Senior Notes by means other than redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. In May 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes and Senior Notes. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had repurchased the maximum authorized amount, having acquired $50.0 million of its Senior Notes, and $50.0 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes and delivered the Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on retirement of debt is $6.1 million. Subsequently, on February 9, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of an additional $150.0 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes and Senior Notes. The timing and amount of the repurchases will be determined by the Companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions and other factors. In addition, the repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. At the time of filing, the Company had repurchased $14.9 million of its Senior Notes and $64.6 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes pursuant to this new authorization and delivered the Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on retirement of debt is $5.1 million. In October 2004, Historical GameStop issued a promissory note in favor of Barnes & Noble in the principal amount of $74.0 million in connection with the repurchase of Historical GameStops common shares held by Barnes & Noble. Payments of $37.5 million, $12.2 million and $12.2 million were made in January 2005, October 2005 and October 2006, respectively, as required by the promissory note, which also requires a final payment of $12.2 million in October 2007. The note is unsecured and bears interest at 5.5% per annum, payable when principal installments are due. On May 25, 2005, a subsidiary of EB closed on a 10 year, $9.5 million mortgage agreement collateralized by a new 315,000 square foot distribution facility located in Sadsbury Township, Pennsylvania. In June 2006, the outstanding principal balance under the mortgage of approximately $9.2 million was paid in full in conjunction with the sale of the distribution facility. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our operations, required interest payments on the Notes and our note payable to Barnes & Noble, store expansion and remodeling activities and corporate capital expenditure programs for at least the next 12 months. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations (in millions) as of February 3, 2007: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 1,242.8 $ 83.7 $ 142.6 $ 384.5 $ 632.0 Operating Leases $ 858.8 $ 219.0 $ 333.1 $ 169.7 $ 137.0 Purchase Obligations(2) $ 626.0 $ 626.0 $ $ $ Involuntary Employment Termination Costs(3) $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ $ $ Total $ 2,728.8 $ 929.9 $ 475.7 $ 554.2 $ 769.0 (1) The long term debt consists of $600.0 million (principal value), which bears interest at 8.0%, $250.0 million of floating rate notes which bore interest at 9.235% as of February 3, 2007 and $12.2 million which bears interest at 5.5%. Amounts include contractual interest payments (using the interest rate as of February 3, 2007 for the floating rate notes). (2) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. (3) Involuntary employment termination costs include known, remaining amounts committed to former employees, primarily in general and administrative functions in EBs Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center and Nevada call center, which were closed in the first half of fiscal 2006. In addition to minimum rentals, the operating leases generally require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs and may provide for percentage rentals. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term, including renewal options for those leases in which it is reasonably assured that the Company will exercise the renewal option. The Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding. The Company has entered into employment agreements with R. Richard Fontaine, Daniel A. DeMatteo, Steven R. Morgan and David W. Carlson. The terms of the employment agreement for Mr. Fontaine and Mr. DeMatteo commenced on April 11, 2005 and continue for a period of three years thereafter, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Morgan commenced on December 9, 2005 and continues through February 12, 2008, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Carlson commenced on April 3, 2006 and continues for a period of two years thereafter, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. Mr. Fontaines minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $650,000. Mr. DeMatteos minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $535,000. Mr. Morgans minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $450,000. Mr. Carlsons minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $350,000. The Board of Directors of the Company has set Mr. Fontaines, Mr. DeMatteos, Mr. Morgans and Mr. Carlsons salaries for fiscal 2007 at $1,000,000, $800,000, $500,000 and $400,000, respectively. As of February 3, 2007, we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $4.3 million and had cash collateralized bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $4.1 million. The Company had no standby repurchase obligations outstanding as of February 3, 2007. 41 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company remains contingently liable for the BC Sports Collectibles store leases assigned to Sports Collectibles Acquisition Corporation (SCAC). SCAC is owned by the family of James J. Kim, Chairman of EB at the time and currently one of the Companys directors. If SCAC were to default on these lease obligations, the Company would be liable to the landlords for up to $0.1 million in minimum rent and landlord charges as of February 3, 2007. Mr. Kim has entered into an indemnification agreement with EB with respect to these leases, therefore no accrual was recorded for this contingent obligation. Impact of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions The Company operates departments within ten bookstores operated by Barnes & Noble. The Company pays a license fee to Barnes & Noble in amounts equal to 7.0% of the gross sales of such departments. Management deems the license fee to be reasonable and based upon terms equivalent to those that would prevail in an arms length transaction. During the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, these charges amounted to $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Until June 2005, Historical GameStop participated in Barnes & Nobles workers compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by Barnes & Noble under these programs were allocated to Historical GameStop based upon total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history of Historical GameStop. Management deemed the allocation methodology to be reasonable. Although Historical GameStop secured its own insurance coverage, costs will likely continue to be incurred by Barnes & Noble on insurance claims which were incurred under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against Historical GameStop will be allocated to the Company. During the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, these allocated charges amounted to $0.8 million, $1.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. In October 2004, the Board of Directors of Historical GameStop authorized a repurchase of Historical GameStop common stock held by Barnes & Noble. Historical GameStop repurchased 12,214,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to $9.13 per share for aggregate consideration before expenses of $111.5 million. The repurchase price per share was determined by using a discount of 3.5% on the last reported trade of Historical GameStops common stock on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the time of the transaction. Historical GameStop paid $37.5 million in cash and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $74.0 million, the remaining balance of which is payable in October 2007 and bears interest at 5.5% per annum, payable when the final payment is due. Scheduled principal payments of $37.5 million, $12.2 million and $12.2 million were made in January 2005, October 2005 and October 2006, respectively. Interest expense on the promissory note for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 totaled $1.1 million, $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively. In May 2005, we entered into an arrangement with Barnes & Noble under which www.gamestop.com is the exclusive specialty video game retailer listed on www.bn.com, Barnes & Nobles e commerce site. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company pays a fee to Barnes & Noble for sales of video game or PC entertainment products sold through www.bn.com. For the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, the fee to Barnes & Noble totaled $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. On November 2, 2002, EB sold its BC Sports Collectibles business to SCAC for cash and the assumption of lease related liabilities. The purchaser, SCAC, is owned by the family of James J. Kim, Chairman of EB at the time and currently one of the Companys directors. As EB remains contingently liable for the BC store leases, Mr. Kim has agreed to indemnify EB against any liabilities associated with these leases. 42 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. We were required to adopt FIN 48 effective February 4, 2007. The cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN 48 is to record an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The Company is evaluating the impact of implementing the provisions of FIN 48 on its financial position and future results of operations, but does not expect that the impact will be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB No. 108) in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. In SAB No. 108, the SEC staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the Companys financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company adopted of SAB No. 108 in fiscal 2006, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) ratified its conclusion on EITF No. 06 03, How Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)(EITF 06 03). The EITF concluded that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer such as sales, use, value added and certain excise taxes, is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed in a companys financial statements. Additionally, companies that record such taxes on a gross basis should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant. EITF 06 03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company presents such taxes on a net basis for all periods presented. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Companies should report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on its consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. 43 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term, highly liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. In addition, the Notes issued in connection with the mergers include both fixed rate and floating rate notes with the intent to minimize exposure to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical increase (or decrease) of 10% of the effective rate on the floating rate notes would result in a change in the annual interest expense of $2.3 million. The effective rate on the floating rate notes was 9.2350% on February 3, 2007. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances, and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest. Foreign Currency Risk The mergers significantly increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations because a larger amount of our business is now transacted in foreign currencies. While Historical GameStop generally did not enter into derivative instruments with respect to foreign currency risks, EB routinely used forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to manage currency risk and had a number of open positions designated as hedge transactions as of the merger date. The Company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for all derivative instruments acquired in connection with the mergers. The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 133) as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, depending on the type of hedge transaction. The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps, (together, the Foreign Currency Contracts) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. The aggregate fair value of the Foreign Currency Contracts at February 3, 2007 was a liability of $1.9 million. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the Foreign Currency Contracts from the market rate at February 3, 2007 would result in a gain or (loss) in value of the forwards and swaps of $1.8 million or ($1.5 million), respectively. The Company had no Foreign Currency Contracts prior to October 8, 2005.
