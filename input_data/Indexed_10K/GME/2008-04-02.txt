Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, managements plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. General GameStop Corp. (GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company) is the worlds largest retailer of video game products and PC entertainment software. We sell new and used video game hardware, video game software and accessories, as well as PC entertainment software and related accessories and other merchandise. As of February 2, 2008, we operated 5,264 stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, primarily under the names GameStop and EB Games. We also operate electronic commerce websites under the names www.gamestop.com and www.ebgames.com and publish Game Informer, the industrys largest multi platform video game magazine in the United States based on circulation. 25 Table of Contents Our fiscal year is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended February 2, 2008 (fiscal 2007) and January 28, 2006 (fiscal 2005) consisted of 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 (fiscal 2006) consisted of 53 weeks. On October 8, 2005, GameStop Holdings Corp. (Historical GameStop), formerly known as GameStop Corp., and Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. (EB or Electronics Boutique) completed their previously announced mergers pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 17, 2005 (the Merger Agreement). Upon the consummation of the mergers, Historical GameStop and EB became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of consummating the business combination (the mergers). The mergers of Historical GameStop and EB have been treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, with Historical GameStop designated as the acquirer. Therefore, the historical financial statements of Historical GameStop became the historical financial statements of the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto include the results of operations of EB from October 9, 2005 forward. Therefore, the Companys operating results for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 include 16 weeks of EBs results and 52 weeks, respectively, of Historical GameStops results. The Companys operating results for the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 include 52 weeks and 53 weeks, respectively, for both Historical GameStop and EB. As a result, sales mix, cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization and interest expense in fiscal 2006 were significantly impacted by including the operations of EB for a full year, as opposed to 16 weeks in fiscal 2005, which included the holiday selling season. Growth in each of these statement of operations line items came from each of the Companys business segments. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Historical GameStops stockholders received one share of the Companys common stock for each share of Historical GameStops common stock owned. Approximately 104.2 million shares of the Companys common stock were issued in exchange for all outstanding common stock of Historical GameStop based on the one for one ratio. EB stockholders received $19.08 in cash and .39398 of a share of the Companys common stock for each share of EB common stock owned. In aggregate, 40.5 million shares of the Companys common stock were issued to EB stockholders at a value of approximately $437.1 million (based on the closing price of $10.81 of Historical GameStops common stock on April 15, 2005, the last trading day before the date the mergers were announced). In addition, approximately $993.3 million in cash was paid in consideration for (i) all outstanding common stock of EB, based upon the pro ration provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) all outstanding stock options of EB. Including transaction costs of $13.6 million, the total consideration paid was approximately $1.4 billion. On February 7, 2007, following approval by a majority of the Class B common stockholders in a special meeting of the Companys Class B common stockholders, all outstanding Class B common shares were converted into Class A common shares on a one for one basis. In addition, on February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a two for one stock split, effected by a one for one stock dividend to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007, paid on March 16, 2007 (the Stock Split). Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been restated to reflect the conversion and the Stock Split. Growth in the video game industry is driven by the introduction of new technology. In March of fiscal 2005 in the North American markets and September of fiscal 2005 in the Australian and European markets, Sony introduced the PlayStation Portable (the PSP) and Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 in November of fiscal 2005 in North America and Europe and the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in Australia. In November 2006, Nintendo introduced the Wii hardware platform worldwide and Sony introduced the PlayStation 3 hardware platform in the North American markets. Sony introduced the PlayStation 3 platform in the Australian and European markets in March 2007. Typically, in the first full year following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware increase as a percentage of sales. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the second and third years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the second and third years. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price decreases, further driving sales of related software and accessories. We expect that the installed base of the hardware platforms listed above and sales of 26 Table of Contents related software and accessories will increase in the future. The Companys gross margin in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by the recent launches of these new products and subsequent manufacturer funded retail price decreases for some of these products. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events: Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the Companys financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time of sale. The sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Sales returns (which are not significant) are recognized at the time returns are made. Subscription and advertising revenues are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers and are stated net of sales discounts. Magazine subscription revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period. Gift cards sold to customers are recognized as a liability on the balance sheet until redeemed. Stock Based Compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)). This Statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees in its financial statements. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method beginning on the first day of fiscal 2006. Under SFAS 123(R), the Company records stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures, for all options granted prior to, but not vested as of, the adoption date. In addition, the Company records compensation expense for the share based awards issued after the adoption date in accordance with SFAS 123(R). As of February 2, 2008, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options and restricted stock was $13.7 million and $18.8 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8 and 1.9 years, respectively. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information on stock based compensation. Merchandise Inventories. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on hand and this amount is re averaged over the cumulative units. Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with inventory markdowns. We also adjust inventory based on anticipated physical inventory losses or shrinkage. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the reported inventory is accurate. During interim periods, estimates of shrinkage are recorded based on historical losses in the context of current period circumstances. 27 Table of Contents Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives (ranging from two to eight years). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including renewal options in which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred to third parties in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational. The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including managements intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected cash flows. As a result of the mergers and an analysis of assets to be abandoned, the Company impaired assets totaling $9.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $1.9 million in fiscal 2006 prior to October 8, 2006, the anniversary of the mergers. These impairment costs are included in merger related expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Write downs incurred by the Company through February 2, 2008 which were not related to the mergers have not been material. Merger Related Costs. In connection with the mergers, management incurred merger related costs and integration expenses of approximately $6.8 million and $21.1 million, which were charged to costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. The Company completed all integration activities in fiscal 2006. Rebranding of EB stores to the GameStop name is substantially complete. Goodwill. Goodwill, aggregating $340.0 million, was recorded in the acquisition of Funco in 2000 and through the application of push down accounting in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 54 (SAB 54) in connection with the acquisition of Babbages, Etc. LLC in 1999 by a subsidiary of Barnes Noble, Inc. (Barnes Noble). Goodwill in the amount of $2.9 million was recorded in connection with the acquisition of Gamesworld Group Limited in 2003. Goodwill in the amount of $1,074.9 million was recorded in connection with the mergers. Goodwill in the amount of $6.6 million was recorded in connection with the acquisition in January 2007 of Game Brands Inc. (operating as Rhino Video Games stores). Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Subsequent to the mergers, the Company determined that it has four reporting units, the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations and separate management within those regions. The Company employed the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of goodwill resulting from the mergers to the four reporting units as of October 8, 2005. The Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information concerning goodwill. Intangible Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets. Intangible assets consist of point of sale software and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests acquired in the mergers and are included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is approximately four years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized, with no expected residual value. The deferred financing fees associated with the Companys revolving credit facility and the senior notes issued in connection with the financing of the mergers are separately shown in the consolidated balance sheet. 28 Table of Contents The deferred financing fees are being amortized over five and seven years to match the terms of the revolving credit facility and the senior notes, respectively. Deferred financing fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the senior floating rate notes were included in deferred financing fees in the balance sheet and were being amortized over six years to match the term of the senior floating rate notes. The remaining balance of the deferred financing fees on the senior floating rate notes was written off to debt extinguishment expense during fiscal 2007 when the notes were redeemed. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors. The Company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs, in accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02 16, results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The Company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year, the Company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods, including estimates of full year vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory. Estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases. Determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known. Although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances. In addition, management believes that the Companys revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances, but management is unable to quantify the impact. Lease Accounting. The Companys method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability) and leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) is in conformance with GAAP, as clarified by the Chief Accountant of the SEC in a February 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which we are reasonably assured of exercising lease options and we include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed, or rent holiday. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 utilizes an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. We generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. 29 Table of Contents In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized under SFAS 109. FIN 48 addresses the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The Company adopted and applied FIN 48 under the transition provisions to all of its income tax positions at the required effective date of February 4, 2007, resulting in a $16.7 million cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings and a $7.9 million increase in prepaid taxes. For additional information related to the Companys adoption of FIN 48, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain income statement items as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 Statement of Operations Data: Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 74.4 72.3 71.8 Gross profit 25.6 27.7 28.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.7 19.2 19.4 Depreciation and amortization 1.8 2.1 2.2 Merger related expenses 0.1 0.4 Operating earnings 7.1 6.3 6.2 Interest expense, net 0.7 1.4 0.8 Merger related interest expense 0.2 Debt extinguishment expense 0.2 0.1 Earnings before income taxes 6.2 4.8 5.2 Income tax expense 2.1 1.8 1.9 Net earnings 4.1 % 3.0 % 3.3 % The Company includes purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, rather than cost of goods sold, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, these purchasing, receiving and distribution costs amounted to $43.9 million, $35.9 million and $20.8 million, respectively. The Company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales, rather than selling, general and administrative expenses, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, these processing fees amounted to $55.2 million, $40.9 million and $20.9 million, respectively. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net effect of the Companys classifications is that its cost of sales as a percentage of sales is higher than, and its selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are lower than, they would have been had the Companys treatment conformed with those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses, by 0.2%, 0.1% and 0.0% for the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. 30 Table of Contents The following table sets forth sales (in millions) by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks 53 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 Percent Percent Percent Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales: New video game hardware $ 1,668.9 23.5 % $ 1,073.7 20.2 % $ 503.2 16.3 % New video game software 2,800.7 39.5 % 2,012.5 37.8 % 1,244.9 40.3 % Used video game products 1,586.7 22.4 % 1,316.0 24.8 % 808.0 26.1 % Other 1,037.7 14.6 % 916.7 17.2 % 535.7 17.3 % Total $ 7,094.0 100.0 % $ 5,318.9 100.0 % $ 3,091.8 100.0 % Other products include PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and character related merchandise. The following table sets forth gross profit (in millions) and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks 53 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 Gross Gross Gross Gross Profit Gross Profit Gross Profit Profit Percent Profit Percent Profit Percent Gross Profit: New video game hardware $ 108.2 6.5 % $ 77.0 7.2 % $ 30.9 6.1 % New video game software 581.7 20.8 % 427.3 21.2 % 266.5 21.4 % Used video game products 772.2 48.7 % 651.9 49.5 % 383.0 47.4 % Other 351.6 33.9 % 315.2 34.4 % 191.6 35.8 % Total $ 1,813.7 25.6 % $ 1,471.4 27.7 % $ 872.0 28.2 % Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Sales increased by $1,775.1 million, or 33.4%, to $7,094.0 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007 compared to $5,318.9 million in the 53 weeks of fiscal 2006. The increase in sales was attributable to the comparable store sales increase of 24.7% for fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006, the addition of non comparable store sales from the 1,007 stores opened since January 29, 2006 of approximately $496.2 million and increases related to changes in foreign exchange rates of $109.4 million, offset by sales of $99.1 million for the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006. The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong sales of the Nintendo Wii, Microsofts Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation 3, which completed its worldwide launch during this fiscal year, and their related software and accessories, including several strong video game titles, such as Halo 3 and Guitar Hero III. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation. The comparable store sales increase of 24.7% was calculated by using the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007 compared to the most closely comparable 52 weeks of fiscal 2006 with consideration given to the timing of holidays to ensure comparability. New video game hardware sales increased $595.2 million or 55.4%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the sales of hardware units mentioned above, as well as the increase in store count since January 2007, offset by the 53rd week of sales included in fiscal 2006. New video game hardware sales increased as a percentage of sales from 20.2% in fiscal 2006 to 23.5% in fiscal 2007, primarily due to the first full year since the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 launch as well as increasing sales of Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DS. 31 Table of Contents New video game software sales increased $788.2 million, or 39.2%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to new stores added in fiscal 2007, sales related to the new hardware platforms and a strong lineup of new video game titles released during the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. New video game software sales as a percentage of total sales increased from 37.8% in fiscal 2006 to 39.5% in fiscal 2007 due to increased sales related to the new hardware platforms and the availability of several strong titles in fiscal 2007. Used video game product sales increased $270.7 million, or 20.6%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the increase in new store count, an increase in overall demand for video game products following the launch of new hardware platforms and the strong growth of used video game product sales internationally, offset by the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of sales, used video game product sales decreased from 24.8% to 22.4% primarily due to the strong sales of new video game hardware and software. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and trading cards, grew 13.2%, or $121.0 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the increase in store count and the increase in new hardware platform accessories sales, offset by the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. Cost of sales increased by $1,432.8 million, or 37.2%, from $3,847.5 million in fiscal 2006 to $5,280.3 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the increase in sales and the changes in gross profit discussed below, offset by the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. Gross profit increased by $342.3 million, or 23.3%, from $1,471.4 million in fiscal 2006 to $1,813.7 million in fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.7% in fiscal 2006 to 25.6% in fiscal 2007. The gross profit percentage decrease was caused primarily by the increase in sales of new video game hardware as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2007. New video game hardware typically carries a much lower margin than sales in the other product categories. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was also impacted by a decrease in the excess of vendor allowances received over marketing and advertising expenses. Vendor allowances received during fiscal 2006 were abnormally high due to the launches of the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 and returned to normal levels in fiscal 2007. In addition, net vendor allowances decreased due to higher expenditures on marketing and advertising from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 in support of the Companys branding campaign. These factors led to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware, new video game software and other products from 7.2%, 21.2% and 34.4% of sales, respectively, in fiscal 2006 to 6.5%, 20.8% and 33.9% of sales, respectively, in fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products decreased from 49.5% in fiscal 2006 to 48.7% in fiscal 2007 due to increased promotional expenses and higher refurbishment costs associated with an increase in production of refurbished hardware platforms during fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $160.9 million, or 15.8%, from $1,021.1 million in fiscal 2006 to $1,182.0 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses, offset by expenses from the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 19.2% in fiscal 2006 to 16.7% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leveraging as a result of the higher sales associated with the introduction of the new video game systems and synergies associated with the acquisition of EB. Selling, general and administrative expenses include $26.9 and $21.0 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $8.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to ($1.0) million in fiscal 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $109.9 million in fiscal 2006 to $130.3 million in fiscal 2007. This increase of $20.4 million was due primarily to capital expenditures for 586 new GameStop stores. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 due to continued capital expenditures for new stores and management information systems. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $11.3 million in fiscal 2006 to $13.8 million in fiscal 2007 due to interest earned on invested assets. Interest expense decreased from $84.7 million in fiscal 2006 to $61.6 million in fiscal 2007, primarily due to the retirement of $20.0 million of the Companys senior notes and $250.0 million of the Companys senior floating rate notes since February 3, 2007. Debt extinguishment expense of $12.6 million was recognized in fiscal 2007 as a result of the premiums paid related 32 Table of Contents to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Debt extinguishment expense of $6.1 million was incurred in fiscal 2006 for the loss associated with the Companys repurchase of $50.0 million of its senior notes payable and $50.0 million of its senior floating rate notes payable. Income tax expense increased by $56.8 million, from $96.0 million in fiscal 2006 to $152.8 million in fiscal 2007. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 37.8% in fiscal 2006 to 34.6% in fiscal 2007 due to the release of foreign valuation allowances on net operating losses and the recognition of foreign tax credits not previously benefited. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $167.7 million, or 50.3%, from $333.7 million in fiscal 2006 to $501.4 million in fiscal 2007 and an increase in net earnings of $130.0 million, or 82.1%, from $158.3 million in fiscal 2006 to $288.3 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Sales increased by $2,227.1 million, or 72.0%, to $5,318.9 million in the 53 weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to $3,091.8 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2005. Sales for the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006 were $99.1 million. The remaining increase in sales was attributable to approximately $1,408.4 million of sales in EB stores in fiscal 2006 prior to the anniversary of the mergers, approximately $247.1 million in non comparable store sales resulting from the approximately 800 new GameStop stores opened since January 29, 2005, with the remaining increase of $472.5 million due primarily to an increase in comparable store sales. The comparable store sales increase was 11.9% on a pro forma basis for fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 and was expected due to the launch of the Sony PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii in November 2006. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation. The pro forma comparable store sales increase of 11.9% was calculated by using the first 52 weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to the 52 weeks in fiscal 2005. New video game hardware sales increased $570.5 million or 113.4%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the mergers, the 53rd week of sales included in fiscal 2006 and the launches of Microsoft Xbox 360 in November 2005 and the Sony Playstation 3 and the Nintendo Wii in November 2006. New hardware sales increased as a percentage of sales from 16.3% in fiscal 2005 to 20.2% in fiscal 2006 due primarily to the first full year since the Microsoft Xbox 360 launch and due to the launches of the new platforms in 2006. New video game software sales also increased $767.6 million, or 61.7%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the mergers, the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006 and a strong lineup of new video game titles. New software sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 40.3% in fiscal 2005 to 37.8% in fiscal 2006 due to the increase in new hardware sales as a percentage of total sales. Used video game product sales also grew due to the mergers, the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006 and the increase in store count, with an increase in sales of $508.0 million, or 62.9%, from fiscal 2005. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and trading cards, grew 71.1%, or $381.0 million, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the mergers and the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. Cost of sales increased by $1,627.7 million, or 73.3%, from $2,219.8 million in fiscal 2005 to $3,847.5 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of the mergers, the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006 and the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $599.4 million, or 68.7%, from $872.0 million in fiscal 2005 to $1,471.4 million in fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from 28.2% in fiscal 2005 to 27.7% in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in hardware sales as a percentage of total sales. New hardware sales carry a lower overall gross profit compared to other sales categories. The increase in hardware sales was driven by new product launches in fiscal 2006. The gross profit on new hardware increased from 6.1% of sales in fiscal 2005 to 7.2% in fiscal 2006 due to an emphasis on selling product replacement plans along with hardware platforms. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new software remained comparable at 21.4% in fiscal 2005 and 21.2% in fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products decreased from 35.8% in fiscal 2005 to 34.4% in fiscal 2006 due to a shift in sales to lower margin products within the other product categories. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products increased from 47.4% in fiscal 2005 to 49.5% in fiscal 2006 due to increased 33 Table of Contents efforts to monitor margin rates and the application of GameStops merchandising algorithms to EBs used video game category for all of fiscal 2006 compared to only the period following the mergers in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $421.8 million, or 70.4%, from $599.3 million in fiscal 2005 to $1,021.1 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the mergers, the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses as well as expenses from the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 19.4% in fiscal 2005 to 19.2% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to synergies obtained from the mergers, including the shut down of EBs corporate headquarters and distribution center. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to ($1.0) million in fiscal 2006, compared to $2.6 million in fiscal 2005. These amounts were offset by the changes related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) discussed below. Beginning January 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective application method. Under this method, the Company records stock based compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures for all options granted prior to, but not vested as of, the adoption date. In addition, the Company records compensation expense for the share based awards granted after the adoption date in accordance with SFAS 123(R). As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized $21.0 million of stock based compensation expense in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), prior periods have not been restated. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $66.4 million in fiscal 2005 to $109.9 million in fiscal 2006. This increase of $43.5 million was due primarily to the mergers, with the remaining increase due to capital expenditures for 421 new GameStop stores and the Companys new corporate headquarters and distribution facility. The Companys results of operations for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 include expenses believed to be of a one time or short term nature associated with the mergers, which included $6.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, considered in operating earnings and $7.5 million included in fiscal 2005 in interest expense. The $6.8 million and $13.6 million included $1.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in charges associated with assets of the Company considered to be impaired as a result of the mergers and $4.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in costs associated with integrating the operations of Historical GameStop and EB. Costs related to the mergers included in interest expense in fiscal 2005 include a fee of $7.1 million for an unused bridge financing facility which the Company obtained as financing insurance in connection with the mergers. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $5.1 million in fiscal 2005 to $11.3 million in fiscal 2006 due to interest earned on invested assets. Interest expense increased from $30.4 million in fiscal 2005 to $84.7 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to the first full year of interest incurred on the senior notes payable and the senior floating rate notes payable and the interest incurred on the note payable to Barnes Noble in connection with the repurchase of Historical GameStops Class B common stock in fiscal 2004. Debt extinguishment expense of $6.1 million was incurred in fiscal 2006 for the loss associated with the Companys repurchase of $50.0 million of its senior notes payable and $50.0 million of its senior floating rate notes payable. Income tax expense increased by $36.9 million, from $59.1 million in fiscal 2005 to $96.0 million in fiscal 2006. The Companys effective tax rate increased from 37.0% in fiscal 2005 to 37.8% in fiscal 2006 due to corporate restructuring. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $141.0 million, or 73.2%, from $192.7 million in fiscal 2005 to $333.7 million in fiscal 2006 and an increase in net earnings of $57.5 million, or 57.0%, from $100.8 million in fiscal 2005 to $158.3 million in fiscal 2006. Segment Information The Company operates its business in the following segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance and the division of management responsibility. Each of the segments consists primarily of retail 34 Table of Contents operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and used video game systems, software and accessories which we refer to as video game products and PC entertainment software and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products in the various segments. Stores in all segments are similar in size at an average of approximately 1,500 square feet each. As we have expanded our presence in international markets, the Company has increased its operations in foreign currencies, including the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, and the Norwegian kroner. The notes issued in connection with the mergers are reflected in the United States segment. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Sales by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): 52 Weeks 53 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 5,438.8 $ 4,269.5 $ 2,709.8 Canada 473.0 319.7 111.4 Australia 420.8 288.1 94.4 Europe 761.4 441.6 176.2 Total $ 7,094.0 $ 5,318.9 $ 3,091.8 Operating earnings by operating segment, defined as income from continuing operations before intercompany royalty fees, net interest expense and income taxes, in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): 52 Weeks 53 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 391.2 $ 285.4 $ 173.7 Canada 35.8 20.0 7.9 Australia 41.8 27.3 11.0 Europe 32.6 1.0 0.1 Total $ 501.4 $ 333.7 $ 192.7 Total assets by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): February 2, February 3, January 28, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 2,742.0 $ 2,618.9 $ 2,347.8 Canada 274.7 210.4 210.4 Australia 251.1 210.7 214.7 Europe 508.1 309.6 242.9 Total $ 3,775.9 $ 3,349.6 $ 3,015.8 Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 United States Segment results for the United States include retail operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam, the electronic commerce websites www.gamestop.com and www.ebgames.com and Game Informer magazine. As of February 2, 2008, the United States segment included 4,061 GameStop stores, compared to 3,799 stores on February 3, 2007, and 3,624 stores on January 28, 2006. Sales for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased 27.4% compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 as a result of increased sales at existing 35 Table of Contents stores and the opening of 604 new stores since January 28, 2006, including 328 stores in the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. Sales at existing stores increased due to strong sales of new hardware platform units, including the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 and their related software and accessories, as well as Microsofts Xbox 360 hardware, software and accessories, particularly new sales of Halo 3 and Guitar Hero III released during fiscal 2007. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased by 37.1% compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007, driven by strong sales of the new hardware platforms and their related software and accessories, leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses, and the recognition of synergies related to the acquisition of EB, including the shut down in fiscal 2006 of EBs corporate headquarters and distribution center. Canada Sales in the Canadian segment in the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased 48.0% compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to increased sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 28 stores opened since January 28, 2006. As of February 2, 2008, the Canadian segment had 287 stores compared to 267 stores as of February 3, 2007. The increase in sales at existing stores was driven by strong sales of the new hardware platform units, including the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 and their related software and accessories, as well as Microsofts Xbox 360 hardware, software and accessories, particularly new software sales of Halo 3 and Guitar Hero III released in fiscal 2007. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased by 79.0% compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007, driven by the increased sales and the related margin dollars discussed above, the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates since the prior year. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, changes in exchange rates when compared to the prior year had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $1.9 million. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail operations in Australia and New Zealand. As of February 2, 2008, the Australian segment included 280 stores, compared to 219 as of February 3, 2007. Sales for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased 46.1% compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. The increase in sales was due to higher sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 104 stores opened since January 28, 2006. The increase in sales at existing stores was due to strong sales of the Sony PlayStation 3, which launched in Australia and New Zealand during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as well as strong sales of other video game hardware, including the Nintendo Wii, and increased sales of handheld video game systems during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increased hardware sales led to increases in sales in new video game software, used video game products and accessories and other products. Segment operating income in the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased by 53.1% when compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. The increase was driven by the increased sales and related margin dollars discussed above, the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates since the prior year. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, changes in exchange rates when compared to the prior year had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $3.7 million. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 12 European countries including Portugal, which commenced operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. As of February 2, 2008, the European segment operated 636 stores, compared to 493 stores as of February 3, 2007. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, European sales increased 72.4% compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. The increase in sales was primarily due to the increase in sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 271 stores opened since January 28, 2006. The increase in store count was offset by store closings in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, primarily in Spain, as part of the implementation of the integration strategy of the acquisition of EB. The increase in sales at existing stores was driven by strong sales of the Sony PlayStation 3, which launched in Europe during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as well as strong sales of other video game hardware, including the Nintendo Wii, and increased sales of Microsofts Xbox 360 and handheld video game systems during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increased hardware 36 Table of Contents sales led to increases in sales in new video game software, used video game products and accessories and other products. The segment operating income in Europe for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 increased to $32.6 million compared to $1.0 million in the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007. The increase in the operating income was driven by the increase in sales and related margin dollars discussed above, the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses, both of which reflect the continued maturation of our operations in the European market, and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates since the prior year. For the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, changes in exchange rates when compared to fiscal 2006 had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $2.7 million. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Segment results for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 include the first full year of sales and operating earnings for the 2,350 EB stores acquired in fiscal 2005. Segment results for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006 only include the results of operations of the EB stores from October 9, 2005 though January 28, 2006 due to the mergers and therefore is not comparable. Prior to the mergers, the Companys international operations only included Ireland and the United Kingdom which were not material. Having segment results for fiscal 2006 from Canada, Australia and Europe increased international segment sales and operating earnings as a percentage of total sales and operating earnings from 12.4% and 9.9%, respectively, in fiscal 2005 to 19.7% and 14.5%, respectively, in fiscal 2006. Management does not believe that a further comparison of international segment results for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 would be meaningful. Liquidity and Capital Resources During fiscal 2007, cash provided by operations was $502.7 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $423.5 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in cash provided by operations of $79.2 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 resulted from an increase in net income of $130.0 million, as previously discussed, as well as a net decrease in prepaid taxes and taxes payable of $61.8 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $21.1 million due primarily to new store growth. These increases in cash provided by operations were offset by an increase in merchandise inventories of $59.1 million primarily due to new store growth; the increase in the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards of $49.6 million; an increase in receivables of $24.6 million due primarily to an increase in sales and store growth and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $23.6 million due to the timing of payments associated with inventory. During fiscal 2006, cash provided by operations was $423.5 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $291.4 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in cash provided by operations of $132.1 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 resulted from an increase in net income of $57.5 million, primarily due to the addition of EBs results of operations since the mergers and the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006; an increase in depreciation and amortization of $43.5 million due primarily to the mergers; an increase in the growth in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net of growth in merchandise inventories and the provision for inventory reserves of $47.9 million caused by growth of the Company and efforts to manage working capital; an increase in the cash provided by prepaid taxes of $43.6 million offset by the change in the effect of the tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options of $56.1 million; and an increase in the non cash adjustment for stock based compensation expense due to the implementation of SFAS 123(R) in fiscal 2006 of $20.6 million, all of which were offset by a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $41.0 million due primarily to the store growth and the timing of rent payments at the end of the fiscal 2006. Cash used in investing activities was $174.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $125.9 million during fiscal 2006 and $996.8 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2007, $175.6 million of capital expenditures were primarily used to open 586 stores in the United States and internationally and to invest in information systems, which were offset by $1.1 million of cash received related to the finalization of the purchase price of Game Brands Inc. which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, $133.9 million of capital expenditures were primarily used to invest in information and distribution systems in support of the integration of the operations of EB, to open new stores in the United States and for international expansion. Also, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 37 Table of Contents 2006, the Company purchased Game Brands Inc., a 72 store video game retailer, for $11.3 million. These investing activities were offset by $19.3 million of cash provided by the sale of the Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center which were acquired in the mergers. During fiscal 2005, $886.1 million of cash was used to acquire EB. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 also included approximately $9.7 million to complete the build out of our new corporate headquarters and distribution center facility in Grapevine, Texas. The remaining $101.0 million in capital expenditures was used to open new stores, remodel existing stores and invest in information and distribution systems in support of the integration of the operations of EB and GameStop. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2007 was $131.8 million and $46.6 million during fiscal 2006. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2007 was due to the repurchase of $20.0 million and $250.0 million of principal value of the Companys senior notes and senior floating rate notes, respectively, and the $12.2 million principal payment in October 2007 on the Barnes Noble promissory note. The fiscal 2007 cash outflows were offset by $64.9 million received for the issuance of shares relating to stock option exercises and $93.3 million for the realization of tax benefits relating to the stock option exercises and vested restricted stock. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2006 was due to the repurchase of $50.0 million each of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes, the payment of the $12.2 million principal due in October 2006 on the Barnes Noble promissory note and the repayment of the $9.2 million mortgage on EBs Pennsylvania distribution center. The fiscal 2006 cash outflows were offset by $33.9 million received for the issuance of shares relating to stock option exercises and $43.8 million for the realization of tax benefits relating to the stock option exercises and vested restricted stock. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $935.7 million during fiscal 2005 which were primarily due to the issuance of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes in connection with the mergers. Our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened 586 stores in fiscal 2007 and expect to open approximately 575 to 600 stores in fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are projected to be approximately $170.0 million to $180.0 million, to be used primarily to fund new store openings and invest in distribution and information systems in support of operations. In October 2005, in connection with the merger, the Company entered into a five year, $400 million Credit Agreement (the Revolver), including a $50 million letter of credit sub limit, secured by the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. In April 2007, the Company amended the Revolver to extend the maturity date from October 11, 2010 to April 25, 2012, reduce the LIBO interest rate margin, reduce and fix the rate of the unused commitment fee and modify or delete certain other covenants. The availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (x) approximately 70% of eligible inventory and (y) 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 85% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Companys ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options and repurchase shares is generally prohibited, except that if availability under the Revolver is, or will be after any such payment, equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base, the Company may repurchase its capital stock and pay cash dividends. In addition, in the event that credit extensions under the Revolver at any time exceed 80% of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The interest rate on the Revolver is variable and, at the Companys option, is calculated by applying a margin of (1) 0.0% to 0.25% above the higher of the prime rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (2) 1.00% to 1.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. As of February 2, 2008, the applicable margin was 0.0% for prime rate loans and 1.00% for LIBO rate loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of February 2, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding totaled $6.8 million. 38 Table of Contents In September 2007, the Companys Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary, $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the Line of Credit) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit will be made available to the Companys foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of February 2, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding were $2.8 million. On September 28, 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. as co issuer (together with the Company, the Issuers), completed the offering of U.S. $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes) and U.S. $650 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes and, together with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the Notes). The Notes were issued under an Indenture (the Indenture), dated September 28, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). Concurrently with the consummation of the mergers on October 8, 2005, EB and its direct and indirect U.S. wholly owned subsidiaries (together, the EB Guarantors) became subsidiaries of the Company and entered into a First Supplemental Indenture, dated October 8, 2005, by and among the Issuers, the EB Guarantors and the Trustee, pursuant to which the EB Guarantors assumed all the obligations of a subsidiary guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture. The net proceeds of the offering were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to the stockholders of EB in connection with the mergers. The offering of the Notes was conducted in a private transaction under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and in transactions outside the United States in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. In April 2006, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S 4 in order to register new notes (the New Notes) with the same terms and conditions as the Notes in order to facilitate an exchange of the New Notes for the Notes. This registration statement on Form S 4 was declared effective by the SEC in May 2006 and the Company commenced an exchange offer to exchange the New Notes for the Notes. This exchange offer was completed in June 2006 with 100% participation. In November 2006, Citibank, N.A. resigned as Trustee for the Notes and Wilmington Trust Company was appointed as the new Trustee for the Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, mature on October 1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a discount at the time of issue of $8.5 million. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest method. As of February 2, 2008, the unamortized original issue discount was $5.5 million. The rate of interest on the Senior Floating Rate Notes prior to their redemption on October 1, 2007 was 9.2350% per annum. The Issuers pay interest on the Senior Notes semi annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limitations on (1) the incurrence of additional debt, (2) restricted payments, (3) liens, (4) sale and leaseback transactions and (5) asset sales. Events of default provided for in the Indenture include, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal on the Notes, other breaches of covenants in the Indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. As of February 2, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Revolver and the Indenture. Under certain conditions, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions prior to maturity redeem up to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture at redemption prices at or in excess of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The circumstances which would limit the percentage of the Notes which may be redeemed or which would require the Company to pay a premium in excess of 100% of the principal amount are defined in the Indenture. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers are required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. 39 Table of Contents The Issuers may acquire the Notes by means other than redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. In May 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of $100 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes and Senior Notes. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had repurchased the maximum authorized amount, having acquired $50.0 million of its Senior Notes and $50.0 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes, and delivered the Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on retirement of debt was $6.1 million, which consists of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. On February 9, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of an additional $150 million of its Senior Notes and Senior Floating Rate Notes. The timing and amount of the repurchases were determined by the Companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions and other factors. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had repurchased the additional $150 million of the Notes, having acquired $20.0 million of its Senior Notes and $130.0 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes, and delivered the Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on retirement of this debt was $8.8 million, which consists of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. On June 28, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the redemption of the remaining $120 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes outstanding. The Company redeemed the Senior Floating Rate Notes on October 1, 2007 at the redemption price specified by the Senior Floating Rate Notes of 102.0%, plus all accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date. The Company incurred a one time pre tax charge of $3.8 million associated with the redemption, which represents a $2.4 million redemption premium and $1.4 million to recognize unamortized deferred financing costs. Subsequently, on February 7, 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of an additional $130 million of its Senior Notes. The timing and amount of the repurchases will be determined by the Companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions and other factors. In addition, the repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. At the time of this filing, the Company had repurchased $24.7 million of its Senior Notes pursuant to this new authorization and delivered the Senior Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on retirement of debt is $1.9 million, which consists of the premium paid to retire the Senior Notes and the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Senior Notes. In October 2004, Historical GameStop issued a promissory note in favor of Barnes Noble in the principal amount of $74.0 million in connection with the repurchase of Historical GameStops common stock held by Barnes Noble. The note was unsecured and bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable with each principal installment. Scheduled principal payments of $37.5 million, $12.2 million and $12.2 million were made in January 2005, October 2005 and October 2006, respectively, as required by the promissory note. The final payment of $12.2 million, satisfying the promissory note in full, was made in October 2007. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our operations, required interest payments on the Senior Notes, store expansion and remodeling activities and corporate capital expenditure programs for at least the next 12 months. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of February 2, 2008: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 812.0 $ 46.4 $ 92.8 $ 672.8 $ Operating Leases 1,018.3 261.5 394.0 226.4 136.4 Purchase Obligations(2) 609.0 609.0 Total $ 2,439.3 $ 916.9 $ 486.8 $ 899.2 $ 136.4 (1) The long term debt consists of $580.0 million (principal value), which bears interest at 8.0% per annum. Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. In addition to minimum rentals, the operating leases generally require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs and may provide for percentage rentals. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term, including renewal options for those leases in which it is reasonably assured that the Company will exercise the renewal option. The Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding. The Company has entered into employment agreements with R. Richard Fontaine, Daniel A. DeMatteo, Steven R. Morgan and David W. Carlson. The terms of the employment agreement for Mr. Fontaine and Mr. DeMatteo commenced on April 11, 2005 and continue for a period of three years thereafter, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Morgan commenced on December 9, 2005 and continued through February 12, 2008, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Carlson commenced on April 3, 2006 and continues for a period of two years thereafter, with automatic annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to automatic renewal. Each of these employment agreements will automatically renew for a period of one year as no notice of non renewals were given. Mr. Fontaines minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $650,000. Mr. DeMatteos minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $535,000. Mr. Morgans minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $450,000. Mr. Carlsons minimum annual salary during the term of his employment under the employment agreement shall be no less than $350,000. The Board of Directors of the Company has set Mr. Fontaines, Mr. DeMatteos, Mr. Morgans and Mr. Carlsons salaries for fiscal 2008 at $1,200,000, $960,000, $575,000 and $440,000, respectively. As of February 2, 2008, we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $6.8 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $10.7 million, $7.9 million of which are cash collateralized. As of February 2, 2008, the Company had $24.2 million of income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. In 2003, the Company purchased a 51% controlling interest in GameStop Group Limited. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the individual owners of the remaining 49% interest have the ability to require the Company to purchase their remaining shares in incremental percentages at a price to be determined based partially on the Companys price to earnings ratio and GameStop Group Limiteds earnings. No additional shares have been 41 Table of Contents purchased by the Company to date. The Company already consolidates the results of GameStop Group Limited; therefore, any additional amounts acquired will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of February 2, 2008, the Company had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S K. Impact of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions The Company operates departments within nine bookstores operated by Barnes Noble, an affiliate through a common stockholder who is chairman of the board of directors of Barnes Noble and a member of the Companys Board of Directors. The Company pays a license fee to Barnes Noble in amounts equal to 7.0% of the gross sales of such departments. Management deems the license fee to be reasonable and based upon terms equivalent to those that would prevail in an arms length transaction. During the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, these charges amounted to $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Until June 2005, Historical GameStop participated in Barnes Nobles workers compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by Barnes Noble under these programs were allocated to Historical GameStop based upon total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history of Historical GameStop. Management deemed the allocation methodology to be reasonable. Although the Company secured its own insurance coverage, costs will likely continue to be incurred by Barnes Noble on insurance claims which were incurred under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against Historical GameStop will be allocated to the Company. During the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, these allocated charges amounted to $0.3 million, $0.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively. In October 2004, the Board of Directors of Historical GameStop authorized a repurchase of Historical GameStop common stock held by Barnes Noble. Historical GameStop repurchased 12,214,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to $9.13 per share for aggregate consideration before expenses of $111.5 million. Historical GameStop paid $37.5 million in cash and issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $74.0 million, which has been repaid as of October 2007. Scheduled principal payments were made of $37.5 million in January 2005 and $12.2 million in each of October 2005, October 2006 and October 2007. Interest expense on the promissory note for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006 totaled $0.4 million, $1.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively. In May 2005, the Company entered into an arrangement with Barnes Noble under which www.gamestop.com became the exclusive specialty video game retailer listed on www.bn.com, Barnes Nobles e commerce site. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company pays a fee to Barnes Noble for sales of video game or PC entertainment products sold through www.bn.com. The fee paid to Barnes Noble in connection with this arrangement was $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006, respectively. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and their effect on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company on February 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 161 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 42 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) amends the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for the Company on February 1, 2009, and the Company will apply SFAS 141(R) prospectively to all business combinations subsequent to the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the controlling and noncontrolling interests and requires the separate disclosure of income attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). This statement permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specific election dates. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159 was effective for our Company on February 3, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The Company adopted SFAS 157 on February 3, 2008 as required for its financial assets and liabilities. However, in February 2008, the FASB released a FASB Staff Position, FSP FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS 157 for our financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 for our non financial assets and liabilities, effective February 1, 2009, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term, highly liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. In addition, the Senior Notes outstanding issued in connection with the mergers carry a fixed interest rate. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances, and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest. 43 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS 133) as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, depending on the type of hedge transaction. The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps, (together, the Foreign Currency Contracts) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. The aggregate fair value of the Foreign Currency Contracts at February 2, 2008 was a liability of $7.6 million. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the Foreign Currency Contracts from the market rate as of February 2, 2008 would result in a (loss) or gain in value of the forwards, options and swaps of ($7.0 million) or $5.7 million, respectively.
