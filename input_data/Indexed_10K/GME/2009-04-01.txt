Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, managements plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. General GameStop Corp. (together with its predecessor companies, GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company) is the worlds largest retailer of video game products and PC entertainment software. We sell new and used video game hardware, video game software and accessories, as well as PC entertainment software and other merchandise. As of January 31, 2009, we operated 6,207 stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, primarily under the names GameStop and EB Games. We also operate an electronic commerce website under the name www.gamestop.com and publish Game Informer, the industrys largest multi platform video game magazine in the United States based on circulation. Our fiscal year is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2008) and February 2, 2008 (fiscal 2007) consisted of 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 (fiscal 2006) consisted of 53 weeks. The Company began operations in November 1996. In October 1999, the Company was acquired by, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Barnes Noble, Inc. (Barnes Noble). In February 2002, GameStop completed an initial public offering of its Class A common stock and was a majority owned subsidiary of Barnes Noble until November 2004, when Barnes Noble distributed its holdings of outstanding GameStop Class B common stock to its stockholders. In October 2005, GameStop acquired the operations of Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. (EB), a 2,300 store video game retailer in the U.S. and 12 other countries, by merging its existing operations with EB under GameStop Corp. (the EB merger). On February 7, 2007, following approval by a majority of the Class B common stockholders in a special meeting of the Companys Class B common stockholders, all outstanding Class B common shares were converted 26 Table of Contents into Class A common shares on a one for one basis (the Conversion). In addition, on February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a two for one stock split, effected by a one for one stock dividend to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007, paid on March 16, 2007 (the Stock Split). Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been restated to reflect the Conversion and the Stock Split. On November 17, 2008, GameStop France SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of SFMI Micromania SAS (Micromania) for $580.4 million, net of cash acquired in the transaction. Micromania is a leading retailer of video and computer games in France with 332 locations, 328 of which were operating on the date of acquisition (the Micromania acquisition). The Company funded the transaction with cash on hand, funds drawn against its revolving credit facility totaling $275 million, and term loans totaling $150 million. As of January 31, 2009, amounts drawn against the revolving credit facility and the term loans have been repaid. The Companys operating results for fiscal 2008 include 11 weeks of Micromanias results. Growth in the video game industry is driven by the introduction of new technology. In 2005 in the North American markets, Sony introduced the PlayStation Portable (the PSP) in March and Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 in November. In November 2006, Nintendo introduced the Wii hardware platform worldwide and Sony introduced the PlayStation 3 hardware platform in the North American markets. Sony introduced the PlayStation 3 platform in the Australian and European markets in March 2007. Typically, following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware increase as a percentage of total sales in the first full year following introduction. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the subsequent years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the years subsequent to the first full year following the launch period. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price reductions, further driving sales of related software and accessories. We expect that the installed base of the hardware platforms listed above and sales of related software and accessories will increase in the future. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events: Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the Companys financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time of sale and is stated net of sales discounts. The sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Sales returns (which are not significant) are recognized at the time returns are made. Subscription and advertising revenues are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers. Magazine subscription revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period. Gift cards sold to customers are recognized as a liability on the balance sheet until redeemed. Stock Based Compensation. The Company records share based compensation expense in earnings based on the grant date fair value of options or restricted stock granted. As of January 31, 2009, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options and restricted stock was $14.3 million and $23.4 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average 27 Table of Contents period of 1.9 and 1.8 years, respectively. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information on stock based compensation. Merchandise Inventories. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on hand and this amount is re averaged over the cumulative units. Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with inventory markdowns. We also adjust inventory based on anticipated physical inventory losses or shrinkage. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the reported inventory is accurate. During interim periods, estimates of shrinkage are recorded based on historical losses in the context of current period circumstances. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives (ranging from two to eight years). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including renewal options in which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred to third parties in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational. The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including managements intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected cash flows. Write downs incurred by the Company through January 31, 2009 have not been material. Goodwill. Goodwill, aggregating $1,862.1 million, has been recorded as of January 31, 2009 related to various acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, instead it evaluates it for impairment on at least an annual basis. The Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information concerning goodwill. Other Intangible Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets. Other intangible assets consist primarily of tradenames, leasehold rights and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition and the EB merger. Intangible assets are recorded consistent with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), which requires that intangible assets shall be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if they arise from a contractual right and are capable of being separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged individually. The useful life and amortization methodology of intangible assets are based on the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that the assets should be amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly to cash flows. Tradenames which were recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition are considered indefinite life intangible assets as they are expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and are not subject to 28 Table of Contents amortization, but they are subject to annual impairment testing. Leasehold rights which were recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition represent the value of rights of tenancy under commercial property leases for properties located in France. Rights pertaining to individual leases can be sold by us to a new tenant or recovered by us from the landlord if the exercise of the automatic right of renewal is refused. Leasehold rights are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term not to exceed 20 years with no residual value. Favorable leasehold interests represent the value of the contractual monthly rental payments that are less than the current market rent at stores acquired as part of the Micromania acquisition or the EB merger. Favorable leasehold interests are amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining lease term with no expected residual value. For additional information related to the Companys intangible assets, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other non current assets are made up of deposits and deferred financing fees. The deferred financing fees are associated with the Companys revolving credit facility and the senior notes issued in October 2005 in connection with the financing of the EB merger. The deferred financing fees are being amortized over five and seven years to match the terms of the revolving credit facility and the senior notes, respectively. Deferred financing fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the senior floating rate notes in October 2005 in connection with the EB merger were included in deferred financing fees in the balance sheet and were being amortized over six years to match the term of the senior floating rate notes. The remaining balance of the deferred financing fees on the senior floating rate notes was written off to debt extinguishment expense during fiscal 2007 when the notes were redeemed. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors. The Company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02 16, results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The Company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year, the Company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods, including estimates of full year vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory. Estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases. Determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known. Although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances. In addition, management believes that the Companys revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances, but management is unable to quantify the impact. Lease Accounting. The Companys method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability) and leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) is in conformance with GAAP, as clarified by the Chief Accountant of the SEC in a February 2005 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which we are reasonably assured of exercising lease options and we include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed, or rent holiday. 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 utilizes an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. We generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized under SFAS 109. FIN 48 addresses the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. For additional information related to the Companys adoption of FIN 48, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain income statement items as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended January 31, February 2, February 3, 2009 2008 2007 Statement of Operations Data: Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 74.2 74.4 72.3 Gross profit 25.8 25.6 27.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.4 16.7 19.2 Depreciation and amortization 1.6 1.8 2.1 Merger related expenses 0.1 0.1 Operating earnings 7.7 7.1 6.3 Interest expense, net 0.5 0.7 1.4 Debt extinguishment expense 0.2 0.1 Earnings before income taxes 7.2 6.2 4.8 Income tax expense 2.7 2.1 1.8 Net earnings 4.5 % 4.1 % 3.0 % The Company includes purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, rather than cost of goods sold, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, these purchasing, receiving and distribution costs amounted to $57.0 million, $43.9 million and $35.9 million, respectively. The Company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales, rather than selling, general and administrative expenses, in the statement of operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, these processing fees amounted to $65.5 million, $55.2 million and $40.9 million, respectively. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit 30 Table of Contents cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The reclassifications had a net effect of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.1% of sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. The following table sets forth sales (in millions) by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks 52 Weeks 53 Weeks Ended Ended Ended January 31, February 2, February 3, 2009 2008 2007 Percent Percent Percent Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales: New video game hardware $ 1,860.2 21.1 % $ 1,668.9 23.5 % $ 1,073.7 20.2 % New video game software 3,685.0 41.9 % 2,800.7 39.5 % 2,012.5 37.8 % Used video game products 2,026.6 23.0 % 1,586.7 22.4 % 1,316.0 24.8 % Other 1,234.1 14.0 % 1,037.7 14.6 % 916.7 17.2 % Total $ 8,805.9 100.0 % $ 7,094.0 100.0 % $ 5,318.9 100.0 % Other products include PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and character related merchandise. The following table sets forth gross profit (in millions) and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks 52 Weeks 53 Weeks Ended Ended Ended January 31, February 2, February 3, 2009 2008 2007 Gross Gross Gross Gross Profit Gross Profit Gross Profit Profit Percent Profit Percent Profit Percent Gross Profit: New video game hardware $ 112.6 6.1 % $ 108.2 6.5 % $ 77.0 7.2 % New video game software 768.4 20.9 % 581.7 20.8 % 427.3 21.2 % Used video game products 974.5 48.1 % 772.2 48.7 % 651.9 49.5 % Other 414.6 33.6 % 351.6 33.9 % 315.2 34.4 % Total $ 2,270.1 25.8 % $ 1,813.7 25.6 % $ 1,471.4 27.7 % Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Despite worldwide economic conditions, sales increased $1,711.9 million, or 24.1%, to $8,805.9 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2008 compared to $7,094.0 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007. The increase in sales was attributable to the comparable store sales increase of 12.3% for fiscal 2008 when compared to fiscal 2007, the addition of non comparable store sales from the 1,588 stores opened since February 3, 2007 of approximately $698.2 million and the acquisition of Micromania, offset by decreases related to changes in foreign exchange rates of $71.6 million. The comparable store sales increase was driven by strong sales of new and used video game software which is typical as the installed base of new hardware platforms increases in the years following their launch. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation and exclude the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. New video game hardware sales increased $191.3 million, or 11.5%, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new hardware platforms and the increase in store count since the end of fiscal 2007, including the Micromania acquisition. New video game hardware sales decreased as a percentage of sales from 23.5% in fiscal 2007 to 21.1% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to strong sales of new video game software driven by the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles and a strong lineup of video game titles in fiscal 2008. 31 Table of Contents New video game software sales increased $884.3 million, or 31.6%, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the strong sales of new video game titles released in fiscal 2008 and the increased sales of software related to the new hardware platforms, as well as the new and acquired stores added since the end of fiscal 2007. New video game software sales increased as a percentage of total sales from 39.5% in fiscal 2007 to 41.9% in fiscal 2008 due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles, as well as the availability of several strong new titles in fiscal 2008. Used video game product sales increased $439.9 million, or 27.7%, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in store count and an increase in the availability of hardware and software associated with the new hardware platforms as those platforms age and expand. As a percentage of sales, used video game product sales increased from 22.4% to 23.0% primarily due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles and the availability of used hardware and software from those consoles. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and trading cards, grew 18.9%, or $196.4 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increase in store count and strong sales of new PC entertainment software and sales of accessories related to the new hardware platforms. Cost of sales increased by $1,255.5 million, or 23.8%, from $5,280.3 million in fiscal 2007 to $6,535.8 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of the increase in sales and the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $456.4 million, or 25.2%, from $1,813.7 million in fiscal 2007 to $2,270.1 million in fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% in fiscal 2007 to 25.8% in fiscal 2008. The gross profit percentage increase was caused primarily by the shift in sales from new video game hardware to new video game software and used video game products as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2008 as the new platforms mature. These product categories carry a significantly higher margin than new video game hardware. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware decreased from 6.5% in fiscal 2007 to 6.1% in fiscal 2008 due primarily to a decrease in product replacement plan sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game software and other products remained relatively consistent from 20.8% and 33.9%, respectively, in fiscal 2007 compared to 20.9% and 33.6%, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products decreased from 48.7% in fiscal 2007 to 48.1% in fiscal 2008 due to increased promotional activities and higher refurbishment costs associated with an increase in production of refurbished hardware platforms during fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $263.4 million, or 22.3%, from $1,182.0 million in fiscal 2007 to $1,445.4 million in fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 16.7% in fiscal 2007 to 16.4% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leveraging as a result of the higher sales associated with the growth of the video game market and cost control efforts. Selling, general and administrative expenses include $35.4 million and $26.9 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to ($6.4) million in fiscal 2008, compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $130.3 million in fiscal 2007 to $145.0 million in fiscal 2008. This increase of $14.7 million was due primarily to capital expenditures associated with the opening of 674 new stores during fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase from fiscal 2008 to the 52 week period ending January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2009) due to continued capital expenditures for new stores and investments in management information systems. Interest income from the investment of excess cash balances decreased from $13.8 million in fiscal 2007 to $11.6 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of lower invested cash balances due to acquisitions and lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased from $61.6 million in fiscal 2007 to $50.5 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the retirement of $30.0 million of the Companys senior notes since February 2, 2008 and the retirement of $270.0 million in senior notes and senior floating rate notes during fiscal 2007. Debt extinguishment expense of $2.3 million and $12.6 million was recognized in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, as a result of the 32 Table of Contents premiums paid related to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Income tax expense increased by $82.9 million, from $152.8 million in fiscal 2007 to $235.7 million in fiscal 2008. The Companys effective tax rate increased from 34.6% in fiscal 2007 to 37.2% in fiscal 2008 due to expenses related to mergers and acquisitions and associated corporate structuring and the deemed repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries. In addition, during fiscal 2007 there were valuation allowances released on foreign net operating losses. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $173.7 million, or 34.6%, from $501.4 million in fiscal 2007 to $675.1 million in fiscal 2008 and an increase in net earnings of $110.0 million, or 38.2%, from $288.3 million in fiscal 2007 to $398.3 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Sales increased by $1,775.1 million, or 33.4%, to $7,094.0 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007 compared to $5,318.9 million in the 53 weeks of fiscal 2006. The increase in sales was attributable to the comparable store sales increase of 24.7% for fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006, the addition of non comparable store sales from the 1,007 stores opened since January 29, 2006 of approximately $496.2 million and increases related to changes in foreign exchange rates of $109.4 million, offset by sales of $99.1 million for the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006. The comparable store sales increase was driven by continued strong sales of the Nintendo Wii, Microsofts Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation 3, which completed its worldwide launch during fiscal 2007, and their related software and accessories, including several strong video game titles, such as Halo 3 and Guitar Hero III. The comparable store sales increase of 24.7% was calculated by using the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007 compared to the most closely comparable 52 weeks of fiscal 2006 with consideration given to the timing of holidays to ensure comparability. New video game hardware sales increased $595.2 million, or 55.4%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the sales of hardware units mentioned above, as well as the increase in store count since January 2007, offset by the 53rd week of sales included in fiscal 2006. New video game hardware sales increased as a percentage of sales from 20.2% in fiscal 2006 to 23.5% in fiscal 2007, primarily due to the first full year since the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 launch as well as increasing sales of Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DS. New video game software sales increased $788.2 million, or 39.2%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to new stores added in fiscal 2007, sales related to the new hardware platforms and a strong lineup of new video game titles released during the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. New video game software sales as a percentage of total sales increased from 37.8% in fiscal 2006 to 39.5% in fiscal 2007 due to increased sales related to the new hardware platforms and the availability of several strong titles in fiscal 2007. Used video game product sales increased $270.7 million, or 20.6%, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the increase in new store count, an increase in overall demand for video game products following the launch of new hardware platforms and the strong growth of used video game product sales internationally, offset by the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of sales, used video game product sales decreased from 24.8% to 22.4% primarily due to the strong sales of new video game hardware and software. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and trading cards, grew 13.2%, or $121.0 million, from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the increase in store count and the increase in new hardware platform accessories sales, offset by the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. Cost of sales increased by $1,432.8 million, or 37.2%, from $3,847.5 million in fiscal 2006 to $5,280.3 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of the increase in sales and the changes in gross profit discussed below, offset by the 53rd week of sales in fiscal 2006. Gross profit increased by $342.3 million, or 23.3%, from $1,471.4 million in fiscal 2006 to $1,813.7 million in fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.7% in fiscal 2006 to 25.6% in fiscal 2007. The gross profit percentage decrease was caused primarily by the increase in sales of new video game hardware as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2007. New video game hardware typically carries a much lower margin than sales 33 Table of Contents in the other product categories. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was also impacted by a decrease in the excess of vendor allowances received over marketing and advertising expenses. Vendor allowances received during fiscal 2006 were abnormally high due to the launches of the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation 3 and returned to normal levels in fiscal 2007. In addition, net vendor allowances decreased due to higher expenditures on marketing and advertising from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 in support of the Companys branding campaign. These factors led to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware, new video game software and other products from 7.2%, 21.2% and 34.4% of sales, respectively, in fiscal 2006 to 6.5%, 20.8% and 33.9% of sales, respectively, in fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products decreased from 49.5% in fiscal 2006 to 48.7% in fiscal 2007 due to increased promotional expenses and higher refurbishment costs associated with an increase in production of refurbished hardware platforms during fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $160.9 million, or 15.8%, from $1,021.1 million in fiscal 2006 to $1,182.0 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses, offset by expenses from the 53rd week included in fiscal 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 19.2% in fiscal 2006 to 16.7% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leveraging as a result of the higher sales associated with the introduction of the new video game systems and synergies associated with the acquisition of EB. Selling, general and administrative expenses include $26.9 million and $21.0 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $8.6 million in fiscal 2007, compared to ($1.0) million in fiscal 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $109.9 million in fiscal 2006 to $130.3 million in fiscal 2007. This increase of $20.4 million was due primarily to capital expenditures for 586 new GameStop stores. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from $11.3 million in fiscal 2006 to $13.8 million in fiscal 2007 due to interest earned on invested assets. Interest expense decreased from $84.7 million in fiscal 2006 to $61.6 million in fiscal 2007, primarily due to the retirement of $20.0 million of the Companys senior notes and $250.0 million of the Companys senior floating rate notes since February 3, 2007. Debt extinguishment expense of $12.6 million was recognized in fiscal 2007 as a result of the premiums paid related to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Debt extinguishment expense of $6.1 million was incurred in fiscal 2006 for the loss associated with the Companys repurchase of $50.0 million of its senior notes payable and $50.0 million of its senior floating rate notes payable. Income tax expense increased by $56.8 million, from $96.0 million in fiscal 2006 to $152.8 million in fiscal 2007. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 37.8% in fiscal 2006 to 34.6% in fiscal 2007 due to the release of foreign valuation allowances on net operating losses and the recognition of foreign tax credits not previously benefited. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $167.7 million, or 50.3%, from $333.7 million in fiscal 2006 to $501.4 million in fiscal 2007 and an increase in net earnings of $130.0 million, or 82.1%, from $158.3 million in fiscal 2006 to $288.3 million in fiscal 2007. Segment Performance The Company operates its business in the following segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance and how we divide management responsibility. Each of the segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and used video game systems, software and accessories which we refer to as video game products and PC entertainment software and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products in the various segments.

Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased 18.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 as a result of increased sales at existing stores and the opening of 643 new stores since February 3, 2007, including 315 stores in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Sales at existing stores increased due to strong sales of new video game software and used video game products which is typical in the years following the release of new hardware platforms. As the installed base of the new hardware platforms expands, more new software titles become available and trade ins of used video game products applied toward the purchase of new video games lead to increased sales of new and used video game products. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended 35 Table of Contents January 31, 2009 increased by 35.5% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, driven by strong sales of new video game software and used video game products and their related accessories, as well as the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses. Canada Sales in the Canadian segment in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased 15.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008.

Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 decreased by 8.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The decrease in operating income when compared to the prior year was due primarily to a lower gross margin percentage driven by economic issues and competitive issues stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Australia Segment results for Australia include retail operations in Australia and New Zealand.

The increase in sales at existing stores was due to a strong video game software title lineup and the availability of the new hardware platforms in fiscal 2008 when compared to the prior fiscal year following the launch of the Sony PlayStation 3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, the new hardware platforms drove an increase in used product sales as the installed base of platforms increased and more software became available. Segment operating income in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased by 12.0% when compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in operating earnings for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 was due to the higher sales and related gross margin offset by the higher selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation and the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates since the prior year.

As of January 31, 2009, the European segment operated 1,201 stores, compared to 636 stores as of February 2, 2008. For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, European sales increased 66.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in sales was primarily due to the additional sales at the 754 stores opened since February 3, 2007, including the 328 stores from the Micromania acquisition and the 49 stores acquired from Free Record Shop Norway AS, a Norwegian private limited liability company (FRS), in Norway during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the increase in sales at existing stores.

In addition, the new hardware platforms drove an increase in used product sales as the installed base of the platforms increased and more software became available. The segment operating income in Europe for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased to $65.6 million compared to $32.6 million in the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008.

The increase in sales was primarily due to the increase in sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 271 stores opened since January 28, 2006. The increase in store count was offset by store closings in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, primarily in Spain, as part of the implementation of the integration strategy of the acquisition of EB.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows During fiscal 2008, cash provided by operations was $549.2 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $484.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in cash provided by operations of $64.4 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by net earnings, including the non cash adjustments to net earnings, of $80.7 million and a decrease in the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards of $59.1 million. These amounts were offset by an increase in cash used in operations for working capital of $75.4 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in merchandise inventories resulting from an increase in store count and sales levels. During fiscal 2007, cash provided by operations was $484.8 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $420.1 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in cash provided by operations of $64.7 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase in the cash provided by net earnings, including the non cash adjustments to net earnings, of $168.5 million offset by an increase in the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards of $49.5 million.

These cash outflows were offset by $64.9 million received for the issuance of shares relating to stock option exercises and $93.3 million for the realization of tax benefits relating to the exercise of stock based awards. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the repurchase of $50.0 million each of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes, the payment of the $12.2 million principal due on the Barnes Noble promissory note and the repayment of the $9.1 million mortgage on EBs Pennsylvania distribution center. The fiscal 2006 outflows were offset by $33.9 million received for the issuance of shares relating to stock option exercises and $43.8 million for the realization of tax benefits relating to the exercise of stock based awards. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various growth initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value, and consist primarily of time deposits with highly rated commercial banks and money market investment funds holding direct U.S. Treasury obligations. In October 2005, in connection with the EB merger, the Company entered into a five year, $400 million Credit Agreement (the Revolver), including a $50 million letter of credit sub limit, secured by the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. In April 2007, the Company amended the Revolver to extend the maturity date from October 11, 2010 to April 25, 2012, reduce the LIBO interest rate margin, reduce and fix the rate of the unused commitment fee and modify or delete certain other covenants. The availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (x) approximately 70% of eligible inventory and (y) 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 85% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Companys ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options, and repurchase shares is generally prohibited, except that if availability under the Revolver is or will be after any such payment equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base, the Company may repurchase its capital stock and pay cash dividends. In addition, in the event that credit extensions under the Revolver at any time exceed 80% of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The per annum interest rate on the Revolver is variable and, at the Companys option, is calculated by applying a margin of (1) 0.0% to 0.25% above the higher of the prime rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (2) 1.00% to 1.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 31, 2009, the applicable margin was 0.0% for prime rate loans and 1.00% for LIBO rate loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of January 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding totaled $7.7 million. In October 2008, the Company amended the Revolver to permit both the acquisition of Micromania and a committed $150.0 million junior term loan facility (the Term Loans). In addition, during any period for which the 39 Table of Contents Term Loans were outstanding, the amendment increased the applicable margin under the Revolver (i) payable on LIBO rate loans to a range of 1.5% to 2.0% from the current range of 1.0% to 1.5% and (ii) payable on prime rate loans to a range of 0.5% to 0.75% from the current range of 0.0% to 0.25%. The margins applicable prior to the entry into the amendment apply once the Term Loans are no longer outstanding. The Term Loans were outstanding during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In November 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Micromania, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A and Banc of America Securities LLC. The Term Loan Agreement provided for Term Loans in the aggregate of $150.0 million, consisting of a $50.0 million secured term loan (Term Loan A) and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan (Term Loan B). The Term Loan Agreement provided that the principal of Term Loan B was to be repaid in four equal installments of $25.0 million a week for four consecutive weeks, commencing on December 3, 2008. Term Loan A was scheduled to mature on March 31, 2009. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Agreement may not be reborrowed once repaid. Borrowings made pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement bore interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at a per annum rate equal to either (a) the prime loan rate, described in the Term Loan Agreement as the higher of (i) Bank of America N.A.s prime rate or (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, in each case plus 1.75%, or (b) the LIBO rate (a publicly published rate) plus 3.75%. The effective interest rate on Term Loan A was 5.75% per annum and the effective rate on Term Loan B ranged from 5% to 5.75% per annum. The Term Loan Agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on GameStop and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, changes of business and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Company was subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The covenants permitted the Company to use proceeds of the Term Loans for working capital, capital expenditures, payment of transaction costs and a portion of the consideration in connection with the acquisition of Micromania and for all other lawful corporate purposes. In November 2008, the Company borrowed $275.0 million under the Revolver and borrowed $150.0 million under the Term Loans in order to complete the acquisition of Micromania. As of January 31, 2009, the Revolver and the Term Loans were repaid in full. In September 2007, the Companys Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the Line of Credit) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit will be made available to the Companys foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of January 31, 2009, there were $5.6 million of cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $4.9 million. In September 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. as co issuer (together with the Company, the Issuers), completed the offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes and, together with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the Notes). The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated September 28, 2005 (the Indenture), by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). The net proceeds of the offering were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to the stockholders of EB in connection with the EB merger. In November 2006, Wilmington Trust Company was appointed as the new Trustee for the Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, mature on October 1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a discount at the time of issue of $8.5 million. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest method. As of January 31, 2009, the unamortized original issue discount was $4.3 million. The Issuers pay interest on the Senior Notes semi annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limitations on (1) the incurrence of additional debt, (2) restricted payments, (3) liens, (4) sale and leaseback transactions and (5) asset sales. Events of default provided for in the Indenture include, among other 40 Table of Contents things, failure to pay interest or principal on the Notes, other breaches of covenants in the Indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. As of January 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Revolver and the Indenture. Under certain conditions, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions prior to maturity redeem up to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issued under the Indenture at redemption prices at or in excess of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The circumstances which would limit the percentage of the Notes which may be redeemed or which would require the Company to pay a premium in excess of 100% of the principal amount are defined in the Indenture. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers are required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The Issuers may acquire Senior Notes by means other than redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. Uses of Capital Our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened 674 stores in fiscal 2008 and purchased 328 stores through our acquisition of Micromania. We expect to open approximately 400 stores in fiscal 2009. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are projected to be approximately $170 million, to be used primarily to fund new store openings and invest in distribution and information systems in support of operations. In May 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of $100 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes and Senior Notes. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had repurchased the maximum authorized amount, having acquired $50 million of its Senior Notes and $50 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes, and delivered the Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on the retirement of this debt was $6.1 million for the 53 week period ended February 3, 2007, which consists of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the recognition of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. On February 9, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of an additional $150 million of its Senior Notes and Senior Floating Rate Notes. As of August 4, 2007, the Company had repurchased the maximum authorized amount, having acquired $20 million of its Senior Notes and $130 million of its Senior Floating Rate Notes, and delivered the Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on the retirement of this debt was $8.8 million for the 52 week period ended February 2, 2008, which consists of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the recognition of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. On June 28, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the redemption of the remaining $120 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes outstanding. The Company redeemed the Senior Floating Rate Notes on October 1, 2007 at the redemption price specified by the Senior Floating Rate Notes of 102.00%, plus all accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date. The Company incurred a one time pre tax charge of $3.8 million associated with the redemption, which represents a $2.4 million redemption premium and $1.4 million to recognize unamortized deferred financing costs for the 52 week period ended February 2, 2008. On February 7, 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the buyback of up to an aggregate of an additional $130 million of its Senior Notes. The timing and amount of the repurchases will be determined by the Companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions and other factors. In addition, the repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of January 31, 2009, the Company had repurchased $30 million of its Senior Notes pursuant to this new authorization and delivered the Senior Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on retirement of debt is $2.3 million, which consists of the premium paid to retire the Senior Notes and the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Senior Notes for the 52 week period ended January 31, 2009. 41 Table of Contents In October 2004, GameStop issued a promissory note in favor of Barnes Noble in the principal amount of $74.0 million in connection with the repurchase of GameStops common stock held by Barnes Noble. The note was unsecured and bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable with each principal installment. Scheduled principal payments of $12.2 million and $12.2 million were made in October 2006 and October 2007, respectively, satisfying the promissory note in full. We used cash to expand the Company through acquisitions during fiscal 2008. On April 5, 2008, the Company purchased all the outstanding stock of FRS for $21.0 million, net of cash acquired. FRS operated 49 record stores in Norway and also operated office and warehouse facilities in Oslo, Norway. The Company converted these stores into video game stores with an inventory assortment similar to its other stores in Norway. In 2003, the Company purchased a 51% controlling interest in GameStop Group Limited which operates stores in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the minority interest owners of the remaining 49% have the ability to require the Company to purchase their remaining shares in incremental percentages at a price to be determined based partially on the Companys price to earnings ratio and GameStop Group Limiteds earnings. On May 21, 2008, the minority interest owners exercised their right to sell one third of their shares, or approximately 16% of GameStop Group Limited, to the Company under the terms of the original purchase agreement for $27.4 million. The transaction was completed in June 2008 and recorded in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 141. On November 17, 2008, GameStop France SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of GameStop, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of SFMI Micromania from L Capital, LV Capital, Europ@web and other shareholders of Micromania for approximately $580.4 million, net of cash acquired. Micromania is a leading retailer of video and computer games in France with 332 stores as of January 31, 2009. The Company funded the transaction with cash on hand, a draw on the Revolver totaling $275.0 million, and the Term Loans. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our operations, required payments on the Senior Notes, store expansion and remodeling activities and corporate capital expenditure programs for at least the next 12 months. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 726.0 $ 44.0 $ 88.0 $ 594.0 $ Operating Leases 972.8 295.1 387.1 179.5 111.1 Purchase Obligations(2) 734.3 734.3 Total $ 2,433.1 $ 1,073.4 $ 475.1 $ 773.5 $ 111.1 (1) The long term debt consists of $550.0 million (principal value), which bears interest at 8.0% per annum. Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. In addition to minimum rentals, the operating leases generally require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs and may provide for percentage rentals. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term, including renewal options for those leases in which it is reasonably assured that the Company will exercise the renewal option. The Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding. 42 Table of Contents The Company has entered into employment agreements with R. Richard Fontaine, Executive Chairman, Daniel A. DeMatteo, Chief Executive Officer, J. Paul Raines, Chief Operating Officer, David W. Carlson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Tony D. Bartel, Executive Vice President Merchandising and Marketing. The terms of the employment agreements with Mr. Fontaine and Mr. DeMatteo commenced on April 11, 2005 and continued for a period of three years thereafter and were automatically renewed in April 2008 for an additional year. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Raines commenced on September 7, 2008 and continues for a period of three years thereafter. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Carlson commenced on April 3, 2006 and continued for a period of two years thereafter and was automatically renewed in April 2008 for an additional year. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Bartel commenced on October 24, 2008 and continues for a period of three years thereafter. Each of these employment agreements contains provisions for automatic annual renewals unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to expiration. The employment agreements for Mr. Fontaine, Mr. DeMatteo and Mr. Carlson will automatically renew in April 2009 for a period of one year as no notice of non renewal was given. Each of the employment agreements was amended and restated on December 31, 2008 to bring them into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The minimum annual salaries during the term of employment under the amended and restated employment agreements for Messrs. Fontaine, DeMatteo, Raines, Carlson and Bartel shall be no less than $650,000, $535,000, $900,000, $350,000 and $400,000, respectively. The Board of Directors of the Company has set Messrs. Fontaines, DeMatteos, Raines, Carlsons and Bartels annual salaries for fiscal 2009 at $1,200,000, $1,250,000, $920,000, $500,000 and $500,000, respectively. As of January 31, 2009, we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $7.7 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $12.9 million, $7.9 million of which are cash collateralized. As of January 31, 2009, the Company had $32.2 million of income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. In 2003, the Company purchased a 51% controlling interest in GameStop Group Limited. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the individual owners of the remaining 49% interest have the ability to require the Company to purchase their remaining shares in incremental percentages at a price to be determined based partially on the Companys price to earnings ratio and GameStop Group Limiteds earnings. In June 2008, additional shares representing an interest of approximately 16% were purchased by the Company. The Company already consolidates the results of GameStop Group Limited; therefore, any additional amounts acquired will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2009, the Company had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S K. Impact of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions The Company operates departments within nine bookstores operated by Barnes Noble, a related party through a common stockholder who is chairman of the board of directors of Barnes Noble and a member of the Companys Board of Directors. The Company pays a license fee to Barnes Noble on the gross sales of such departments. The Company deems the license fee to be reasonable and based upon terms equivalent to those that would prevail in an arms length transaction. During the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 and the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007, these charges amounted to $1.3 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. 43 Table of Contents In May 2005, the Company entered into an arrangement with Barnes Noble under which www.gamestop.com became the exclusive specialty video game retailer listed on www.bn.com, Barnes Nobles e commerce site. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company pays a fee to Barnes Noble for sales of video game or PC entertainment products sold through www.bn.com. The fee paid to Barnes Noble in connection with this arrangement was $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 and the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007, respectively. Until June 2005, GameStop participated in Barnes Nobles workers compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by Barnes Noble under these programs were allocated to GameStop based upon total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history of GameStop. Management deemed the allocation methodology to be reasonable. Although the Company secured its own insurance coverage, costs will likely continue to be incurred by Barnes Noble on insurance claims which were incurred under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against GameStop will be allocated to the Company. During the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 and the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007, these allocated charges amounted to $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The Company had a promissory note in the favor of Barnes Noble in the principal amount of $74.0 million, in connection with the repurchase of the Companys common stock held by Barnes Noble in October 2004. The note was unsecured and bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable with each principal installment. Scheduled principal payments of $12.2 million were made in October 2006 and October 2007 and the note has been satisfied in full. Interest expense on the promissory note for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 and the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 totaled $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and their effect on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the Company on February 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 161 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) amends the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for the Company on February 1, 2009, and the Company will apply SFAS 141(R) prospectively to all business combinations subsequent to the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the controlling and noncontrolling interests and requires the separate disclosure of income attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 became effective for the Company on February 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The Company adopted SFAS 157 on February 3, 2008 as required for its financial assets and liabilities. However, in February 2008, the FASB released a FASB Staff Position, FSP FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non 44 Table of Contents financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS 157 for our financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 for our non financial assets and liabilities, effective February 1, 2009, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term, highly liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. In addition, the Senior Notes outstanding issued in connection with the EB merger carry a fixed interest rate. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances, and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest. Foreign Currency Risk The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, while SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, depending on the type of hedge transaction. The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps, (together, the Foreign Currency Contracts) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. The aggregate fair value of the Foreign Currency Contracts as of January 31, 2009 was an asset of $0.3 million as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, and industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the Foreign Currency Contracts from the market rate as of January 31, 2009 would result in a (loss) or gain in value of the forwards, options and swaps of ($17.7 million) or $17.7 million, respectively.
