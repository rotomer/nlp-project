Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, managements plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. General GameStop Corp. (together with its predecessor companies, GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company) is the worlds largest retailer of video game products and PC entertainment software. We sell new and used video game hardware, video game software and accessories, as well as PC entertainment software and other merchandise. As of January 30, 2010, we operated 6,450 stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, primarily under the names GameStop and EB Games. We also operate electronic commerce Web sites under the names www.gamestop.com, www.ebgames.com.au, www.gamestop.ca, www.gamestop.it, and www.micromania.fr and publish Game Informer, the industrys largest multi platform video game magazine in the United States based on circulation. Our fiscal year is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2009), January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2008) and February 2, 2008 (fiscal 2007) consisted of 52 weeks. The Company began operations in November 1996. In October 1999, the Company was acquired by, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Barnes Noble, Inc. (Barnes Noble). In February 2002, GameStop completed an initial public offering of its Class A common stock and was a majority owned subsidiary of Barnes Noble until November 2004, when Barnes Noble distributed its holdings of our common stock to its stockholders. In October 2005, GameStop acquired the operations of Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. (EB), a 2,300 store 26 Table of Contents video game retailer in the U.S. and 12 other countries, by merging its existing operations with EB under GameStop Corp. (the EB merger). On February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a two for one stock split, effected by a one for one stock dividend to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2007, paid on March 16, 2007 (the Stock Split). Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been restated to reflect the Stock Split. On November 17, 2008, GameStop France SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of SFMI Micromania SAS (Micromania) for $580.4 million, net of cash acquired in the transaction. Micromania is the leading retailer of video and computer games in France with 368 locations, 328 of which were operating on the date of acquisition (the Micromania acquisition). The Companys operating results for fiscal 2009 include Micromanias results and the Companys operating results for fiscal 2008 include 11 weeks of Micromanias results. The acquisition of Micromania is an important part of the Companys European and overall growth strategy and gave the Company an immediate entrance into the second largest video game market in Europe. The amount the Company paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was primarily for (i) the expected future cash flows derived from the existing business and its infrastructure, (ii) the geographical benefits from adding stores in a new large, growing market without cannibalizing existing sales, (iii) expanding the Companys expertise in the European video game market as a whole, and (iv) increasing the Companys impact on the European market, including increasing its purchasing power. Growth in the video game industry is driven by the introduction of new technology. The current generation of hardware consoles (the Sony PlayStation 3, the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii) were introduced between 2005 and 2007. The Sony PlayStation Portable (the PSP) was introduced in 2005. The Nintendo DSi was introduced in early 2009. Typically, following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware increase as a percentage of total sales in the first full year following introduction. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the subsequent years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the years subsequent to the first full year following the launch period. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price reductions, further driving sales of related software and accessories. We expect that the installed base of the hardware platforms listed above and sales of related software and accessories will increase in the future. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events: Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the Companys financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time of sale and is stated net of sales discounts. The sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Sales returns (which are not significant) are recognized at the time returns are made. Subscription and advertising revenues are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers. Magazine subscription revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period. Revenue 27 Table of Contents from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period. Gift cards sold to customers are recognized as a liability on the balance sheet until redeemed. Stock Based Compensation. The Company records share based compensation expense in earnings based on the grant date fair value of options or restricted stock granted. As of January 30, 2010, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options and restricted stock was $13.3 million and $19.8 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 and 1.7 years, respectively. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information on stock based compensation. Merchandise Inventories. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on hand and this amount is re averaged over the cumulative units. Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with inventory markdowns. We also adjust inventory based on anticipated physical inventory losses or shrinkage. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the reported inventory is accurate. During interim periods, estimates of shrinkage are recorded based on historical losses in the context of current period circumstances. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives (ranging from two to eight years). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including renewal options in which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred to third parties in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational. The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including managements intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected cash flows. Write downs incurred by the Company through January 30, 2010 have not been material. Goodwill. Goodwill, aggregating $1,946.5 million, has been recorded as of January 30, 2010 related to various acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company is required to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually. This test is completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired. Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. The Company has four business segments, the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, which also define our reporting units based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations within each segment, including the nature of products, product distribution and the type of customer and separate management within those regions. The Company estimates fair value based on the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit. The Company uses a two step process to measure goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is higher than its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, then the second test of goodwill impairment is needed. The second test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the 28 Table of Contents reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite life intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite life intangible asset is written down by the amount of the excess. The Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information concerning goodwill. The discounted cash flow method used to determine the fair value of reporting units requires management to make significant judgments based on the Companys projected sales and gross margin, annual business plans, future business strategies and economic factors. Discount rates used in the analysis reflect the Companys weighted average cost of capital, current market rates and the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The impairment testing process is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity, particularly related to sales and gross margin which can be impacted by various factors including the items listed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. While the fair value is determined based on the best available information at the time of assessment, any changes in business or economic conditions could materially increase or decrease the fair value of the reporting units net assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. Based on currently available information and forecasts of the Companys annual results, we do not anticipate recording any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in any of the Companys reporting units for the fiscal year ending January 29, 2011. Other Intangible Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets. Other intangible assets consist primarily of tradenames, leasehold rights and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition and the EB merger. We record intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from a contractual right and are capable of being separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged individually. The useful life and amortization methodology of intangible assets are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly to cash flows. Tradenames which were recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition are considered indefinite life intangible assets as they are expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and are not subject to amortization, but they are subject to annual impairment testing. Leasehold rights which were recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition represent the value of rights of tenancy under commercial property leases for properties located in France. Rights pertaining to individual leases can be sold by us to a new tenant or recovered by us from the landlord if the exercise of the automatic right of renewal is refused. Leasehold rights are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term not to exceed 20 years with no residual value. Favorable leasehold interests represent the value of the contractual monthly rental payments that are less than the current market rent at stores acquired as part of the Micromania acquisition or the EB merger. Favorable leasehold interests are amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining lease term with no expected residual value. For additional information related to the Companys intangible assets, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other non current assets are made up of deposits and deferred financing fees. The deferred financing fees are associated with the Companys revolving credit facility and the senior notes issued in October 2005 in connection with the financing of the EB merger. The deferred financing fees are being amortized over five and seven years to match the terms of the revolving credit facility and the senior notes, respectively. Deferred financing fees incurred in connection with the issuance of the senior floating rate notes in October 2005 in connection with the EB merger were included in deferred financing fees in the balance sheet and were being amortized over six years to match the term of the senior floating rate notes. The remaining balance of the deferred financing fees on the senior floating rate notes was written off to debt extinguishment expense during fiscal 2007 when the notes were redeemed. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors. The Company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory. The consideration serving 29 Table of Contents as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The Company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year, the Company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods, including estimates of full year vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory. Estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases. Determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known. Although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances. In addition, management believes that the Companys revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances, but management is unable to quantify the impact. Lease Accounting. The Companys method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability) and leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) is in conformance with GAAP. For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which we are reasonably assured of exercising lease options and we include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed, or rent holiday. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our Company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. We generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance that clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Our Company adopted the provisions of this accounting guidance and changed our accounting policy effective on February 4, 2007.

The Company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales, rather than selling, general and administrative expenses, in the statement of operations. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net effect of these classifications as a percentage of sales has not historically been material. The following table sets forth sales (in millions) by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended January 30, January 31, February 2, 2010 2009 2008 Percent Percent Percent Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales of Total Sales: New video game hardware $ 1,756.5 19.3 % $ 1,860.2 21.1 % $ 1,668.9 23.5 % New video game software 3,730.9 41.1 % 3,685.0 41.9 % 2,800.7 39.5 % Used video game products 2,394.1 26.4 % 2,026.6 23.0 % 1,586.7 22.4 % Other 1,196.5 13.2 % 1,234.1 14.0 % 1,037.7 14.6 % Total $ 9,078.0 100.0 % $ 8,805.9 100.0 % $ 7,094.0 100.0 % Other products include PC entertainment and other software, accessories and magazines. 31 Table of Contents The following table sets forth gross profit (in millions) and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended January 30, January 31, February 2, 2010 2009 2008 Gross Gross Gross Gross Profit Gross Profit Gross Profit Profit Percent Profit Percent Profit Percent Gross Profit: New video game hardware $ 113.5 6.5 % $ 112.6 6.1 % $ 108.2 6.5 % New video game software 795.0 21.3 % 768.4 20.9 % 581.7 20.8 % Used video game products 1,121.2 46.8 % 974.5 48.1 % 772.2 48.7 % Other 405.0 33.8 % 414.6 33.6 % 351.6 33.9 % Total $ 2,434.7 26.8 % $ 2,270.1 25.8 % $ 1,813.7 25.6 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Sales increased $272.1 million, or 3.1%, to $9,078.0 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2009 compared to $8,805.9 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2008. The increase in sales was attributable to the addition of non comparable store sales from the 1,062 stores opened since February 2, 2008, combined with the additional sales from the Micromania acquisition for an approximate total of $896 million and increases related to changes in foreign exchange rates of $25.9 million, offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of 7.9%. The decrease in comparable store sales was due primarily to a decrease in consumer traffic worldwide as a result of the continued macroeconomic weakness and a slow down in hardware unit sell through. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation and exclude the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. New video game hardware sales decreased $103.7 million, or 5.6%, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a decrease in consumer traffic as discussed above and price cuts on hardware consoles, partially offset by the additional sales at the new stores added since last year through growth and acquisition. New video game hardware sales decreased as a percentage of sales from 21.1% in fiscal 2008 to 19.3% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to the slow down in hardware unit sell through as the new platforms mature, as well as price decreases initiated by the manufacturers in fiscal 2009. New video game software sales increased $45.9 million, or 1.2%, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the addition of sales at the new and acquired stores added since fiscal 2008. New video game software sales decreased as a percentage of total sales from 41.9% in fiscal 2008 to 41.1% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to the 18% growth in used video game product sales as discussed below. Used video game product sales increased $367.5 million, or 18.1%, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, primarily due to an increase in the availability of hardware and software associated with the current generation hardware platforms as those platforms age and expand, the strong growth of used video game product sales internationally, as well as the addition of sales at the new and acquired stores added since fiscal 2008. As a percentage of sales, used video game product sales increased from 23.0% to 26.4%, primarily due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles and the availability of used hardware and software from those consoles. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, decreased 3.0%, or $37.6 million, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, primarily due to stronger sales of newly released PC entertainment software titles in fiscal 2008. Cost of sales increased by $107.5 million, or 1.6%, from $6,535.8 million in fiscal 2008 to $6,643.3 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of the increase in sales and the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $164.6 million, or 7.3%, from $2,270.1 million in fiscal 2008 to $2,434.7 million in fiscal 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 25.8% in fiscal 2008 to 26.8% in fiscal 2009. The gross profit percentage increase was caused primarily by the increase in sales of higher margin used video game products as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2009. Used video game product sales carry a significantly higher 32 Table of Contents margin than new video game hardware or new video game software. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware increased from 6.1% in fiscal 2008 to 6.5% in fiscal 2009 due primarily to an increase in product replacement plan sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game software increased from 20.9% in fiscal 2008 to 21.3% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to the mix of software sales and margin in the various countries in which we operate. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products decreased from 48.1% in fiscal 2008 to 46.8% in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased sales of used products in the international segments as a percentage of total sales. International used product sales have a lower margin due to the immaturity of the used business model in those segments. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on the other product sales category increased slightly in fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $189.7 million, or 13.1%, from $1,445.4 million in fiscal 2008 to $1,635.1 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to the full year effect of the acquisition of Micromania in November of fiscal 2008 and the increase in the number of stores in operation and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses to support the store growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 16.4% in fiscal 2008 to 18.0% in fiscal 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to deleveraging of fixed costs as a result of the decrease in comparable store sales in fiscal 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses include $37.8 million and $35.4 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $3.8 million in fiscal 2009, compared to ($6.4) million in fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17.5 million from $145.0 million in fiscal 2008 to $162.5 million in fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Micromania, capital expenditures associated with the opening of 388 new stores during fiscal 2009 and investments in management information systems. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 due to continued investments in new stores, management information systems and other strategic initiatives. Interest income from the investment of excess cash balances decreased from $11.6 million in fiscal 2008 to $2.2 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of lower invested cash balances due to the prior year acquisitions and lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased from $50.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $45.4 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to the retirement of $100.0 million of the Companys senior notes since January 31, 2009 and the retirement of $30.0 million of the Companys senior notes during fiscal 2008. Debt extinguishment expense of $5.3 million and $2.3 million was recognized in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, as a result of the premiums paid related to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Income tax expense decreased by $22.9 million, from $235.7 million in fiscal 2008 to $212.8 million in fiscal 2009. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 37.2% in fiscal 2008 to 36.2% in fiscal 2009 due primarily to audit settlements and statute expirations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to a decrease in operating earnings of $38.1 million, or 5.6%, from $675.1 million in fiscal 2008 to $637.0 million in fiscal 2009 and a decrease in consolidated net income of $22.6 million, or 5.7%, from $398.3 million in fiscal 2008 to $375.7 million in fiscal 2009. In 2009, the FASB issued new guidance related to the reporting of non controlling interests in subsidiaries. The $1.5 million increase in consolidated net income attributable to GameStop shareholders represents the portion of the minority interest shareholders net loss of the Companys non wholly owned subsidiaries during fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Sales increased $1,711.9 million, or 24.1%, to $8,805.9 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2008 compared to $7,094.0 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2007. The increase in sales was attributable to the comparable store sales increase of 12.3% for fiscal 2008 when compared to fiscal 2007, the addition of non comparable store sales from the 1,588 stores opened since February 3, 2007 of approximately $698.2 million and the acquisition of Micromania, offset by decreases related to changes in foreign exchange rates of $71.6 million. The comparable store sales increase was driven by strong sales of new and used video game software which is typical as the installed base of 33 Table of Contents new hardware platforms increases in the years following their launch. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation and exclude the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. New video game hardware sales increased $191.3 million, or 11.5%, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new hardware platforms and the increase in store count since the end of fiscal 2007, including the Micromania acquisition. New video game hardware sales decreased as a percentage of sales from 23.5% in fiscal 2007 to 21.1% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to strong sales of new video game software driven by the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles and a strong lineup of video game titles in fiscal 2008. New video game software sales increased $884.3 million, or 31.6%, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the strong sales of new video game titles released in fiscal 2008 and the increased sales of software related to the new hardware platforms, as well as the new and acquired stores added since the end of fiscal 2007. New video game software sales increased as a percentage of total sales from 39.5% in fiscal 2007 to 41.9% in fiscal 2008 due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles, as well as the availability of several strong new titles in fiscal 2008. Used video game product sales increased $439.9 million, or 27.7%, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in store count and an increase in the availability of hardware and software associated with the new hardware platforms as those platforms age and expand. As a percentage of sales, used video game product sales increased from 22.4% to 23.0% primarily due to the continued expansion of the installed base of new video game consoles and the availability of used hardware and software from those consoles. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, magazines and trading cards, grew 18.9%, or $196.4 million, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increase in store count and strong sales of new PC entertainment software and sales of accessories related to new hardware platforms. Cost of sales increased by $1,255.5 million, or 23.8%, from $5,280.3 million in fiscal 2007 to $6,535.8 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of the increase in sales and the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $456.4 million, or 25.2%, from $1,813.7 million in fiscal 2007 to $2,270.1 million in fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% in fiscal 2007 to 25.8% in fiscal 2008. The gross profit percentage increase was caused primarily by the shift in sales from new video game hardware to new video game software and used video game products as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2008 as the new platforms mature. These product categories carry a significantly higher margin than new video game hardware. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware decreased from 6.5% in fiscal 2007 to 6.1% in fiscal 2008 due primarily to a decrease in product replacement plan sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game software and other products remained relatively consistent from 20.8% and 33.9%, respectively, in fiscal 2007 compared to 20.9% and 33.6%, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products decreased from 48.7% in fiscal 2007 to 48.1% in fiscal 2008 due to increased promotional activities and higher refurbishment costs associated with an increase in production of refurbished hardware platforms during fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $263.4 million, or 22.3%, from $1,182.0 million in fiscal 2007 to $1,445.4 million in fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores in operation, and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from 16.7% in fiscal 2007 to 16.4% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leveraging as a result of the higher sales associated with the growth of the video game market and cost control efforts. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to ($6.4) million in fiscal 2008, compared to $8.6 million in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $130.3 million in fiscal 2007 to $145.0 million in fiscal 2008. This increase of $14.7 million was due primarily to capital expenditures associated with the opening of 674 new stores during fiscal 2008. 34 Table of Contents Interest income from the investment of excess cash balances decreased from $13.8 million in fiscal 2007 to $11.6 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of lower invested cash balances due to acquisitions and lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased from $61.6 million in fiscal 2007 to $50.5 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the retirement of $30.0 million of the Companys senior notes since February 2, 2008 and the retirement of $270.0 million in senior notes and senior floating rate notes during fiscal 2007. Debt extinguishment expense of $2.3 million and $12.6 million was recognized in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, as a result of the premiums paid related to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Income tax expense increased by $82.9 million, from $152.8 million in fiscal 2007 to $235.7 million in fiscal 2008. The Companys effective tax rate increased from 34.6% in fiscal 2007 to 37.2% in fiscal 2008 due to expenses related to mergers and acquisitions and associated corporate structuring and the deemed repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries. In addition, during fiscal 2007 there were valuation allowances released on foreign net operating losses. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $173.7 million, or 34.6%, from $501.4 million in fiscal 2007 to $675.1 million in fiscal 2008 and an increase in net earnings of $110.0 million, or 38.2%, from $288.3 million in fiscal 2007 to $398.3 million in fiscal 2008. Segment Performance The Company operates its business in the following segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance and how we divide management responsibility. Each of the segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and used video game systems, software and accessories which we refer to as video game products and PC entertainment software and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products in the various segments. Stores in all segments are similar in size at an average of approximately 1,400 square feet. As we have expanded our presence in international markets, the Company has increased its operations in foreign currencies, including the euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, and the Norwegian kroner. The notes issued in connection with the acquisition of Micromania and the EB merger are reflected in the United States segment. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Sales by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): 52 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended January 30, January 31, February 2, 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 6,275.0 $ 6,466.7 $ 5,438.8 Canada 491.4 548.2 473.0 Australia 530.2 520.0 420.8 Europe 1,781.4 1,271.0 761.4 Total $ 9,078.0 $ 8,805.9 $ 7,094.0 35 Table of Contents Operating earnings by operating segment, defined as income from continuing operations before intercompany royalty fees, net interest expense and income taxes, in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): 52 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks Ended Ended Ended January 30, January 31, February 2, 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 488.8 $ 530.1 $ 391.2 Canada 35.0 32.6 35.8 Australia 46.0 46.8 41.8 Europe 67.2 65.6 32.6 Total $ 637.0 $ 675.1 $ 501.4 Total assets by operating segment in U.S. dollars were as follows (in millions): January 30, January 31, February 2, 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 2,864.9 $ 2,592.5 $ 2,742.0 Canada 337.8 288.8 274.7 Australia 399.9 290.7 251.1 Europe 1,352.7 1,311.5 508.1 Total $ 4,955.3 $ 4,483.5 $ 3,775.9 Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 United States Segment results for the United States include retail operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam, the electronic commerce Web site www.gamestop.com and Game Informer Magazine. As of January 30, 2010, the United States segment included 4,429 GameStop stores, compared to 4,331 stores on January 31, 2009. Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 decreased 3.0% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 as a result of decreased sales at existing stores offset by the opening of 514 new stores since February 3, 2008, including 207 stores in the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010. Sales at existing stores decreased partially due to a decrease in consumer traffic as a result of the continued macroeconomic weakness and a slow down in hardware units sales, offset by an increase in used video game product sales due to an increase in the availability of hardware and software associated with the current generation of hardware platforms as those platforms age and expand. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 decreased by 7.8% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, driven by the decrease in sales and the deleveraging of the fixed components of selling, general and administrative expenses. Canada Sales in the Canadian segment in the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 decreased 10.4% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. The decrease in sales was primarily attributable to decreased sales at existing stores offset by the additional sales at the 47 stores opened since February 3, 2008. As of January 30, 2010, the Canadian segment had 337 stores compared to 325 stores as of January 31, 2009. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily due to weak consumer traffic and a slow down in hardware unit sell through. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 increased by 7.4% to $35.0 million compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. The increase in operating income when compared to the prior year was primarily due to the increase in gross margin, driven by the increase in used product sales and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates which had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $1.2 million when compared to fiscal 2008. 36 Table of Contents Australia Segment results for Australia include retail operations in Australia and New Zealand. As of January 30, 2010, the Australian segment included 388 stores, compared to 350 stores as of January 31, 2009. Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 increased 2.0% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. The increase in sales was due to the additional sales at the 112 stores opened since February 3, 2008 and the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates, which had the effect of increasing sales by $5.2 million, offset by a decrease in sales at existing stores. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily due to weak consumer traffic and a slow down in hardware unit sell through. Segment operating income in the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 decreased by 1.7% to $46.0 million when compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. The decrease in operating earnings for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 was due to the decrease in sales at existing stores and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation. Selling, general and administrative expenses will rise as a percentage of sales during periods of store count growth due to the fixed nature of many store expenses compared to the immature sales at new stores. This decrease in operating earnings was offset by the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates which had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $3.6 million when compared to fiscal 2008. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 13 European countries including France, in which we commenced operations on November 17, 2008 as a result of the Micromania acquisition. As of January 30, 2010, the European segment operated 1,296 stores, compared to 1,201 stores as of January 31, 2009. For the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, European sales increased 40.2% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. The increase in sales was primarily due to the additional sales at the 703 new and acquired stores opened since February 3, 2008, including the 328 stores from the Micromania acquisition in November 2008. This increase in sales was offset by the decrease in sales at existing stores and the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates recognized in fiscal 2009, which had the effect of decreasing sales by $15.3 million when compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in existing store sales was primarily driven by weak consumer traffic due to the continued macroeconomic weakness and a slow down in hardware unit sell through. The segment operating income in Europe for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 increased by 2.4% to $67.2 million compared to $65.6 million in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. The increase in the operating income was primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates which had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $5.2 million when compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating earnings excluding the exchange rate effect from fiscal 2008 was due to the decrease in sales at existing stores and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 United States As of January 31, 2009, the United States segment included 4,331 GameStop stores, compared to 4,061 stores on February 2, 2008. Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased 18.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 as a result of increased sales at existing stores and the opening of 643 new stores since February 3, 2007, including 315 stores in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009. Sales at existing stores increased due to strong sales of new video game software and used video game products which is typical in the years following the release of new hardware platforms. As the installed base of the new hardware platforms expands, more new software titles become available and trade ins of used video game products applied toward the purchase of new video games lead to increased sales of new and used video game products. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased by 35.5% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008, driven by strong sales of new video game software and used video game products and their related accessories, as well as the leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses. 37 Table of Contents Canada Sales in the Canadian segment in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased 15.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to increased sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 58 stores opened since February 3, 2007. As of January 31, 2009, the Canadian segment had 325 stores compared to 287 stores as of February 2, 2008. The increase in sales at existing stores was driven by strong sales of new video game software related to the continued expansion of the installed base of new hardware platforms. Segment operating income for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 decreased by 8.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The decrease in operating income when compared to the prior year was due primarily to a lower gross margin percentage driven by economic issues and competitive issues stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates. For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, changes in exchange rates when compared to the prior year had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $2.7 million. Australia As of January 31, 2009, the Australian segment included 350 stores, compared to 280 stores as of February 2, 2008. Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased 23.6% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in sales was due to higher sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 133 stores opened since February 3, 2007. The increase in sales at existing stores was due to a strong video game software title lineup and the availability of the new hardware platforms in fiscal 2008 when compared to the prior fiscal year following the launch of the Sony PlayStation 3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, the new hardware platforms drove an increase in used product sales as the installed base of platforms increased and more software became available. Segment operating income in the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased by 12.0% when compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in operating earnings for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 was due to the higher sales and related gross margin offset by the higher selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation and the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates since the prior year. For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, changes in exchange rates when compared to the prior year had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $4.0 million. Europe As of January 31, 2009, the European segment operated 1,201 stores, compared to 636 stores as of February 2, 2008. For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, European sales increased 66.9% compared to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in sales was primarily due to the additional sales at the 754 stores opened since February 3, 2007, including the 328 stores from the Micromania acquisition and the 49 stores acquired from Free Record Shop Norway AS, a Norwegian private limited liability company (FRS), in Norway during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the increase in sales at existing stores. The increase in sales at existing stores was due to strong sales of new video game software and the availability of the new hardware platforms in fiscal 2008 when compared to the prior fiscal year following the launch of the Sony PlayStation 3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, the new hardware platforms drove an increase in used product sales as the installed base of the platforms increased and more software became available. The segment operating income in Europe for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 increased to $65.6 million compared to $32.6 million in the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008. The increase in the operating income was driven by the increase in sales and related margin dollars discussed above, the earnings generated by the Micromania stores and the continued maturation of our operations in the rest of the European market, offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates since the prior year. For the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009, changes in exchange rates when compared to fiscal 2007 had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $3.3 million. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows During fiscal 2009, cash provided by operations was $644.2 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $549.2 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in cash provided by operations of $95.0 million from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by the decrease in inventory, net of the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the increase in income taxes payable and deferred taxes, as well as the changes in the adjustment related to the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards which decreased by $34.5 million. The decrease in net inventory was primarily due to lower overall purchases during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued macroeconomic weakness and our efforts to effectively manage inventory levels. Inventory turnover also decreased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the growth in the international segments which have lower inventory turns compared to the United States segment due to their lower overall store count and multiple warehouse facilities. The increase in cash related to income taxes payable and deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the timing of the recognition of deferred income tax items and the timing of estimated income tax payments at the end of fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, cash provided by operations was $549.2 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $494.0 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in cash provided by operations of $55.2 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by net earnings of $110.0 million, and a decrease in the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards of $59.1 million. These amounts were offset by an increase in cash used in operations related to an increase in inventory, net of the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and higher payments for income taxes due to the higher net income in fiscal 2008. The increase in merchandise inventories in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in store count and sales levels. Cash used in investing activities was $187.2 million in fiscal 2009, $820.9 million during fiscal 2008 and $176.6 million during fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2009, the Company used $178.9 million for capital expenditures primarily to open 388 new stores and to invest in information systems. In addition, the Company used $8.4 million on acquisitions. During fiscal 2008, the Company used $580.4 million, net of cash acquired, to purchase Micromania and $50.3 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire FRS, The Gamesman Limited and an increased ownership interest in GameStop Group Limited. In addition, during fiscal 2008, $190.2 million of cash was used for capital expenditures primarily to open 674 new stores and to invest in information systems. During fiscal 2007, $177.7 million of cash was used for capital expenditures primarily to open 586 stores and to invest in information systems. Cash used in financing activities was $154.4 million in fiscal 2009. Cash provided by financing activities was $29.6 million in fiscal 2008 and cash used in financing activities was $124.2 million in fiscal 2007. The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2009 were primarily for the repurchase of $100.0 million in principal amount of the Companys senior notes and the purchase of $58.4 million of treasury shares pursuant to the Board of Directors $300 million authorization in January 2010. The cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal 2008 were due to cash received related to the issuance of shares associated with stock option exercises of $29.0 million and for the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards of $34.2 million. These cash inflows were offset by the repurchase of $30.0 million in principal amount of the Companys senior notes. In addition, the Company borrowed $425.0 million related to the acquisition of Micromania and subsequently repaid the balance before the end of fiscal 2008. The cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the repurchase of $20.0 million and $250.0 million in principal amount of the Companys senior notes and senior floating rate notes, respectively, and the $12.2 million principal payment made in October 2007 on the Barnes Noble promissory note. These cash outflows were offset by $64.9 million received for the issuance of shares relating to stock option exercises and $93.3 million for the realization of tax benefits relating to the exercise of stock based awards. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various growth initiatives. Our cash and cash 39 Table of Contents equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value, and consist primarily of time deposits with highly rated commercial banks and money market investment funds holding direct U.S. Treasury obligations. In October 2005, in connection with the EB merger, the Company entered into a five year, $400 million Credit Agreement (the Revolver), including a $50 million letter of credit sub limit, secured by the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. In April 2007, the Company amended the Revolver to extend the maturity date from October 11, 2010 to April 25, 2012, reduce the LIBO interest rate margin, reduce and fix the rate of the unused commitment fee and modify or delete certain other covenants. The extension of the Revolver to 2012 reduces our exposure to the current tightening in the credit markets. The availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (x) approximately 70% of eligible inventory and (y) 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 85% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Companys ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options, and repurchase shares is generally prohibited, except that if availability under the Revolver is or will be after any such payment equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base, the Company may repurchase its capital stock and pay cash dividends. In addition, in the event that credit extensions under the Revolver at any time exceed 80% of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.5:1.0. The per annum interest rate on the Revolver is variable and, at the Companys option, is calculated by applying a margin of (1) 0.0% to 0.25% above the higher of the prime rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (2) 1.00% to 1.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. As of January 30, 2010, the applicable margin was 0.0% for prime rate loans and 1.00% for LIBO rate loans. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. During the 2009 fiscal year, the Company borrowed and repaid $115.0 million under the Revolver. As of January 30, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding totaled $8.8 million. In September 2007, the Companys Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the Line of Credit) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit will be made available to the Companys foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of January 30, 2010, there were no cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $16.0 million. In September 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. as co issuer (together with the Company, the Issuers), completed the offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes and, together with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the Notes). The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated September 28, 2005 (the Indenture), by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee). The net proceeds of the offering were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to the stockholders of EB in connection with the EB merger. In November 2006, Wilmington Trust Company was appointed as the new Trustee for the Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum, mature on October 1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a discount at the time of issue of $8.5 million. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest method. As of January 30, 2010, the unamortized original issue discount was $2.7 million. The Issuers pay interest on the Senior Notes semi annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. The Indenture contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, limitations on (1) the incurrence of additional debt, (2) restricted payments, (3) liens, (4) sale and 40 Table of Contents leaseback transactions and (5) asset sales. Events of default provided for in the Indenture include, among other things, failure to pay interest or principal on the Notes, other breaches of covenants in the Indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. As of January 30, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Revolver and the Indenture. Under certain conditions, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions prior to maturity redeem up to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issued under the Indenture at redemption prices at or in excess of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The circumstances which would limit the percentage of the Notes which may be redeemed or which would require the Company to pay a premium in excess of 100% of the principal amount are defined in the Indenture. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers are required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The Issuers may acquire Senior Notes by means other than redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisitions do not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. In November 2008, in connection with the acquisition of Micromania, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC. The Term Loan Agreement provided for term loans (Term Loans) in the aggregate of $150.0 million, consisting of a $50.0 million secured term loan (Term Loan A) and a $100.0 million unsecured term loan (Term Loan B). The effective interest rate on Term Loan A was 5.75% per annum and the effective rate on Term Loan B ranged from 5.0% to 5.75% per annum. In addition to the $150.0 million under the Term Loans, the Company borrowed $275.0 million under the Revolver to complete the acquisition of Micromania in November 2008. As of January 31, 2009, the Revolver and the Term Loans were repaid in full. As of January 31, 2009 and January 30, 2010, the only long term debt outstanding was the Senior Notes. Uses of Capital Our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened 388 stores in fiscal 2009. We expect to open approximately 400 stores in fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are projected to be approximately $215 million, to be used primarily to fund new store openings and invest in distribution and information systems in support of operations. Between May 2006 and September 2009, the Company repurchased and redeemed the $300 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes and $200 million of Senior Notes under previously announced buybacks authorized by its Board of Directors. All of the authorized amounts were repurchased or redeemed and the repurchased Notes were delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on the retirement of debt was $5.3 million, $2.3 million and $12.6 million for the 52 week periods ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, which consisted of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. The changes in the carrying amount of the Senior Notes for the Company for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2009 and the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010 were as follows, in millions: Balance at February 2, 2008 $ 574.5 Repurchase of Senior Notes, net (28.8 ) Balance at January 31, 2009 $ 545.7 Repurchase of Senior Notes, net (98.4 ) Balance at January 30, 2010 $ 447.3 In October 2004, GameStop issued a promissory note in favor of Barnes Noble in the principal amount of $74.0 million in connection with the repurchase of GameStops common stock held by Barnes Noble. The note 41 Table of Contents was unsecured and bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable with each principal installment. The final scheduled principal payment of $12.2 million was made in October 2007, satisfying the promissory note in full. We used cash to expand the Company through acquisitions during fiscal 2008. On April 5, 2008, the Company purchased all the outstanding stock of FRS for $21.0 million, net of cash acquired. FRS operated 49 record stores in Norway and also operated office and warehouse facilities in Oslo, Norway. The Company converted these stores into video game stores with an inventory assortment similar to its other stores in Norway. In 2003, the Company purchased a 51% controlling interest in GameStop Group Limited which operates stores in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the minority interest owners of the remaining 49% have the ability to require the Company to purchase their remaining shares in incremental percentages at a price to be determined based partially on the Companys price to earnings ratio and GameStop Group Limiteds earnings. In June 2008, the minority interest owners exercised their right to sell one third of their shares, or approximately 16% of GameStop Group Limited, to the Company under the terms of the original purchase agreement for $27.4 million. In July 2009, an additional 16% was purchased for $4.7 million, bringing the Companys total interest in GameStop Group Limited to approximately 84%. On November 17, 2008, GameStop France SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of GameStop, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of SFMI Micromania from its shareholders for approximately $580.4 million, net of cash acquired. Micromania is a leading retailer of video and computer games in France with 368 stores as of January 30, 2010. The Company funded the transaction with cash on hand, a draw on the Revolver totaling $275.0 million, and the Term Loans. On November 4, 2009, the Company purchased a controlling interest in Omac Global Medial Limited, an online video game developer and operator, as part of the Companys overall digital growth strategy. The acquisition in the amount of $3.8 million was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired, in the amount of $3.8 million, recorded as goodwill. On January 11, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $300 million share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock. For fiscal 2009, the number of shares repurchased were 6.1 million for an average price per share of $20.12. Approximately $64.6 million of treasury share purchases were not settled at the end of fiscal 2009 and have been reported in accrued liabilities. Since the end of fiscal 2009, the Company has purchased an additional 6.5 million shares for an average price per share of $19.03. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our operations, required payments on the Senior Notes, store expansion and remodeling activities and corporate capital expenditure programs for at least the next 12 months. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of January 30, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Long Term Debt(1) $ 558.0 $ 36.0 $ 522.0 $ $ Operating Leases 1,265.5 338.7 511.2 260.7 154.9 Purchase Obligations(2) 849.5 849.5 Total $ 2,673.0 $ 1,224.2 $ 1,033.2 $ 260.7 $ 154.9 (1) The long term debt consists of $450.0 million (principal value), which bears interest at 8.0% per annum. Amounts include contractual interest payments. (2) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. 42 Table of Contents In addition to minimum rentals, the operating leases generally require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs and may provide for percentage rentals. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term, including renewal options for those leases in which it is reasonably assured that the Company will exercise the renewal option. The Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding. The Company has entered into employment agreements with R. Richard Fontaine, Executive Chairman, Daniel A. DeMatteo, Chief Executive Officer, J. Paul Raines, Chief Operating Officer and Tony D. Bartel, Executive Vice President Merchandising and Marketing. The terms of the employment agreements with Messrs. Fontaine and DeMatteo commenced on April 11, 2005 and continued for a period of three years thereafter and were automatically renewed in April 2008 and April 2009 for an additional year each. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Raines commenced on September 7, 2008 and continues for a period of three years thereafter. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Bartel commenced on October 24, 2008 and continues for a period of three years thereafter. Each of these employment agreements contains provisions for automatic annual renewals unless either party gives notice of non renewal at least six months prior to expiration. The employment agreements for Messrs. Fontaine and DeMatteo will automatically renew in April 2010 for a period of one year as no notice of non renewal was given. Each of the employment agreements was amended and restated on December 31, 2008 to bring them into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The minimum annual salaries during the term of employment under the amended and restated employment agreements for Messrs. Fontaine, DeMatteo, Raines and Bartel shall be no less than $650,000, $535,000, $900,000 and $400,000, respectively. The Board of Directors of the Company has set Messrs. Fontaines, DeMatteos, Raines and Bartels annual salaries for fiscal 2010 at $1,200,000, $1,250,000, $950,000 and $610,000, respectively. As of January 30, 2010, we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $8.8 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $16.0 million, $9.5 million of which are cash collateralized. As of January 30, 2010, the Company had $35.2 million of income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. In 2003, the Company purchased a 51% controlling interest in GameStop Group Limited, which operates stores in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the minority interest owners have the ability to require the Company to purchase their remaining shares in incremental percentages at a price to be determined based partially on the Companys price to earnings ratio and GameStop Group Limiteds earnings. Shares representing 16% were purchased in June 2008 and an additional 16% was purchased in July 2009, bringing the Companys total interest in GameStop Group Limited to approximately 84%. The Company already consolidates the results of GameStop Group Limited; therefore, any additional amounts acquired will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 30, 2010, the Company had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S K. Impact of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Certain Relationships and Related Transactions The Company operates departments within seven bookstores operated by Barnes Noble, a related party through a common stockholder who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Barnes Noble and a member of the Companys Board of Directors. The Company pays a license fee to Barnes Noble on the gross sales of such departments. The Company deems the license fee to be reasonable and based upon terms equivalent to those that would prevail in an arms length transaction. During the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, these charges amounted to $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. In May 2005, the Company entered into an arrangement with Barnes Noble under which www.gamestop.com became the exclusive specialty video game retailer listed on www.bn.com, Barnes Nobles e commerce site. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company pays a fee to Barnes Noble for sales of video game or PC entertainment products sold through www.bn.com. The fee paid to Barnes Noble in connection with this arrangement was $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. Until June 2005, GameStop participated in Barnes Nobles workers compensation, property and general liability insurance programs. The costs incurred by Barnes Noble under these programs were allocated to GameStop based upon total payroll expense, property and equipment, and insurance claim history of GameStop. Management deemed the allocation methodology to be reasonable. Although the Company secured its own insurance coverage, costs will likely continue to be incurred by Barnes Noble on insurance claims which were incurred under its programs prior to June 2005 and any such costs applicable to insurance claims against GameStop will be allocated to the Company. During the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, these allocated charges amounted to $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The Company had a promissory note in the favor of Barnes Noble in the principal amount of $74.0 million, in connection with the repurchase of the Companys common stock held by Barnes Noble in October 2004. The note was unsecured and bore interest at 5.5% per annum, payable with each principal installment. The final scheduled principal payment of $12.2 million was made in October 2007 and the note has been satisfied in full. Interest expense on the promissory note for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2008 totaled $0.4 million. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB codified accounting literature into a single source of authoritative principles, except for certain authoritative rules and interpretive releases issued by the SEC which are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants, which became effective for our Company in August 2009. Since the codification did not alter existing U.S. GAAP, it did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. All references to pre codified U.S. GAAP have been removed from this Form 10 K. In March 2008, the FASB amended existing disclosure requirements related to derivative and hedging activities, which became effective for the Company on February 1, 2009 and are being applied prospectively. As a result of the amended disclosure requirements, the Company is required to provide expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities in each interim and annual period. The adoption of the new disclosure requirements had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB amended its guidance on accounting for business combinations. The new accounting guidance amends the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. It also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The new accounting guidance resulted in a change in our accounting policy effective February 1, 2009, and is being applied prospectively to all business combinations subsequent to the effective date. The adoption of this new accounting policy did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and the impact that its adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements in future periods will depend on the nature and size of business combinations completed subsequent to the date of adoption. 44 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting and disclosure guidance related to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries (previously referred to as minority interests), which resulted in a change to our accounting policy effective February 1, 2009. The new guidance requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between controlling and noncontrolling interests and requires the separate disclosure of income attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests. The new accounting guidance is being applied prospectively. The adoption of this new accounting policy did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. However, in February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the new accounting guidance for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of this new accounting guidance for our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on February 1, 2009 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term, highly liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. In addition, the Senior Notes outstanding carry a fixed interest rate. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances, and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest. Foreign Currency Risk The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps (together, the Foreign Currency Contracts) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. For the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010, the Company recognized an $8.7 million gain in selling, general and administrative expenses related to the trading of derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of the Foreign Currency Contracts as of January 30, 2010 was a net asset of $11.1 million as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, and industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the Foreign Currency Contracts from the market rate as of January 30, 2010 would result in a (loss) or gain in value of the forwards, options and swaps of ($35.6) million or $35.6 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. The Company manages counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of 45 Table of Contents different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements.
