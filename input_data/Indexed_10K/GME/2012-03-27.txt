Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto. Statements regarding future economic performance, managements plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward looking statements. Certain factors, which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements, accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including the factors disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors. General GameStop Corp. (together with its predecessor companies, GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company) is the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer. We sell new and used video game hardware, physical and digital video game software, accessories, as well as PC entertainment software and other merchandise primarily through our GameStop, EB Games and Micromania stores. As of January 28, 2012, we operated 6,683 stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, which are primarily located in major shopping malls and strip centers. We also operate electronic commerce Web sites www.gamestop.com, www.ebgames.com.au, www.gamestop.ca, www.gamestop.it, www.gamestop.es, www.gamestop.ie, www.gamestop.de, www.gamestop.co.uk and www.micromania.fr. The network also includes: www.kongregate.com, a leading browser based game site; Game Informer magazine, the leading multi platform video game publication; Spawn Labs, a streaming technology company; and a digital PC distribution platform available at www.gamestop.com/pcgames. Our fiscal year is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 28, 2012 (fiscal 2011), January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2010) and January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2009) consisted of 52 weeks. Growth in the video game industry is generally driven by the introduction of new technology. The current generation of hardware consoles (the Sony PlayStation 3, the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii) were introduced between 2005 and 2007. The Nintendo DSi XL was introduced in early 2010 and the Nintendo 3DS was introduced in March 2011. Typically, following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of new video game hardware increase as a percentage of total sales in the first full year following introduction. As video game platforms mature, the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories, which generate higher gross margins, generally increases in the subsequent years. The net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the years subsequent to the first full year following the launch period. Unit sales of maturing video game platforms 29 Table of Contents are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price reductions, further driving sales of related software and accessories. New hardware systems are typically introduced every four to six years. The current generation of hardware is now between five and six years old and consumer demand is waning. We expect to see declines in hardware sales in fiscal 2012 and related declines in software sales. We expect that future growth in the video game industry will also be driven by the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of gaming. We currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including digitally downloaded software, Xbox LIVE, PlayStation and Nintendo network point cards, as well as prepaid digital and online timecards. We expect our sales of digital products to increase in fiscal 2012. We have made significant investments in e commerce, online game development, digital kiosks and in store and Web site functionality to enable our customers to access digital content and eliminate friction in the digital sales and delivery process. We plan to continue to invest in these types of processes and channels to grow our digital sales base and enhance our market leadership position in the video game industry and in the digital aggregation and distribution category. We also intend to continue to invest in customer loyalty programs designed to attract and retain customers. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events: Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the Companys financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time of sale, net of sales discounts, reduced by a provision for sales returns. Our sales return reserve, which represents the gross profit effect of sales returns, is estimated based on historical return levels. The sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer. Advertising revenues for Game Informer are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers. Subscription revenues for the Companys PowerUp Rewards loyalty program and magazines are recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period. Revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period. Gift cards sold to customers are recognized as a liability on the balance sheet until redeemed. The Company sells a variety of digital products which generally allow consumers to download software or play games on the internet. Certain of these products do not require the Company to purchase inventory or take physical possession of, or take title to, inventory. When purchasing these products from the Company, consumers pay a retail price and the Company earns a commission based on a percentage of the retail sale as negotiated with the product publisher. The Company recognizes this commission as revenue on the sale of these digital products. Stock Based Compensation. The Company records share based compensation expense in earnings based on the grant date fair value of options or restricted stock granted. As of January 28, 2012, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options and restricted stock was $2.8 million and $10.9 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 and 1.7 years, respectively. Note 1 and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information on stock based compensation. 30 Table of Contents Merchandise Inventories. Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on hand and this amount is re averaged over the cumulative units. Used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer. In valuing inventory, management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market. Management considers quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections and returns to vendors, among other factors, when making these assumptions. Our ability to gauge these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well balanced merchandise assortment. Any inability to forecast customer demand properly could lead to increased costs associated with inventory markdowns. We also adjust inventory based on anticipated physical inventory losses or shrinkage. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis to ensure the reported inventory is accurate. During interim periods, estimates of shrinkage are recorded based on historical losses in the context of current period circumstances. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives (ranging from two to eight years). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including renewal options in which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured (generally ranging from three to ten years). Costs incurred to third parties in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational. The Company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including managements intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected cash flows. Impairment losses recorded by the Company in fiscal 2011 were $11.2 million. Impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were $1.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Goodwill. Goodwill, aggregating $2,019.0 million, has been recorded as of January 28, 2012 related to various acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company is required to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually. This test is completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired. Goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. The Company has four business segments, the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, which also define our reporting units based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations within each segment, including the nature of products, product distribution and the type of customer and separate management within those regions. The Company estimates fair value based on the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit. The Company uses a two step process to measure goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is higher than its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value, then the second test of goodwill impairment is needed. The second test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite lived intangible asset is written down by the amount of the excess. The Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired. For the fiscal 2011 impairment test, for each of the reporting units, the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than ten percent. For fiscal 2011, there was a $3.3 million goodwill 31 Table of Contents impairment charge in the United States segment as a result of the exiting of a non core business. Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information concerning goodwill. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of reporting units. Management is required to make significant judgments based on the Companys projected annual business plans, long term business strategies, comparable store sales, store count, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs, capital expenditures and long term growth rates, all considered in light of current and anticipated economic factors. Discount rates used in the analysis reflect a hypothetical market participants weighted average cost of capital, current market rates and the risks associated with the projected cash flows. The impairment testing process is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity, particularly related to sales and gross margins which can be impacted by various factors including the items listed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. While the fair value is determined based on the best available information at the time of assessment, any changes in business or economic conditions could materially increase or decrease the fair value of the reporting units net assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge. While the Company does not anticipate any material changes to the projected undiscounted cash flows underlying its impairment test, many other factors impact the fair value calculation. Since we are required to determine fair value from a hypothetical market participants perspective, discount rates used in the analyses may change based on market conditions, regardless of whether the Companys cost of capital has changed, which could negatively impact the fair value calculation. As we periodically reassess our fair value calculations using currently available market information and internal forecasts, changes in our judgments and other assumptions could result in recording material impairment charges of goodwill or other intangible assets in any of the Companys reporting units in the future. Other Intangible Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets. Other intangible assets consist primarily of trade names, leasehold rights, advertising relationships and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests recorded primarily as a result of the acquisition of SFMI Micromania SAS (Micromania) and the merger with Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. (the EB merger). We record intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from a contractual right and are capable of being separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged individually. The useful life and amortization methodology of intangible assets are determined based on the period in which they are expected to contribute directly to cash flows. Trade names which were recorded as a result of acquisitions, primarily Micromania, are considered indefinite lived intangible assets as they are expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and are not subject to amortization, but they are subject to annual impairment testing. Leasehold rights which were recorded as a result of the Micromania acquisition represent the value of rights of tenancy under commercial property leases for properties located in France. Rights pertaining to individual leases can be sold by us to a new tenant or recovered by us from the landlord if the exercise of the automatic right of renewal is refused. Leasehold rights are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term not to exceed 20 years with no residual value. Advertising relationships, which were recorded as a result of digital acquisitions, are relationships with existing advertisers who pay to place ads on the Companys digital Web sites and are amortized on a straight line basis over 10 years. Favorable leasehold interests represent the value of the contractual monthly rental payments that are less than the current market rent at stores acquired as part of the Micromania acquisition or the EB merger. Favorable leasehold interests are amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining lease term with no expected residual value. For additional information related to the Companys intangible assets, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other non current assets are made up of deposits and deferred financing fees. The deferred financing fees are associated with the Companys revolving credit facility and the senior notes issued in October 2005 in connection with the financing of the EB merger. The senior notes were redeemed in fiscal 2011. The remaining deferred financing fees with respect to the revolving credit facility are being amortized over five years to match the term of the revolving credit facility. Indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This test is completed as 32 Table of Contents of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the intangible assets might be impaired. Similar to the test for goodwill impairment discussed above, the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of our Micromania trade name is calculated using a relief from royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future cash flow projections are internal revenue forecasts, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions, to which the selected royalty rate is applied. These future cash flows are discounted using the applicable discount rate, as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The primary uncertainties in this calculation are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate and assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth forecasts, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in developing the discount rate. The Company completed its annual impairment tests of indefinite lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 and concluded that none of its intangible assets were impaired. The Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and concluded that its Micromania trade name was impaired due to revenue forecasts that have declined since the initial valuation. As a result, the Company recorded a $37.8 million impairment charge for fiscal 2011. Cash Consideration Received from Vendors. The Company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the Company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases. The Company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet. Because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year, the Company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods, including estimates of full year vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory. Estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases. Determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances, specific, incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs, merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known. Although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective, we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances. In addition, management believes that the Companys revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances, but management is unable to quantify the impact. Loyalty Program. The PowerUp Rewards loyalty program allows enrolled members to earn points on purchases in the Companys stores and on some of the Companys Web sites that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts or merchandise. The Company estimates the net cost of the rewards that will be issued and redeemed and records this cost and the associated balance sheet reserve as points are accumulated by loyalty program members. The two primary estimates utilized to record the balance sheet reserve for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated redemption rate and the estimated weighted average cost per point redeemed. Management uses historical redemption rates experienced under the 33 Table of Contents loyalty program, prior experience with other customer incentives and data on other similar loyalty programs as a basis to estimate the ultimate redemption rate of points earned. A weighted average cost per point redeemed is used to estimate future redemption costs. The weighted average cost per point redeemed is based on the Companys most recent actual costs incurred to fulfill points that have been redeemed by its loyalty program members and is adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including the mix of rewards redeemed. The Company continually evaluates its reserve methodology and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed and other factors. Changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point redeemed have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. Lease Accounting. The Companys method of accounting for rent expense (and related deferred rent liability) and leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) is in conformance with GAAP. For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which we are reasonably assured of exercising lease options, and we include in the lease term any period during which the Company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed, or rent holiday. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability approach, and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our Company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction. We file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations. However, complexities in the tax rules and our operations, as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities, may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required. In accordance with GAAP, we maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount. 34 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain statement of operations items as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated: 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 28,2012 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 29,2011 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 30,2010 Statement of Operations Data: Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 71.9 73.2 73.2 Gross profit 28.1 26.8 26.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 19.3 18.0 18.0 Depreciation and amortization 2.0 1.8 1.8 Asset impairments and restructuring charges 0.8 Operating earnings 6.0 7.0 7.0 Interest expense, net 0.2 0.4 0.4 Debt extinguishment expense 0.1 Earnings before income taxes 5.8 6.6 6.5 Income tax expense 2.2 2.3 2.4 Consolidated net income 3.6 4.3 4.1 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.1 Consolidated net income attributable to GameStop 3.6 % 4.3 % 4.2 % The Company includes purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, rather than in cost of sales, in the statement of operations. The Company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales, rather than selling, general and administrative expenses, in the statement of operations. As a result of these classifications, our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing, receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling, general and administrative expenses. The net effect of these classifications as a percentage of sales has not historically been material. The following table sets forth sales (in millions) by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2012 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 29,2011 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 30,2010 Sales Percentof Total Sales Percentof Total Sales Percentof Total Sales: New video game hardware $ 1,611.6 16.9 % $ 1,720.0 18.1 % $ 1,756.5 19.3 % New video game software 4,048.2 42.4 % 3,968.7 41.9 % 3,730.9 41.1 % Used video game products 2,620.2 27.4 % 2,469.8 26.1 % 2,394.1 26.4 % Other 1,270.5 13.3 % 1,315.2 13.9 % 1,196.5 13.2 % Total $ 9,550.5 100.0 % $ 9,473.7 100.0 % $ 9,078.0 100.0 % Other products include PC entertainment and other software, digital products and currency, accessories and revenues associated with Game Informer magazine and the Companys PowerUp Rewards program. 35 Table of Contents The following table sets forth gross profit (in millions) and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated: 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2012 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 29,2011 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 30,2010 GrossProfit GrossProfitPercent GrossProfit GrossProfitPercent GrossProfit GrossProfitPercent Gross Profit: New video game hardware $ 113.6 7.0 % $ 124.9 7.3 % $ 113.5 6.5 % New video game software 839.0 20.7 % 819.6 20.7 % 795.0 21.3 % Used video game products 1,221.2 46.6 % 1,140.5 46.2 % 1,121.2 46.8 % Other 505.7 39.8 % 452.6 34.4 % 405.0 33.8 % Total $ 2,679.5 28.1 % $ 2,537.6 26.8 % $ 2,434.7 26.8 % Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Sales increased $76.8 million, or 0.8%, to $9,550.5 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2011 compared to $9,473.7 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2010. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates, which had the effect of increasing sales by $140.2 million when compared to the 52 weeks of fiscal 2010 and the increase of non comparable store sales from the increase in net store count of 233 stores since January 30, 2010, offset partially by a decrease in comparable store sales of 2.1%. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily due to a decrease in comparable new video game hardware sales as the current generation of hardware platforms continues to age. Stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation and exclude the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. New video game hardware sales decreased $108.4 million, or 6.3%, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a decrease in hardware unit sell through, primarily in the Nintendo Wii and handheld categories, partially offset by the launch of the Nintendo 3DS. New video game software sales increased $79.5 million, or 2.0%, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011, primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Used video game product sales increased $150.4 million, or 6.1%, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased promotional efforts using our PowerUp Rewards program and changes in merchandising. Sales of other product categories decreased $44.7 million, or 3.4%, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The decrease in other product sales was primarily due to the decrease in sales of new release PC entertainment software titles and the shift in digital sales from inventoriable pre purchased product, recorded as revenue at the retail price, to non inventoriable digitally downloadable content, recorded as revenue on a commission basis, offset partially by changes in foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of sales, new video game software sales and used video game product sales increased, while new video game hardware sales and other product sales decreased, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The change in the mix of sales was primarily due to the increase in used video game product sales as discussed above and the decrease in new video game hardware sales due to the continued aging of the current generation of hardware platforms. Cost of sales decreased by $65.1 million, or 0.9%, from $6,936.1 million in fiscal 2010 to $6,871.0 million in fiscal 2011 as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $141.9 million, or 5.6%, from $2,537.6 million in fiscal 2010 to $2,679.5 million in fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.8% in fiscal 2010 and 28.1% in fiscal 2011. The gross profit percentage increase was primarily due to the increase in sales of used video game products as a percentage of total sales and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products, including the increase in 36 Table of Contents sales of digital products, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware decreased slightly from 7.3% in fiscal 2010 to 7.0% in fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game software stayed constant at 20.7% for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products increased from 46.2% in fiscal 2010 to 46.6% in fiscal 2011 due to decreased promotional activities in the holiday selling season. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on the other product sales category increased from 34.4% in fiscal 2010 to 39.8% in fiscal 2011 primarily due to a shift in sales to higher margin digital products, some of which are recorded on a commission basis at 100% margin, and growth in sales of PowerUp Rewards Pro memberships and related Game Informer subscriptions that also have higher margins than PC entertainment software and accessories. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $143.3 million, or 8.4%, from $1,698.8 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,842.1 million in fiscal 2011. This increase was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates which had the effect of increasing expenses by $29.0 million when compared to fiscal 2010, as well as additional expenses incurred in support of our digital and loyalty initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 18.0% in the fiscal 2010 to 19.3% in fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to deleveraging of fixed costs as a result of the decrease in comparable store sales and the additional expenses incurred in support of our digital and loyalty initiatives in fiscal 2011. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are $18.8 million and $29.6 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.6 million from $174.7 million in fiscal 2010 to $186.3 million in fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to the capital expenditures associated with the opening of 285 new stores during fiscal 2011 and investments in management information systems, including investments in digital and loyalty initiatives. During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded asset impairments and restructuring charges of $81.2 million. These charges were primarily due to impairment of the Companys Micromania trade name in France and impairment and disposal costs related to the exit of non core businesses, primarily a small retail movie chain of stores owned by the Company until fiscal 2011. Restructuring costs include disposal and exit costs related to the exit of underperforming regions in Europe and consolidation of home office and back office functions, as well as impairment and store closure costs primarily in the international segments. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances decreased from $1.8 million in fiscal 2010 to $0.9 million in fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower invested cash balances and lower interest rates during fiscal 2011. Interest expense decreased from $37.0 million in fiscal 2010 to $20.7 million in fiscal 2011, primarily due to the redemption of $250.0 and $200.0 million of the Companys senior notes during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Debt extinguishment expense of $1.0 million was recognized in fiscal 2011 as a result of the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Debt extinguishment expense of $6.0 million was recognized in fiscal 2010 as a result of premiums paid related to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Income tax expense decreased by $4.0 million, from $214.6 million in fiscal 2010 to $210.6 million in fiscal 2011. The Companys effective tax rate increased from 34.5% in fiscal 2010 to 38.4% in fiscal 2011 due primarily to the variability in the accounting for the Companys uncertain tax positions and the effect of asset impairments and restructuring charges on the tax rate in fiscal 2011 due to certain charges which have no tax benefits. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to a decrease in operating earnings of $92.7 million, or 14.0%, from $662.6 million in fiscal 2010 to $569.9 million in fiscal 2011 and a decrease in consolidated net income of $68.3 million, or 16.8%, from $406.8 million in fiscal 2010 to $338.5 million in fiscal 2011. 37 Table of Contents The $1.4 million and $1.2 million net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively, represents the portion of the minority interest stockholders net loss of the Companys non wholly owned subsidiaries included in the Companys consolidated net income. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Sales increased $395.7 million, or 4.4%, to $9,473.7 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2010 compared to $9,078.0 million in the 52 weeks of fiscal 2009. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to the addition of non comparable store sales from the 747 stores opened since January 31, 2009, and an increase in comparable store sales of 1.1%. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily due to strong sales of new video game and PC entertainment titles in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. New video game hardware sales decreased $36.5 million, or 2.1%, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010, primarily due to a decrease in hardware unit sell through, primarily in the Nintendo Wii and DSi and Sony PSP, and price cuts which resulted in lower per unit sales, partially offset by the additional sales at new stores added since fiscal 2009. New video game hardware sales decreased as a percentage of sales from 19.3% in fiscal 2009 to 18.1% in fiscal 2010, primarily due to the slow down in hardware unit sell through as the new platforms mature, as well as price decreases initiated by the manufacturers in fiscal 2009. New video game software sales increased $237.8 million, or 6.4%, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010, primarily due to strong sales of new video game titles released in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009, as well as sales from new stores added since fiscal 2009. New video game software sales increased as a percentage of total sales from 41.1% in fiscal 2009 to 41.9% in fiscal 2010, primarily due to the new release sales growth and the slow down in hardware unit sell through discussed above. Used video game product sales increased $75.7 million, or 3.2%, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010, primarily due to the increase in the availability of hardware and software associated with the current generation hardware platforms as those platforms age and expand and the additional sales at new stores added since fiscal 2009. As a percentage of sales, used video game product sales decreased from 26.4% to 26.1%, primarily due to the increase in new release video game software sales and other product sales. Sales of other product categories, including PC entertainment and other software and accessories, increased 9.9%, or $118.7 million, from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010, primarily due to stronger sales of newly released PC entertainment software titles in fiscal 2010 and an increase in revenue associated with the Companys loyalty program. Cost of sales increased by $292.8 million, or 4.4%, from $6,643.3 million in fiscal 2009 to $6,936.1 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of the increase in sales and the changes in gross profit discussed below. Gross profit increased by $102.9 million, or 4.2%, from $2,434.7 million in fiscal 2009 to $2,537.6 million in fiscal 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.8% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game hardware increased from 6.5% in fiscal 2009 to 7.3% in fiscal 2010 due primarily to an increase in product replacement plan sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on new video game software decreased from 21.3% in fiscal 2009 to 20.7% in fiscal 2010, primarily due to a decrease in vendor allowances received, net of advertising expenses. Advertising expenses increased, due in part to expenses associated with the Companys new loyalty program. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products decreased from 46.8% in fiscal 2009 to 46.2% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to promotional activities in the holiday selling season and a shift in sales from older hardware and software platform sales, which generate higher gross margins as platforms age, to current generation platform sales which have lower gross margins. Gross profit as a percentage of sales on the other product sales category increased from 33.8% in fiscal 2009 to 34.4% in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a shift in sales to higher margin accessories, increases in revenue associated with the Companys loyalty program and the increase in sales of digital online game cards, some of which are recorded on a commission basis at 100% margin. 38 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $65.5 million, or 4.0%, from $1,633.3 million in fiscal 2009 to $1,698.8 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of stores in operation and the related increases in store, distribution and corporate office operating expenses, as well as expenses incurred in our digital and loyalty initiatives in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.0% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses include $29.6 million and $37.8 million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and (losses) are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $2.5 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $3.8 million in fiscal 2009. Asset impairment and restructuring charges of $1.5 million and $1.8 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively, relate to impairment of assets at underperforming stores. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.1 million from $162.6 million in fiscal 2009 to $174.7 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to capital expenditures associated with the opening of 359 new stores during fiscal 2010 and investments in strategic initiatives and management information systems. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 due to continued investments in new stores, management information systems and other strategic initiatives. Interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances decreased from $2.2 million in fiscal 2009 to $1.8 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower invested cash balances and lower interest rates during fiscal 2010. Interest expense decreased from $45.4 million in fiscal 2009 to $37.0 million in fiscal 2010, primarily due to the retirement of $200.0 million of the Companys senior notes since January 30, 2010 and the retirement of $100.0 million of the Companys senior notes during fiscal 2009. Debt extinguishment expense of $6.0 million and $5.3 million was recognized in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively, as a result of the premiums paid related to debt retirement and the recognition of deferred financing fees and unamortized original issue discount. Income tax expense increased by $1.8 million, from $212.8 million in fiscal 2009 to $214.6 million in fiscal 2010. The Companys effective tax rate decreased from 36.2% in fiscal 2009 to 34.5% in fiscal 2010 due primarily to the variability in the accounting for the Companys uncertain tax positions. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. The factors described above led to an increase in operating earnings of $25.6 million, or 4.0%, from $637.0 million in fiscal 2009 to $662.6 million in fiscal 2010 and an increase in consolidated net income of $31.1 million, or 8.3%, from $375.7 million in fiscal 2009 to $406.8 million in fiscal 2010. The $1.2 million and $1.6 million net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively, represents the portion of the minority interest stockholders net loss of the Companys non wholly owned subsidiaries included in the Companys consolidated net income. Segment Performance The Company operates its business in the following segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance, the way in which our sales and profits are derived and how we divide management responsibility. Our sales and profits are driven through our physical stores which are highly integrated with our e commerce, digital and mobile businesses. Due to this integration, our physical stores are the basis for our segment reporting. Each of the segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and used video game systems, software and accessories (which we refer to as video game products) and PC entertainment software and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, 39 Table of Contents with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments. Stores in all segments are similar in size at an average of approximately 1,400 square feet. As we have expanded our presence in international markets, the Company has increased its operations in foreign currencies, including the euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, and the Norwegian kroner.

As of January 28, 2012, the United States segment included 4,503 GameStop stores, compared to 4,536 stores on January 29, 2011. Sales for fiscal 2011 decreased 0.7% compared to fiscal 2010 and comparable store sales decreased 1.2%. Comparable store sales decreased primarily due to decreases in new video game hardware sales and other product sales offset partially by an increase in used video game product sales. Despite the sales decrease, gross margin dollars increased by $88.1 million when compared to fiscal 2010 due to the higher mix of used video game product sales and higher other product margin primarily related to our digital initiatives. Asset impairments and restructuring charges of $28.9 million were recognized in fiscal 2011 primarily related to asset impairments, severance and disposal costs associated with the exit of non core businesses. No asset impairments or restructuring charges were recognized in fiscal 2010. Segment operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased by $28.9 million, or 5.4%, compared to fiscal 2010, an amount equal to the asset impairments and restructuring charges recognized in fiscal 2011. Canada Segment results for Canada include retail operations and an e commerce site in Canada. Sales in the Canadian segment in the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012 decreased 0.8% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011. The decrease in sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales at existing stores partially offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010, which had the effect of increasing sales by $11.8 million. Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates, sales in the Canadian segment decreased 3.1%. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily due to weak consumer traffic and a slow down in hardware unit sell through and lower price points when compared to fiscal 2010. As of January 28, 2012, the Canadian segment had 346 stores compared to 345 stores as of January 29, 2011. Segment operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $10.2 million to $12.4 million compared to $22.6 million for fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating income when compared to the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in sales at existing stores. The unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $0.3 million when compared to fiscal 2010. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail operations and e commerce sites in Australia and New Zealand. As of January 28, 2012, the Australian segment included 411 stores, compared to 405 stores as of January 29, 2011. Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012 increased 7.0% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010, which had the effect of increasing sales by $54.5 million. 41 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates, sales in the Australian segment decreased 2.7%. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the decrease in sales at existing stores offset by the additional sales at the 15 stores opened since January 30, 2011. The decrease in sales at existing stores when compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in comparable new video game hardware sales as the current generation of hardware platforms continues to age. Segment operating income in fiscal 2011 decreased by $5.6 million to $35.4 million when compared to $41.0 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating earnings for fiscal 2011 was due to the decrease in sales at existing stores and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation. This decrease in operating earnings was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates which had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $1.7 million when compared to fiscal 2010. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 13 European countries and e commerce operations in six countries. As of January 28, 2012, the European segment operated 1,423 stores, compared to 1,384 stores as of January 29, 2011. For the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012, European sales increased 5.0% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011. This increase in sales was primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2011, which had the effect of increasing sales by $73.8 million when compared to fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates, sales in the European segment increased 0.7%. The increase in sales was primarily due to additional sales in the 89 new stores opened since January 30, 2011, partially offset by a decrease in sales at existing stores. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily driven by weak consumer traffic due to the continued macroeconomic uncertainty and a decrease in comparable new video game hardware sales as the current generation of hardware platforms continues to age. The segment operating income in Europe for fiscal 2011 decreased by $48.0 million to $20.2 million compared to $68.2 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease in the operating income was primarily due to the impact of asset impairments and restructuring charges of $50.4 million, consisting primarily of the impairment of the Micromania trade name in the amount of $37.8 million. The remaining amount of $12.6 million consists of property and equipment impairments, other asset impairments, termination benefits, and facility closure and other costs. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 United States Segment results for the United States include retail operations in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam, the electronic commerce Web site www.gamestop.com, Game Informer magazine and www.kongregate.com, an online video gaming site. As of January 29, 2011, the United States segment included 4,536 GameStop stores, compared to 4,429 stores on January 30, 2010. Sales for fiscal 2010 increased 6.5% compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales at existing stores and the additional sales at the 434 stores opened since January 31, 2009, including the 227 stores opened in fiscal 2010. Sales at existing stores increased primarily due to strong sales of new release video game software and PC entertainment software and increased market share, partially offset by a slow down in hardware unit sales. Segment operating income for fiscal 2010 increased by 8.6% compared to fiscal 2009, driven by the increase in sales and related margin discussed above. Canada Segment results for Canada include retail operations and an e commerce site in Canada. Sales in the Canadian segment in the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011 increased 2.2% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009, which had the effect of increasing sales by $38.8 million. 42 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates, sales in the Canadian segment decreased 5.7%. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the decrease in sales at existing stores, offset by the additional sales at the 26 stores opened since January 31, 2009. As of January 29, 2011, the Canadian segment had 345 stores compared to 337 stores as of January 30, 2010. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily due to weak consumer traffic and a slow down in hardware unit sell through and lower price points when compared to fiscal 2009. Segment operating income for fiscal 2010 decreased $12.4 million to $22.6 million compared to $35.0 million for fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating income when compared to the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in sales at existing stores and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates which had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $1.6 million when compared to fiscal 2009. Australia Segment results for Australia include retail operations and e commerce sites in Australia and New Zealand. As of January 29, 2011, the Australian segment included 405 stores, compared to 388 stores as of January 30, 2010. Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011 increased 6.6% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009, which had the effect of increasing sales by $63.8 million. Excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates, sales in the Australian segment decreased 5.4%. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the decrease in sales at existing stores offset by the additional sales at the 59 stores opened since January 31, 2009. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily due to weak consumer traffic and a slow down in hardware unit sell through and lower price points when compared to fiscal 2009. Segment operating income in fiscal 2010 decreased by $5.0 million to $41.0 million when compared to $46.0 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating earnings for fiscal 2010 was due to the decrease in sales at existing stores and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the increase in the number of stores in operation. Selling, general and administrative expenses will rise as a percentage of sales during periods of store count growth due to the fixed nature of many store expenses compared to the immature sales at new stores. This decrease in operating earnings was offset by the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates which had the effect of increasing operating earnings by $3.8 million when compared to fiscal 2009. Europe Segment results for Europe include retail operations in 13 European countries and e commerce operations in five countries. As of January 29, 2011, the European segment operated 1,384 stores, compared to 1,296 stores as of January 30, 2010. For the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011, European sales decreased 3.2% compared to the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2010. This decrease in sales was due to the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal 2010, which had the effect of decreasing sales by $106.4 million when compared to fiscal 2009, and a decrease in sales at existing stores. The decrease in sales was partially offset by additional sales at the 228 new stores opened since January 31, 2009. The decrease in sales at existing stores was primarily driven by weak consumer traffic due to the continued macroeconomic weakness and lower hardware sales as a result of a slow down in hardware unit sell through and lower price points when compared to fiscal 2009. The segment operating income in Europe for fiscal 2010 increased by $1.0 million to $68.2 million compared to $67.2 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in the operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, driven by an increase in used product sales, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in exchange rates, which had the effect of decreasing operating earnings by $6.5 million when compared to fiscal 2009. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows During fiscal 2011, cash provided by operations was $624.7 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $591.2 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in cash provided by operations of $33.5 million from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital purposes of $49.6 million, primarily driven by lower inventory purchases in fiscal 2011 and the related effects on payments of accounts payable. The lower inventory purchases were due to lower hardware sales in fiscal 2011, and inventory management initiatives. Inventory turnover was relatively consistent from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. Also contributing to the change in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the increase in accrued liabilities, including customer liabilities, primarily related to the growth of the Companys PowerUp Rewards program. During fiscal 2010, cash provided by operations was $591.2 million, compared to cash provided by operations of $644.2 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease in cash provided by operations of $53.0 million from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cash used for inventory, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the decrease in other long term liabilities, as well as the changes in the adjustment related to the excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock based awards, which decreased cash provided by operations by $18.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash provided by consolidated net income, including the non cash adjustments to earnings. The increase in net inventory was primarily due to higher purchases during fiscal 2010, particularly during the holiday season primarily related to hardware units which were at lower in stock positions at the end of fiscal 2009. Cash used in investing activities was $201.6 million in fiscal 2011, $240.1 million in fiscal 2010 and $187.2 million in fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2011, the Company used $165.1 million for capital expenditures primarily to invest in information systems, distribution center capacity and e commerce, digital and loyalty program initiatives and to open 285 stores in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, during fiscal 2011, the Company used $30.1 million for acquisitions in support of the Companys digital initiatives. During fiscal 2010, the Company used $197.6 million for capital expenditures primarily to open 359 stores and to invest in information systems and $38.1 million for acquisitions in support of the Companys digital initiatives. During fiscal 2009, the Company used $163.8 million for capital expenditures primarily to open 388 new stores and to invest in information systems. In addition, the Company used $8.4 million on acquisitions. Cash used in financing activities was $492.6 million in fiscal 2011. Cash used in financing activities was $555.6 million and $154.4 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 were primarily for the repurchase of $262.1 million of treasury shares and $250.0 million in principal of the Companys senior notes. The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2010 were primarily for the repurchase of $381.2 million of treasury shares and $200.0 million in principal of the Companys senior notes. The cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2009 were primarily for the repurchase of $100.0 million in principal of the Companys senior notes and the repurchase of $58.4 million of treasury shares. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was also impacted by cash provided by the issuance of shares associated with stock option exercises of $18.1 million, $10.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Sources of Liquidity We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various growth initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value, and consist primarily of time deposits with highly rated commercial banks and money market investment funds holding direct U.S. Treasury obligations. 44 Table of Contents On January 4, 2011, the Company entered into a $400 million credit agreement (the Revolver), which amended and restated, in its entirety, the Companys prior credit agreement entered into in October 2005 (the Credit Agreement). The Revolver provides for a five year, $400 million asset based facility, including a $50 million letter of credit sublimit, secured by substantially all of the Companys and its domestic subsidiaries assets. The Company has the ability to increase the facility, which matures in January 2016, by $150 million under certain circumstances. The extension of the Revolver to January 2016 reduces our exposure to potential tightening in the credit markets. The availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows the Company to borrow up to 90% of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus 90% of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. The Companys ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options and repurchase shares is generally permitted, except under certain circumstances, including if Revolver excess availability is less than 20%, or is projected to be within 12 months after such payment. In addition, if Revolver usage is projected to be equal to or greater than 25% of the borrowing base during the prospective 12 month period, the Company is subject to meeting a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1:1.0 prior to making such payments. In the event that excess availability under the Revolver is at any time less than the greater of (1) $40.0 million or (2) 12.5% of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.1:1.0. The Revolver places certain restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, loans, guarantees, acquisitions and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Absent consent from its lenders, the Company may not incur more than $750 million of additional unsecured indebtedness to be limited to $250 million in general unsecured obligations and $500 million in unsecured obligations to finance acquisitions valued at $500 million or more. The per annum interest rate under the Revolver is variable and is calculated by applying a margin (1) for prime rate loans of 1.25% to 1.50% above the highest of (a) the prime rate of the administrative agent, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (c) the London Interbank Offered (LIBO) rate for a 30 day interest period as determined on such day plus 1.00%, and (2) for LIBO rate loans of 2.25% to 2.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Companys average daily excess availability under the facility. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on facility usage, for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of January 28, 2012, the applicable margin was 1.25% for prime rate loans and 2.25% for LIBO rate loans, while the required commitment fee was 0.50% for the unused portion of the Revolver. The Revolver provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by the Company or the borrowers proving to be false in any material respect, certain bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting the Company or its subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and mergers or the liquidation of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries. During fiscal 2011, the Company borrowed and repaid $35.0 million under the Revolver. During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, the Company borrowed and repaid $120.0 million and $115.0 million, respectively, under the prior Credit Agreement. As of January 28, 2012, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding totaled $8.8 million. In September 2007, the Companys Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary $20.0 million Uncommitted Line of Credit (the Line of Credit) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit will be made available to the Companys foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of January 28, 2012, there were no cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled $5.0 million. 45 Table of Contents In September 2005, the Company, along with GameStop, Inc. as co issuer (together with the Company, the Issuers), completed the offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2011 (the Senior Floating Rate Notes) and $650 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes and, together with the Senior Floating Rate Notes, the Notes). The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated September 28, 2005 (the Indenture), by and among the Issuers, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee. In November 2006, Wilmington Trust Company was appointed as the new trustee for the Notes (the Trustee). The Senior Notes bore interest at 8.0% per annum, were to mature on October 1, 2012 and were priced at 98.688%, resulting in a discount at the time of issue of $8.5 million. The discount was amortized using the effective interest method. The Issuers paid interest on the Senior Notes semi annually, in arrears, every April 1 and October 1, to holders of record on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, and at maturity. As of January 28, 2012, the Senior Notes have been fully redeemed. As of January 29, 2011, the only long term debt outstanding was the Senior Notes. Uses of Capital Our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened 285 stores in fiscal 2011. We expect to open approximately 150 stores in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are projected to be approximately $140 million, to be used primarily to fund continued digital initiatives, new store openings, store remodels and invest in distribution and information systems in support of operations. Between May 2006 and December 2011, the Company repurchased and redeemed the $300 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes and the $650 million of Senior Notes under previously announced buybacks authorized by the Companys Board of Directors. The repurchased Notes were delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. The associated loss on the retirement of debt was $1.0 million for the 52 week period ended January 28, 2012, which consisted of the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. The associated loss on the retirement of debt was $6.0 million and $5.3 million for the 52 week periods ended January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, which consisted of the premium paid to retire the Notes and the write off of the deferred financing fees and the original issue discount on the Notes. The changes in the carrying amount of the Senior Notes for the Company for the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2012 were as follows (in millions): Balance at January 30, 2010 $ 447.3 Repurchased and redeemed Senior Notes, net (198.3 ) Balance at January 29, 2011 $ 249.0 Redeemed Senior Notes, net (249.0 ) Balance at January 28, 2012 $ 0.0 We used cash to expand the Company through acquisitions. During fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, the Company used $30.1 million, $38.1 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for acquisitions which were primarily for the Companys overall digital growth strategy. In January 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $300 million share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock. For fiscal 2009, the number of shares repurchased was 6.1 million for an average price per share of $20.12. Of these shares, $64.6 million of treasury share purchases were settled at the beginning of fiscal 2010. In September 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an additional $300 million share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock. 46 Table of Contents For fiscal 2010, the number of shares repurchased was 17.1 million for an average price per share of $19.84. Of these shares, $22.0 million of treasury share purchases were settled at the beginning of fiscal 2011. In February 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a $500 million repurchase fund to be used for share repurchases of its common stock and or to retire the Companys Senior Notes. This plan replaced the September 2010 $300 million stock repurchase plan which had $138.4 million remaining. In November 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to use $500 million to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock and or retire the Companys Senior Notes, replacing the remaining $180.1 million authorization. For fiscal 2011, the number of shares repurchased was 11.2 million for an average price per share of $21.38. As of March 22, 2012, the Company has purchased an additional 3.3 million shares for an average price per share of $22.97. On March 20, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to use $500 million to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock, replacing the remaining $253.4 million of the November 2011 authorization. On February 8, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to its stockholders of $0.15 per Class A common share. The first quarterly cash dividend was paid on March 12, 2012 to all stockholders of record as of February 21, 2012. Future dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors of the Company. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under the Revolver will be sufficient to fund our operations, digital initiatives, store expansion and remodeling activities and corporate capital expenditure programs for at least the next 12 months. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of January 28, 2012: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years (In millions) Operating Leases $ 1,124.8 $ 344.0 $ 421.5 $ 189.2 $ 170.1 Purchase Obligations(1) 690.9 690.9 Total $ 1,815.7 $ 1,034.9 $ 421.5 $ 189.2 $ 170.1 (1) Purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders for merchandise from vendors. These purchase orders are generally cancelable until shipment of the products. In addition to minimum rentals, the operating leases generally require the Company to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs and may provide for percentage rentals. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores. Leases with step rent provisions, escalation clauses or other lease concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term, including renewal options for those leases in which it is reasonably assured that the Company will exercise the renewal option. The Company does not have leases with capital improvement funding. The Company has entered into employment agreements with Daniel A. DeMatteo, Executive Chairman; R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman International; J. Paul Raines, Chief Executive Officer; Tony D. Bartel, President; and Robert A. Lloyd, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The term of the employment agreement with Mr. DeMatteo commenced on April 11, 2005, when he was Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and was renewed in April 2010 with an expiration date of March 3, 2013. The term of the employment agreement with Mr. Fontaine commenced on April 11, 2005, when he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and was renewed in April 2010 with an expiration date of March 3, 2013. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Raines commenced on September 7, 2008 and was amended on June 2, 2010 47 Table of Contents with an expiration date of June 2, 2013. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Bartel commenced on October 24, 2008 and was amended on June 2, 2010 with an expiration date of June 2, 2013. The term of the employment agreement for Mr. Lloyd commenced on June 2, 2010 and continues for a period of three years thereafter. Each of the employment agreements was amended on February 9, 2011 to eliminate the right of each executive to terminate his employment agreement as a result of a change in control of the Company. The amendments also eliminated the automatic renewal provision of each agreement, except for Mr. Fontaine, whose agreement does not contain an automatic renewal provision. The minimum annual salaries during the term of employment under the amended and restated employment agreements for Messrs. Fontaine, Raines, Bartel and Lloyd shall be no less than $600,000, $1,000,000, $750,000 and $500,000, respectively. The Board of Directors of the Company has set the annual salaries of Messrs. DeMatteo, Raines, Bartel and Lloyd for fiscal 2012 at $900,000, $1,030,000, $806,000 and $600,000, respectively. The employment agreement for Mr. Fontaine stipulates that his annual salary for the period between March 27, 2011 and March 3, 2013 will be $600,000. As of January 28, 2012, we had standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $8.8 million and had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of $18.2 million, $12.6 million of which are cash collateralized. As of January 28, 2012, the Company had $25.4 million of income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other long term liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet. At the time of this filing, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. In 2003, the Company purchased a 51% controlling interest in GameStop Group Limited, which operates stores in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the minority interest owners have the ability to require the Company to purchase their remaining shares in incremental percentages at a price to be determined based partially on the Companys price to earnings ratio and GameStop Group Limiteds earnings. Shares representing 16%, 16% and 7% were purchased in June 2008, July 2009 and July 2011, respectively, bringing the Companys total interest in GameStop Group Limited to approximately 91%. The Company already consolidates the results of GameStop Group Limited; therefore, any additional amounts acquired will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 28, 2012, the Company had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S K. Impact of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which revises the current practice of including other comprehensive income within the equity section of the statement of financial position and requires disclosure of other comprehensive income either 48 Table of Contents in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in a separate statement. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011 05 is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position, but the adoption will change the current presentation of other comprehensive income in the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011 08 modifies step one of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and offers guidance on when to perform step two of the testing. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based upon factors such as unanticipated competition, the loss of key personnel and adverse regulatory changes. ASU 2011 08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011 08 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Seasonality Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other factors, the timing of new product introductions and new store openings, sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Exposure Our Revolvers per annum interest rate is variable and is based on one of (i) the U.S. prime rate, (ii) the LIBO rate or (iii) the U.S. federal funds rate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. We limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term, highly liquid instruments with a maturity of one year or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances, and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest. Foreign Currency Risk The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross currency swaps (together, the Foreign Currency Contracts) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Foreign Currency Contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, the Company recognized a $13.5 million gain in selling, general and administrative expenses related to the trading of derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of the Foreign Currency Contracts as of January 28, 2012 was a net asset of $14.5 million as measured by observable inputs obtained from market news reporting services, such as Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, and industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. A hypothetical strengthening or weakening of 10% in the foreign exchange rates underlying the Foreign Currency Contracts from the market rate as of January 28, 2012 would result in a (loss) or gain in value of the forwards, options and swaps of ($21.3) million or $21.3 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. The Company manages counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under comprehensive 49 Table of Contents risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements.
