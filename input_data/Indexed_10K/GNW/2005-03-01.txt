Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our financial statements, the related notes and the accompanying independent registered public accounting firms report (which refers to a change in accounting for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts in 2004, variable interest entities in 2003 and goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002), which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In connection with the IPO, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GEFAHI. We also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the Genworth management team. These businesses include international mortgage insurance, payment protection insurance based in Europe, a Bermuda reinsurer and mortgage contract underwriting. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion note and the $550 million Contingent Note. Shortly after the completion of the IPO, we refinanced the $2.4 billion note with $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. We have prepared our financial statements as if Genworth had been in existence throughout all relevant periods. Our historical financial information and statements include all businesses that were owned by GEFAHI, including those that were not transferred to us, as well as the other insurance businesses that we acquired from other GE subsidiaries, each in connection with our corporate reorganization. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of GE. As part of these transactions, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under our structured settlement contracts, which had reserves of $12.0 billion, and our variable annuity contracts, which had general account reserves of $2.8 billion and separate account reserves of $7.9 billion, each as of December 31, 2003. These contracts represent substantially all of our contracts that were in force as of December 31, 2003 for these products. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under a block of long term care insurance policies that we reinsured from Travelers, which had reserves of $1.5 billion, as of December 31, 2003. In the aggregate, these blocks of business did not meet our target return thresholds, and although we remain liable under these contracts and policies as the ceding insurer, the reinsurance transactions have the effect of transferring the financial results of the reinsured blocks to UFLIC. In addition, as part of the reinsurance transactions, UFLIC ceded to us substantially all of its in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance. As of December 31, 2003, these blocks of business had aggregate reserves of $19 million. The unaudited pro forma financial information set forth below reflects our historical financial information, as adjusted to give effect to the transactions described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma 86 Table of Contents Financial Information, as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2004. The following transactions are reflected in the pro forma financial information: the removal of certain businesses of GEFAHI that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization; the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, including a capital contribution of $1.836 billion to UFLIC; the issuance of equity and debt securities to GEFAHI in exchange for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization; the issuance and sale of $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper; and the other adjustments described below in the notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma financial information below is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what our results of operations would have been had the transactions described above occurred on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma financial information also should not be considered representative of our future results of operations. In addition to the pro forma adjustments to our historical statement of earnings, various other factors will have an effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including those discussed under Item 7.

See note 5 to our financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. (2) During 2000, we consummated three significant business combinations: In July 2000, we reinsured 90% of Travelers long term care insurance portfolio and acquired certain related assets for $411 million; In April 2000, we acquired Phoenix American Life Insurance Company for $284 million; and Effective March 2000, we acquired the insurance policies and related assets of Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company. Our Japanese life insurance business assumed $21.6 billion of policyholder liabilities and $0.3 billion of accounts payable and accrued expenses and acquired $20.3 billion in cash, investments and other tangible assets through this transaction. We sold this business on August 29, 2003, and its results have been presented as discontinued operations. (3) As of January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and, in accordance with its provisions, discontinued amortization of goodwill. Goodwill amortization was $84 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, excluding goodwill amortization included in discontinued operations. (4) Net operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1,044 million. We define net operating earnings as pro forma net earnings from continuing operations, excluding pro forma after tax net realized investment gains and 88 Table of Contents losses (which can fluctuate significantly from period to period), changes in accounting principles and non recurring, infrequent or unusual items. There were no non recurring, infrequent or unusual items excluded from pro forma net operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004, other than an IPO related net tax benefit and a gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global business processing operation, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004. We believe that analysis of net operating earnings enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. However, net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. In addition, our definition of net operating earnings may differ from the definitions used by other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of pro forma net operating earnings (as defined above) to pro forma net earnings from continuing operations: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, 2004 Pro forma net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,130 Pro forma net realized (gains) on investments, net of taxes (15 ) Net tax benefit related to initial public offering (46 ) Gain on outsourcing services agreement, net of taxes (25 ) Net operating earnings $ 1,044 (5) Basic and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 are calculated by dividing the net earnings from continuing operations by 489.5 million weighted average basic shares outstanding and by 490.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Basic and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002 were calculated by dividing net earnings from continuing operations by 489.5 million pro forma shares outstanding. The number of shares used in our calculation of diluted earnings per share increased in 2004 due to additional shares of Class A Common Stock issuable under stock options and restricted stock units and is calculated using the treasury method. (6) Reflects the results of businesses that were owned by GEFAHI but were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization, including (a) the Partnership Marketing Group business, (b) an institutional asset management business, and (c) several other small businesses that were not part of our core ongoing business. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our historical and pro forma financial information. (7) For a description of the non recourse funding obligations, see note 14 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. (8) Includes statutory capital and surplus and statutorily required contingency reserves held by our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In December 2004, our U.S. mortgage insurance business released $700 million of statutory contingency reserves and paid that amount as a dividend to the holding company of that business. 89 Table of Contents Pro Forma Financial Information Year ended December 31, 2004 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Historical Pro forma adjustments excluded assets and liabilities  Pro forma adjustments reinsurance transactions Pro forma adjustments capital structure Pro forma Revenues: Premiums $ 6,559 $ (80 )(a) $ (91 )(d) $ $ 6,388 Net investment income 3,648 (27 )(a) (431 )(d) 3,160 (1 )(b) (29 )(e) Net realized investment gains 26 (3 )(c) 23 Policy fees and other income 824 (103 )(a) (57 )(d) 664 Total revenues 11,057 (214 ) (608 ) 10,235 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 4,804 (71 )(a) (393 )(d) 4,340 Interest credited 1,432 (113 )(d) 1,319 Underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,812 (117 )(a) (38 )(d) 1,657 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 1,154 (46 )(a) (56 )(d) 1,052 Interest expense 217 (40 )(f) 243 12 (g) 9 (h) 45 (i) Total benefits and expenses 9,419 (234 ) (600 ) 26 8,611 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 1,638 20 (8 ) (26 ) 1,624 Provision for income taxes 493 14 (a) (4 )(d) (8 )(j) 494 (1 )(c) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,145 $ 7 $ (4 ) $ (18 ) $ 1,130 Net earnings from continuing operations per share: Basic $ 2.34 $ 2.31 Diluted $ 2.33 $ 2.30 Number of shares outstanding: Basic 489.5 489.5 Diluted 490.5 490.5 90 Table of Contents Notes to unaudited pro forma financial information (a) Reflects adjustments to exclude amounts included in our historical earnings relating to results of operations of businesses (formerly reported in our Affinity segment) that were not transferred to us. The exclusion of these businesses from our historical financial statements was accounted for as a pre IPO dividend to GEFAHI in 2004. (b) Reflects adjustments to exclude amounts included in our historical earnings relating to results of operations of certain investment partnerships that were not transferred to us. The exclusion of these partnerships from our historical financial statements was accounted for as a pre IPO dividend to GEFAHI in 2004. (c) Reflects adjustments to exclude amounts included in our historical earnings relating to net realized investment (gains) losses and related income tax benefits, attributable to sales of Affinity segment assets. In our historical financial statements, net realized (gains) losses are reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. (d) Reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions we entered into with, and the related contribution we made to, UFLIC, an indirect subsidiary of GE. As part of these transactions, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under our structured settlement contracts and our variable annuity contracts. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under a block of long term care insurance policies. As part of the reinsurance transactions, UFLIC ceded to us substantially all of its in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance. Prior to the completion of our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, the results of operation of UFLIC were included in our historical results. The unaudited pro forma earnings information gives effect to the reinsurance transactions as if each occurred as of January 1, 2004 and excludes the effects of all ceded reinsured contracts that were issued before January 1, 2004. We have continued to sell variable annuities and structured settlements after completion of the reinsurance transactions and we are retaining that business for our own account, subject to third party reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Under the reinsurance transactions, we receive an expense allowance to reimburse us for costs we incur to service the reinsured blocks. Actual costs and expense allowance amounts will be determined by expense studies to be conducted periodically. The pro forma adjustments have been prepared assuming that actual costs incurred during the pro forma periods, as determined under our historical cost structure and allocation methods, were reimbursed by an expense allowance. (e) Concurrently with the reinsurance transactions described in note (d), we contributed $1.836 billion of capital to UFLIC, which primarily represented the excess statutory capital in our insurance subsidiaries, after giving effect to the reinsurance transactions. Because a significant portion of the assets contributed to UFLIC were not owned for the entire period from January 1, 2004 until the date of the capital contribution, the pro forma adjustments to reduce net investment income and net realized investment gains related to the transferred assets were based upon a proportional allocation of investment income from the investment assets historically identified as (1) supporting the blocks of business reinsured in the reinsurance transactions, and (2) representing surplus of the subsidiaries providing assets that were contributed to UFLIC. (f) Reflects adjustments to exclude the interest expense included in our historical earnings, adjusted for qualified hedge effects, on commercial paper issued by GEFAHI of $1,696 million and short term borrowings from GE Capital of $800 million. The commercial paper, short term borrowings and related derivative contracts liabilities were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. (g) Reflects adjustments to record (1) interest expense and contract adjustment payments on $600 million of our Equity Units and (2) dividends payable on $100 million of our mandatorily redeemable Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock. The senior notes forming part of the Equity Units accrue interest at the rate of 3.84% per year, and the purchase contracts forming part of the Equity Units accrue contract adjustment payments at the rate of 2.16% per year. The Series A Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 5.25% per year, which is recorded as interest expense. Both the Equity Units and the Series A Preferred Stock were issued to 91 Table of Contents GEFAHI on May 24, 2004 in connection with our corporate reorganization, and the interest expense and contract adjustment payments on these securities are included in our historical financial results from that date. GEFAHI sold all the Equity Units and Series A Preferred Stock in public offerings concurrent with our IPO. (h) Reflects adjustments to record interest expense on our obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement with GE. Interest accretion on the Tax Matters Agreement is reflected in our historical financial results from May 24, 2004, the date of our corporate reorganization, at the rate of 5.72% per year. (i) Reflects adjustments to record interest expense, net of the impact of hedging arrangements, on long term borrowings pursuant to $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. The effective interest rates for the senior notes (giving effect to hedging arrangements) are as follows: 3.53% per year for the $500 million of 2007 notes, 4.48% per year for the $500 million of 2009 notes, 5.51% per year for the $600 million of 2014 notes, and 6.35% per year for the $300 million of 2034 notes. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2004 was 2.38%; the pro forma adjustments have been prepared using the rate assumed at the time of our corporate reorganization, which was 1.07%. Interest expense on these borrowings is included in our historical financial results from the issuance of the senior notes on June 15, 2004 and the commercial paper on June 9, 2004. (j) Reflects an adjustment to record the tax impact on other pro forma earnings adjustments at a rate of 35%. 92 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes as well as the pro forma financial information and related notes included herein.

Overview Our business We are a leading insurance company in the U.S., with an expanding international presence. We have three operating segments: Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, and Mortgage Insurance. Protection. We offer U.S. customers life insurance, long term care insurance and, primarily for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, group life and health insurance. In Europe, we offer payment protection insurance, which helps consumers meet their payment obligations in the event of illness, involuntary unemployment, disability or death. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Protection segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $527 million. Retirement Income and Investments. We offer U.S. customers fixed and variable deferred annuities, income annuities, variable life insurance, asset management and specialized products, including guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and structured settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Retirement Income and Investments segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $148 million. Mortgage Insurance. In the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, we offer mortgage insurance products that facilitate homeownership by enabling borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Mortgage Insurance segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $426 million. We also have a Corporate and Other segment, which consists primarily of unallocated corporate income and expenses (including amounts accrued in settlement of class action lawsuits), the results of small, non core businesses that are managed outside our operating segments, most of our interest and other financing expenses and net realized investment gains (losses). For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Corporate and Other segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $29 million. Our corporate reorganization We were incorporated in Delaware on October 23, 2003 in preparation for our corporate reorganization and the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GEFAHI. GEFAHI is an indirect subsidiary of GE and prior to the completion of the IPO, was a holding company for a group of companies that provide life insurance, long term care insurance, group life and health insurance, annuities and other investment products and U.S. mortgage insurance. We also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the Genworth management team. These businesses include international mortgage insurance, payment protection insurance based in Europe, a Bermuda reinsurer and mortgage contract underwriting. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion short term note and a $550 million contingent non interest bearing note. We refinanced the $2.4 billion note with $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper shortly after the IPO, and we repaid the contingent note in December 2004. 94 Table of Contents Our historical and pro forma financial information The historical financial information has been derived from our financial statements, which have been prepared as if Genworth had been in existence throughout all relevant periods. Our historical financial information and statements include all businesses that were owned by GEFAHI, including those that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization, as well as the other insurance businesses that we acquired from other GE subsidiaries in connection with our corporate reorganization. In addition to our three operating segments and our Corporate and Other segment, our historical financial statements also include the results of (1) the Partnership Marketing Group business, which offers life and health insurance, auto club memberships and other financial products and services directly to consumers through affinity marketing arrangements with a variety of organizations, (2) an institutional asset management business owned by GEFAHI, and (3) several other small businesses owned by GEFAHI that are not part of our core ongoing business. The Partnership Marketing Group historically included UFLIC, a subsidiary that offered life and health insurance products through affinity marketing arrangements. In connection with the IPO, GEFAHI transferred UFLIC to General Electric Capital Services, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of GE. We did not acquire the Partnership Marketing Group business, the institutional asset management business or these other small businesses from GEFAHI, and their results are presented as a separate operating segment under the caption Affinity. Our historical financial statements also include our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which we sold on August 29, 2003, and which are presented in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations. The unaudited pro forma information presented herein reflects our historical financial information, as adjusted to give effect to the transactions described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2004. Revenues and expenses Our revenues consist primarily of the following: Protection. The revenues in our Protection segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on individual life, individual long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies; net investment income on the separate investment portfolio held by our payment protection insurance business or allocated to this segments other lines of business; and policy fees and other income, including fees for mortality and surrender charges primarily from universal life insurance policies, and other administrative charges. Retirement Income and Investments. The revenues in our Retirement Income and Investments segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies; net investment income allocated to this segment; and policy fees and other income, including surrender charges, mortality and expense charges, investment management fees and commissions. Mortgage Insurance. The revenues in our Mortgage Insurance segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on mortgage insurance policies; net investment income on the segments separate investment portfolio; and policy fees and other income, including fees from contract underwriting services. 95 Table of Contents Corporate and Other. The revenues in our Corporate and Other segment consist primarily of: net premiums, policy fees and other income from the insurance businesses in this segment; unallocated net investment income; and net realized investment gains (losses). We allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Protection (except payment protection insurance) and Retirement Income and Investments segments using an approach based principally upon the investment portfolio established to support each of those segments products and targeted capital levels. We do not allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Mortgage Insurance segment or to our payment protection insurance product within the Protection segment, because they have their own separate investment portfolios, and the net investment income from those portfolios is reflected in the Mortgage Insurance and Protection segment results. In our historical financial statements, we allocated net investment income to our Affinity segment in the same manner that we allocated these items to our Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments. All net realized investment gains (losses) are reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and are not reflected in the results of any of our other segments. Our expenses consist primarily of the following: benefits provided to policyholders and contractholders and changes in reserves; interest credited on general account balances; underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, including commissions, marketing expenses, policy and contract servicing costs, overhead and other general expenses that are not capitalized (shown net of deferrals); amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other intangible assets; interest and other financing expenses; and income taxes. We allocate corporate expenses to each of our operating segments based on the amount of capital allocated to that segment. Business trends and conditions In recent years, our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry wide and product specific trends and conditions. Market and economic environment Aging U.S. population with growing retirement income needs. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, from 1945 to 2003, U.S. life expectancy at birth increased from 62.9 years to 74.4 years for men and from 68.4 years to 79.5 years for women, respectively, and life expectancy is expected to increase further. In addition, increasing numbers of baby boomers are approaching retirement age. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the percentage of the U.S. population aged 55 or older will increase from approximately 22% (65 million) in 2004 to more than 29% (97 million) in 2020. These increases in life expectancy and the average age of the U.S. population heighten the risk that individuals will outlive their retirement savings. In addition, approximately $4.4 trillion of invested financial assets (25% of all U.S. invested financial assets) are held by people within 10 years of retirement and will be available to be converted to income as those people retire, and approximately $3.3 trillion of invested financial assets are held by individuals who are under age 70 and consider themselves retired, in each case according to a survey conducted by SRI Consulting Business Intelligence in 2002. We believe these trends will lead to growing demand for retirement income and investment products, such as our annuities and other investment products, that help consumers accumulate assets and provide reliable retirement income. 96 Table of Contents Growing lifestyle protection gap. The aging U.S. population and a number of other factors are creating a significant lifestyle protection gap for a growing number of individuals. This gap is the result of individuals not having sufficient resources, including insurance coverage, to ensure that their future assets and income will be adequate to support their desired future lifestyle. Other factors contributing to this gap include declining individual savings rates, rising healthcare and nursing care costs, and a shifting of the burden for funding protection needs from governments and employers to individuals. Recent reductions in employer paid benefits by many companies, coupled with uncertainty over the future of government benefit programs, underscore the potential for long term benefit reductions from these traditional sources and the potential need for individuals to identify alternative sources of these benefits. At the same time, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal savings rates decreased from 10.8% in 1984 to 1.0% in 2004. Consumers are exposed to the rising costs of healthcare and nursing care during their retirement years, and some experts believe that many consumers are underinsured with respect to their protection needs. We expect these trends to result in increased demand for our life, long term care and small group life and health insurance products. Increasing opportunities for mortgage insurance internationally and in the U.S. We believe a number of factors have contributed and will contribute to the growth of mortgage insurance in Canada, Australia and the U.S., where we have significant mortgage insurance operations. These factors include increasing homeownership levels (spurred in part by government housing policies that favor homeownership and demographic factors driving demand for housing); expansion of low down payment mortgage loan offerings; legislative and regulatory policies that provide capital incentives for lenders to transfer the risks of low down payment mortgages to mortgage insurers; and expansion of secondary mortgage markets that require credit enhancements, such as mortgage insurance. We believe a number of these factors also are becoming evident in some European, Latin American, and Asian markets, where lenders increasingly are using mortgage insurance to manage the risks of their loan portfolios and to expand low down payment lending. General conditions and trends affecting our businesses Interest rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a significant effect on our sales of insurance and investment products and our margins on these products. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. In our Retirement Income and Investments and Protection segments, low market interest rates may reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to policyholders and contractholders and the yield we earn on the investments that support these obligations. In response to the unusually low interest rates that have prevailed during the last several years, we have reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on newly issued fixed annuity contracts and have reduced crediting rates on in force contracts where permitted to do so. These actions have helped mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our spreads and profitability on these products. A gradual increase in interest rates generally would have a favorable effect on the profitability of these products. However, rapidly rising interest rates also could result in reduced persistency in our spread based retail products as contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. In our Protection segment, the pricing and expected future profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products are based in part on expected investment returns. Over time, term life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as we receive them. Low interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products. The impact of interest rate fluctuations on our universal life insurance products is similar to their impact on spread based products in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. In our Mortgage Insurance segment, increasing interest rates in 2004 have contributed to a decrease in new mortgage originations in the U.S. and a resulting decrease in new mortgage insurance written. Our U.S. new insurance written decreased by 58% from $67.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $28.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily because of increased interest rates. Higher interest rates in 2004 and 97 Table of Contents the significant refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 also resulted in reduced refinancing activity in 2004, which had a positive impact on U.S. flow persistency. U.S. flow persistency rates increased from 46% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 65% for the year ended December 31, 2004, excluding the effect of a periodic payoff reconciliation on one structured transaction involving single premium mortgage insurance that today would be classified as bulk insurance. We expect that continued interest rate increases will have a favorable impact on persistency and an adverse impact on new mortgage originations and new mortgage insurance written. Volatile equity markets. Equity market volatility may discourage purchases of separate account products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products. Equity market volatility also affects the value of the assets in our separate accounts, which, in turn, affects our earnings from fee based products. After several years of declines, equity markets increased in 2003 and 2004, and we expect that increases or relative stability in equity markets could have a favorable impact on our sales of variable products and our earnings from those products. The potential impact of volatile equity markets on our results has been significantly reduced as a result of our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC, pursuant to which we reinsured, effective as of January 1, 2004, substantially all of our in force blocks of variable annuities. We retain variable annuities sold after January 1, 2004 for our own account, subject to third party reinsurance transactions in the ordinary course of business, and therefore we bear the risk of any adverse impact of future equity market fluctuations on those annuities. In addition, fluctuations in the equity markets may affect revenues and returns from our private asset management products and services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management. Credit default risk. As a result of the economic downturn in 2000 through 2002 and some high profile corporate bankruptcies and scandals, the number of companies defaulting on their debt obligations increased dramatically in 2001 and 2002. These defaults and other declines in the value of some of our investments resulted in impairment charges. Credit defaults have decreased in recent years as the economy has improved. Charges associated with impairments of investments were $26 million, $224 million, and $343 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A weakening in the economic recovery could lead to increased credit defaults. Investment portfolio. The yield on our investment portfolio is affected by the practice, prior to our separation from GE, of realizing investment gains through the sale of appreciated securities and other assets during a period of historically low interest rates. This strategy had been pursued to offset impairments and losses in our investment portfolio, fund consolidations and restructurings in our business and provide current income. Our gross realized gains were $473 million and $790 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This strategy has had an adverse impact on the yield on our investment portfolio and our net investment income as we typically sold higher yielding securities and reinvested the proceeds in lower yielding securities during periods of declining or low interest rates. The impact is most significant in the Retirement Income and Investments segment, which has a higher percentage of our fixed maturities allocated to it than to our other segments. Since our separation from GE, our investment strategy has been to optimize investment income without relying on realized investment gains. As a result, our gross realized gains decreased to $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We also are currently experiencing a challenging interest rate environment in which the yields that we can achieve on new investments are lower than the aggregate yield on our existing portfolio. This environment has resulted in a decline in our overall investment yield, from 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 5.8% and 5.5% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We seek to mitigate this decline in investment yields by continuously evaluating our asset class mix, pursuing additional investment classes and accepting additional credit risk when we believe that it is prudent to do so. A continued increase in prevailing interest rates also will mitigate this decline, whereas a decrease in interest rates could lead to further declines. Globalization. Historically, we have derived a majority of our revenues and profits from our operations in the U.S. However, in recent years, our international business has grown and has had an increasing impact on our 98 Table of Contents financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 19%, 18% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and 29%, 26% and 12% of our net earnings from continuing operations, respectively, were generated by our international operations. These increases were largely due to growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Our payment protection insurance business also derives revenues in the countries where it offers its products. We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our financial statements. As a result, period to period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $31 million and $25 million, respectively, due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our four principal foreign currencies are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the euro. Ongoing operating cost reductions and efficiencies. Our underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, have decreased to 16% of our revenues in 2004 from 18% in 1999. We continually focus on reducing our cost base while maintaining strong service levels for our customers. We expect to accomplish this goal in each of our operating units through a wide range of cost management disciplines, including consolidating operations, using low cost operating locations, reducing supplier costs, leveraging process improvement efforts, forming dedicated teams to identify opportunities for cost reductions and investing in new technology, particularly for web based, digital end to end processes. Developments affecting our product lines The following business trends and conditions have had a significant impact on our products during the last three years: Life insurance. Regulation XXX requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees. In response to this regulation, we increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves, implemented reinsurance and capital management actions and increased our premium rates for term life insurance products in March 2003. This increase in premium rates has contributed to lower term life insurance sales in 2003 and 2004. Our annualized first year premiums and deposits for term and universal life insurance products decreased by 16% from $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and by 12% to $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our pricing, reinsurance and capital management actions in response to Regulation XXX have collectively enabled us to improve our new business returns on equity, and in October 2003 and June 2004, we decreased our premium rates for term life insurance products. This decrease has led to an increase in term life insurance sales at the end of 2004. Our annualized first year premiums for term life insurance products increased by 42% from $19 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 to $27 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, and we further decreased our premium rates for term life insurance in January 2005. We believe our recent price reductions, together with ongoing service and distribution support initiatives, will continue to lead to increased term life insurance sales over time. Long term care insurance. Total individual long term care insurance premiums for in force policies in the U.S. increased from approximately $2.4 billion in 1997 to $6.8 billion in 2004, according to LIMRA International. Industry wide sales of individual long term care insurance peaked in 2002 at approximately $1.0 billion and decreased by 7% in 2003 and 25% in 2004. We believe this decrease was due primarily to decisions by several providers to cease offering long term care insurance, to raise premiums on in force policies, and or to introduce new products with higher prices. These actions resulted in decreased purchases of long term care insurance products and have caused some distributors to reduce their sales focus on these products. In addition, we have been experiencing lower lapse rates than we originally anticipated on long term care insurance policies that we issued prior to the mid 1990s. This has adversely affected our overall claims experience on those policies. In the third quarter of 2003, we started selling our newest long term care insurance products in selected states. These products were priced to achieve our target returns on capital and to reflect new features and benefits, trends in lapse rates, interest rates, morbidity and adverse claims experience in certain higher risk policyholder classes. Our pricing strategy for these products, along with declines in overall industry sales, have contributed to lower sales in recent periods. Our annualized first year premiums for the long term care business 99 Table of Contents decreased by 33% from $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In late fourth quarter of 2004, we began selling these products in the majority of the remaining states, and we expect there may be a similar adverse impact on sales in those states, potentially resulting in uneven sales in our long term care business. We believe that our pricing strategy is appropriate and that over time, the long term care insurance market will continue to expand as the result of aging demographics, increasing healthcare and nursing care costs, the uncertainty regarding government programs that currently cover these costs and the increasing public awareness of the benefits of private long term care insurance. On January 27, 2005 the NAIC Capital Adequacy Task Force recommended a new formula that ties the calculation of risk based capital for long term care insurance more closely to claims than to collected premiums, which is the current practice. The new formula is subject to approval by the NAIC. If approved, the new formula may enable us to release capital temporarily from our long term care insurance business for use in other business lines in December 2005. Payment protection insurance. Our payment protection insurance business has expanded as a result of our strategy to enter additional markets in Continental Europe and Ireland and to develop new relationships with distributors in those markets. However, the margins of our payment protection business in the U.K. have decreased in recent years as a result of increased pricing pressure and greater competition from captive insurance arrangements by distributors that provide payment protection insurance directly to their customers. As a result, in the third quarter of 2003, we evaluated our contractual relationships with our payment protection insurance distributors against our targeted return thresholds and decided to terminate or not to renew certain relationships that we refer to as run off. In the aggregate, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, in our payment protection insurance business decreased by 31% from $2,175 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,501 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. However, excluding run off business, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, increased by 21% from $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,441 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although we expect the total revenue from our payment protection business to continue to decline over the next few years as our run off business diminishes, we believe this will not have a material impact on our operating earnings and will have a favorable effect on our returns as capital is released and redeployed into markets with potential for higher growth and returns. Annuities. The results of our Retirement Income and Investments segment are affected primarily by interest rate fluctuations and volatile equity markets, as discussed above under Overview Business trends and conditions General conditions and trends affecting our businesses. In addition, our competitive position within many of our distribution channels depends significantly upon product features, including our crediting rates on spread based products relative to our competitors, minimum guaranteed rates, surrender charge periods and agent commissions. We continually evaluate our competitive position based upon each of those features, and we make adjustments as appropriate to meet our target return thresholds. For example, our deposits in fixed annuities increased by 67% from $1,028 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 to $1,719 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of our expanded distribution relationships with financial intermediaries and a new fixed annuity product we introduced in 2004 that incorporates flexible product features. We believe that a gradual increase in market interest rates will have a favorable impact on consumer demand for these products. We also recently introduced the Income Distribution Series of guaranteed income annuity products and riders that provide the contractholder with a guaranteed minimum income stream and an opportunity to participate in market appreciation but reduce some of the risks to insurers that generally accompany traditional products with guaranteed minimum income benefits. Sales of these products increased by 82% from $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $258 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our new deposits in variable annuities decreased by 48% from $2,048 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,075 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We believe this decline was primarily driven by a market shift to variable annuity products with certain guaranteed benefit features that we chose not to offer due to their risk profile. 100 Table of Contents Mortgage insurance. As discussed above under Overview Business trends and conditions General conditions and trends affecting our businesses, increasing interest rates in 2004 have contributed to a significant decrease in U.S. new mortgage insurance written. Our U.S. new insurance written also has been adversely affected by our actions in connection with our captive reinsurance arrangements. Starting in late 2003, we generally sought to exit or restructure a portion of our excess of loss risk sharing arrangements with premium cessions in excess of 25% to improve profitability. This resulted in a significant reduction in business from several of these lenders. We later re evaluated these relationships on a case by case basis, assessing various factors, including ceding terms, attachment points and quality of portfolios. As a result, we reinstated or restructured some of these arrangements in a form that we believe allows us to achieve acceptable returns. For the foregoing reasons, as well as the continued popularity of simultaneous second, or 80 10 10, loans as an alternative to private mortgage insurance, our U.S. new insurance written decreased by 58% from $67.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $28.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the significant U.S. refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 and the significant expansion of our international business in recent years, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 80% of our U.S. risk in force and 72% of our international risk in force had not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years, which are generally between the third and seventh year of the loan. We expect our loss experience on these loans will increase as policies continue to age. Our international mortgage insurance business has continued to expand and has had a favorable impact on our results of operations. International new insurance written increased by 32% from $39.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $51.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was driven by a larger mortgage origination market in Canada and increased account penetration in both Canada and Australia, as well as growth in new insurance written in Europe and favorable foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by a smaller mortgage origination market in Australia. We expect that the growth of our international mortgage insurance business will continue to contribute an increasing portion of this segments total revenues and profits. Separation from GE and related financial arrangements GE historically has provided a variety of products and services to us, and we have provided various products and services to GE. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a transition services agreement and various other agreements with GE that, together with a number of agreements that were in effect before the IPO, govern the relationship between GE and us. Services received from GE Support services and corporate overhead. GE historically has provided a variety of support services for our businesses, including: customer service, transaction processing and a variety of functional support services provided by an outsourcing provider in India that was wholly owned by GE until December 2004 and is now 40% owned by GE; employee benefit processing and payroll administration, including relocation, travel, credit card processing and related services; employee training programs, including access to GE training courses; insurance coverage under the GE insurance program; information systems, network and related services; leases for vehicles, equipment and facilities; and other financial advisory services such as tax consulting, capital markets services, research and development activities, and use of trademarks and licenses. We have reimbursed GE for the costs of providing these services to us. We paid GE a total of $65 million, $87 million and $74 million for these services for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 101 Table of Contents In addition, GE historically has allocated to us a share of its corporate overhead expenses for certain services provided to us, which are not specifically billed to us, including public relations, investor relations, treasury, and internal audit services. Our total expense for this allocation was $14 million, $50 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We have not reimbursed these amounts to GE, and have recorded them as a capital contribution in each year. Following the completion of the IPO, GE no longer allocates any of its corporate expenses to us. GE continues to provide us with many of the corporate services described above on a transitional basis, and we are arranging to procure other services pursuant to arrangements with third parties or through our own employees. In the aggregate, we expect that our total costs for procuring corporate services that previously had been provided by GE will not materially exceed the amounts we historically have paid to GE for these services, including GEs allocation to us for its corporate overhead. However, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental advertising, marketing, investor relations and legal entity transition expenses to establish a new brand identity. We also incurred compensation expense with respect to the establishment of our new equity plans. In addition, we have obtained direct access to a variety of third party products and services, including technology licenses, as a result of GEs relationships with those third parties. We have negotiated and are continuing to negotiate our own arrangements with third party providers for these products and services, and we do not believe these arrangements will result in materially increased costs in the aggregate. Investment management services. We have received and will continue to receive investment management services from GE Asset Management Incorporated, or GEAM, a subsidiary of GE, pursuant to agreements that were, with limited exceptions, amended in connection with the IPO. We also entered into new agreements with GE Asset Management Limited, or GEAML, an affiliate of GEAM, for investment management services in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Pursuant to these agreements, the fees charged by GEAM and GEAML are based on a percentage of the value of the assets under management. This percentage is established annually by agreement between us and GEAM or GEAML and is intended to reflect the cost to GEAM or GEAML of providing its services and, for the agreements with GEAML, a premium of 5%. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our aggregate costs for investment management and related administration services provided by GEAM and GEAML were approximately $33 million, $61 million and $39 million, respectively. Reinsurance transactions. In addition to our arrangements with UFLIC, we have entered into reinsurance transactions with affiliates of GE, principally Employers Reassurance Company and ERC Life Reinsurance Corporation (formerly an affiliate of GE), which we refer to collectively as ERC, under which we have reinsured some of the risks of our insurance policies on terms comparable to those we could obtain from third parties. We have paid premiums to these affiliates of $39 million, $56 million and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, in 2002, one of our subsidiaries entered into a life reinsurance agreement with an affiliated company, GE Pensions Limited, to reinsure 95% of our liabilities under certain life insurance policies. We have paid premiums to this affiliate of $100 million and $94 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This agreement was terminated as of December 31, 2003. Employee benefit plans. Historically, we have reimbursed GE for benefits it has provided to our employees under various employee benefit plans, including GEs retirement plan, retiree health and life insurance benefit plans, defined contribution savings plan and life and health insurance benefits through the GE benefit program. We incurred expenses associated with these plans of $108 million, $109 million and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. GE will continue to provide these benefits to our employees for so long as GE owns more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. See note 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition to these expenses for which we have reimbursed GE, we have incurred expenses of $2 million, $9 million and $6 million for certain GE stock option and restricted stock unit grants for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As in the case of the allocation of corporate overhead, we have not reimbursed these amounts with respect to stock options and restricted stock units to GE. In connection with the IPO, we established our own equity compensation plans. See Equity plans below. 102 Table of Contents Services provided to GE We have provided various products and services to GE on terms comparable to those we provide to third parties and we expect to continue to provide many of these products and services to GE. In addition, in connection with the IPO, we entered into a series of arrangements with GE pursuant to which we will provide a variety of additional services to GE, including the arrangements discussed below. The following describes the principal impact of those service arrangements on our results of operations: Transition services relating to GE and GEFAHI businesses not acquired by us. We provide services to certain of GEs insurance businesses that we did not acquire. These services include finance, information systems, network services and regulatory support. We continue to provide these services and will do so for a minimum of two years and a maximum of three years, in most cases, following the IPO. For the two years following the completion of the IPO, GE generally may not terminate any of the services we provide. GE has agreed to pay us $40 million in equal quarterly installments during each of the first two years following the completion of the IPO for our provision of the transition services to GE. The charges for the transition services generally are intended to allow the providing company to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services, plus all out of pocket costs and expenses, generally without profit. Management consulting services. We have agreed to provide certain management consulting services to GE for a period of five years following the IPO. These services include delivering training, providing consultation and strategic advice with respect to actuarial, regulatory and other emerging issues, planning and participating in meetings with rating agencies and regulators, participating in government relations activities and various other activities. In consideration for these services, GE will pay us a fee of $1 million per month during the first four years following the completion of the IPO and $0.5 million per month during the fifth year. GE cannot terminate this arrangement before the expiration of the five year term. GIC investment administration services. We entered into three agreements with affiliates of GE, effective as of January 1, 2004, to manage a pool of municipal guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, issued by those affiliates. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to originate GIC liabilities and advise the GE affiliates regarding the investment, administration and management of their assets that support those liabilities. Under two of those agreements, we receive an administration fee of 0.165% per annum of the maximum program size for those GE affiliates, which is $15 billion. The agreements also provide for termination fees in the event of early termination at the option of either affiliate. Under a third agreement with another affiliate, we receive a management fee of 0.10% per annum of the book value of the investment contracts or similar securities issued by this affiliate after January 1, 2003, which was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2004. The fee we receive on the contracts issued by that affiliate before January 1, 2003 is based upon a pricing arrangement that varies depending upon the maturities of those contracts and that affiliates cost of capital. The book value of the contracts issued before January 1, 2003 was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 and is expected to generate a weighted average fee of approximately 0.35% in 2005. We also will receive reimbursement of our operating expenses under each of the agreements. The initial term of each of the three agreements will expire December 31, 2006, and unless terminated at the option of either party, each agreement automatically will renew on January 1 of each year for successive terms of one year. Institutional asset management services. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we offered a broad range of institutional asset management services to third parties. GEAM provided the portfolio management services for this business, and we provided marketing, sales and support services. We did not acquire the institutional asset management services business from GEFAHI, but we continue to provide services to GEAM and GEFAHI related to this asset management business, including client introduction services, asset retention services and compliance support. GEFAHI has agreed to pay us a fee of up to $10 million per year for four years following the completion of the IPO to provide these services. The fee will be determined based upon the level of third party assets under management managed by GEAM over the four year term. The agreement may not be terminated by GEAM or GEFAHI, except for non performance or in the event that we commence a similar institutional asset management business. 103 Table of Contents Additional arrangements with GE In addition to the arrangements described above pursuant to which we and GE will provide services to each other, we also entered into the following additional arrangements with GE: Tax Matters Agreement. As a consequence of our separation from GE, and our election jointly made with GE to treat that separation as an asset sale under section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to become entitled to additional tax deductions for periods after our corporate reorganization. We expect to realize tax savings from these deductions and have recorded our estimate of these tax savings on our statement of financial position as a $718 million reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities. We are obligated, pursuant to our Tax Matters Agreement with GE, to pay to GE, on an after tax basis, 80% of the amount of tax we are projected to save for each tax period as a result of these increased tax benefits, up to a maximum of $640 million. We have recorded the $389 million present value of this obligation to GE as our estimate of this liability in our statement of financial position. Since our initial estimates recorded at the time of the IPO, our estimate of the expected tax savings has increased significantly, while the present value of our obligation to GE has increased slightly. This is because (1) a portion of the future savings now exceeds the $640 million maximum payment to GE, (2) the discount rate increased from that estimated at the time of the IPO, and (3) the average life of the obligation increased. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we would also be required to pay to GE additional amounts in the event we realize certain other contingent benefits, or if we choose to defer certain payments and thereby incur interest on any such deferrals. To the extent that we never realize the anticipated tax savings because we have insufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (or because of a reduction in tax rates), we may, at our option, defer payments until 2029. These deferred payments would bear interest over the term of the deferral at an interest rate of 5.72% per annum (estimated, in accordance with the Tax Matters Agreement, to be our cost of funds as of the date of our initial public offering for a borrowing of like duration) from the time that we were scheduled to make the payments. In certain circumstances, we may realize tax savings later than projected in calculating the schedule of corresponding payments to GE pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, but our payment schedule to GE would not be changed. In these circumstances, we will remain obligated to pay amounts to GE even before we realize the corresponding tax savings, although we can choose to defer such payments. There are two categories of such circumstances. First, in certain limited instances the Tax Matters Agreement establishes binding factual assumptions pursuant to which we are scheduled to make payments to GE in advance of the time we anticipate realizing the corresponding tax savings. We estimate that the interest expense we will incur with respect to such advance payments over the entire life of the Tax Matters Agreement, if we choose to defer them, will be approximately $25 million. The second, broader category of these circumstances are those situations in which our actual tax savings are delayed beyond the time we currently project for any reason other than a change in the tax returns on which the section 338 sales are reported. In the case of either the first or second category, we may defer the scheduled payments to GE until we actually realize the corresponding tax savings or, alternatively, we may make the payments from sources other than the projected tax savings. Any deferred payments would bear interest until made at the rate of 5.72% per annum. The $329 million difference between the $718 million benefit we have recorded as the expected future tax savings and the $389 million liability to GE we have recorded is part of our net stockholders interest. These amounts reflect considered judgments and assessments as to the underlying facts and assumptions. However, if and to the extent our final section 338 tax savings exceed (or fall short of) the amount of tax savings we currently project, our additional paid in capital would increase (or decrease) accordingly. As our obligation to make payments under the Tax Matters Agreement accretes over time, we will record interest expense at a rate of 5.72% per annum. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, GE also is responsible for certain taxes of our legal entities, other than taxes in respect of the section 338 elections described above, resulting from the various transactions implemented in connection with our 104 Table of Contents separation from GE (other than the reinsurance with UFLIC). We record (or will record) these non recurring taxes as a current tax expense (or benefit) when incurred, and we record (or will record) GEs payment of the taxes (or receipt of the benefit) as an equity contribution (or dividend). UFLIC reinsurance arrangements. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, an indirect subsidiary of GE. Under the terms of the agreements governing these reinsurance transactions, we transferred to UFLIC assets equal to the policyholder liabilities related to the ceded blocks of business and recorded a reinsurance recoverable asset for the amount of the policyholder liabilities reinsured, except with respect to the in force liabilities for the variable annuity separate accounts, for which there is no asset transfer. We will continue to have a separate account liability in the amount of the policyholder liabilities related to the separate account assets which we did not transfer to UFLIC. We remain liable under these contracts and policies as the ceding insurer and, as a result, will continue to carry insurance reserve liabilities for the reinsured policies on our balance sheet. In connection with the Medicare supplement insurance assumed by us, UFLIC transferred to us cash and other investments, and we recorded a reinsurance liability, equal to the policyholder liabilities related to this assumed block of business. As of December 31, 2004, our total reinsurance recoverable for all our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC was $16.2 billion. The reinsurance transactions have the effect of transferring the financial results of the reinsured blocks of business (except for Medicare supplement insurance) from us to UFLIC and the Medicare supplement insurance block of business from UFLIC to us. With respect to the long term care insurance policies reinsured to UFLIC, we retained an interest in the future profitability of the block if it exceeds certain thresholds. We also are continuing to administer all the policies reinsured by UFLIC, and we will receive an expense allowance to reimburse us for the costs we incur to service these policies. Equity plans Prior to the IPO, our key employees participated in a number of GEs equity compensation plans. For grants issued prior to January 1, 2002, we recorded compensation expense related to our employees participation in those plans over the vesting period of the awards based upon their intrinsic value at the grant date. For grants issued after January 1, 2002, we recorded compensation expense for share based compensation awards over the vesting period of the awards based upon their fair value at the grant date in accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In connection with the IPO, we established our own equity compensation plans. Under these plans, unvested GE stock options, vested stock options held by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, GE stock appreciation rights and GE restricted stock units were canceled and converted into awards of our company, and we also granted new stock options in our company in connection with our separation from GE and the IPO. The GE stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units were converted based upon a ratio equal to the initial offering price of our common stock in the IPO ($19.50), divided by the weighted average stock price of GE common stock for the trading day immediately preceding the pricing date of the IPO ($30.52). The converted securities, if unvested, generally continue to vest over their original vesting periods. The unvested converted awards had approximately the same fair value at the date of the conversion as the GE awards that were replaced. We incurred compensation expense of $29 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and expect to incur expenses of $41 million and $31 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, for 2004 and prior awards to our employees under these plans. Branding costs We expect to incur aggregate expenses of approximately $35 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 on marketing, advertising and legal entity transition expenses, relating to the costs of establishing our new brand throughout our business, including with sales intermediaries, employees, investors and consumers. 105 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be particularly critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and our managements best estimates may require adjustment. Reserves. We calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders and contractholders based on actuarial assumptions and in accordance with industry practice and U.S. GAAP. Many factors can affect these reserves, including economic and social conditions, inflation, healthcare costs, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Therefore, the reserves we establish are necessarily based on estimates, assumptions and our analysis of historical experience. Our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products. Our reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. Insurance reserves differ for long and short duration insurance policies and annuity contracts. Measurement of long duration insurance reserves (such as guaranteed renewable term life, whole life and long term care insurance policies) is based on approved actuarial methods, but necessarily includes assumptions about expenses, mortality, morbidity, lapse rates and future yield on related investments. Short duration contracts (such as payment protection insurance) are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that periods claims, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. Short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events. Estimates of mortgage insurance reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on notices of mortgage loan defaults and estimates of defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, using assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim. As is common accounting practice in the mortgage insurance industry and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, loss reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default. Deferred acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs, or DAC, represents costs which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts that are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. DAC is subsequently amortized to expense, over the lives of the underlying contracts, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits. The amortization of DAC for traditional long duration insurance products (including guaranteed renewable term life, life contingent structured settlements and immediate annuities and long term care insurance) is determined as a level proportion of premium based on commonly accepted actuarial methods and reasonable assumptions established when the contract or policy is issued about mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, expenses, and future yield on related investments. Amortization for annuity contracts without significant mortality risk and investment and universal life products is based on estimated gross profits and is adjusted as those estimates are revised. The DAC amortization methodology for our variable products (variable annuities and variable universal life insurance) includes a long term equity market average appreciation assumption of 8.5%. When actual returns vary from the expected 8.5%, we assume a reversion to this mean over a 3 to 7 year period, subject to the imposition of ceilings and floors. The assumed returns over this reversion period are limited to the 85th percentile of historical market performance. We regularly review all of these assumptions and periodically test DAC for recoverability. For deposit products, if the current present value of estimated future gross profits is less than the unamortized DAC for a line 106 Table of Contents of business, a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization. For other products, if the benefit reserves plus anticipated future premiums and interest earnings for a line of business are less than the current estimate of future benefits and expenses (including any unamortized DAC), a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization or for increased benefit reserves. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves. In recent years, the portion of estimated product margins required to amortize DAC and PVFP has increased in most lines of our business, with the most significant impact on investment products, primarily as the result of lower investment returns. Present value of future profits. In conjunction with the acquisition of a block of life insurance policies or investment contracts, a portion of the purchase price is assigned to the right to receive future gross profits arising from existing insurance and investment contracts. This intangible asset, called the present value of future profits, or PVFP, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. PVFP is amortized, net of accreted interest, in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC. We regularly review our assumptions and periodically test PVFP for recoverability in a manner similar to our treatment of DAC. Goodwill impairment. Goodwill resulting from acquisitions is tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge to income would be recorded. Valuation of investment securities. We obtain values for actively traded securities from external pricing services. For infrequently traded securities, we obtain quotes from brokers or we estimate values using internally developed pricing models. These models are based upon common valuation techniques and require us to make assumptions regarding credit quality, liquidity and other factors that affect estimated values. Impairment of investment securities. We regularly review investment securities for impairment in accordance with our impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security position is in an unrealized loss position, and for fixed maturities, whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent to hold the security until recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams, as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of GEAM and other third party managers, as required. We actively perform comprehensive market research, monitor market conditions and segment our investments by credit risk in order to minimize impairment risks. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Impairments of investment securities and note 6 to our financial statements. Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations The following table sets forth our historical and pro forma results of operations. The pro forma financial information reflects our historical results of operations as adjusted to reflect the various adjustments described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information. The pro forma financial information principally reflects the exclusion from our results of operations of the structured settlement, variable annuity and long term care insurance in force blocks that we ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions; the exclusion from our results of operations of certain businesses, including the Affinity segment, and other assets and liabilities of GEFAHI that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization; the inclusion in our results of operations of incremental interest expense associated with the consideration that we issued to GEFAHI in connection with our corporate reorganization, including $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock and the $550 million Contingent Note; and the issuance of $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. 107 Table of Contents Our historical results of operations include the results of operations of the Affinity segment and the blocks of business that we ceded to UFLIC through for all periods presented through May 24, 2004, the date of our corporate reorganization. Pro forma revenues and benefits and expenses (except interest expense) are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured blocks of business and the to the Affinity segment. Pro forma interest expense is higher than historical interest expense as the result of our revised capital structure following our corporate reorganization and the IPO. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 6,559 $ 6,707 $ 6,107 $ 6,388 Net investment income 3,648 4,051 3,979 3,160 Net realized investment gains 26 10 204 23 Policy fees and other income 824 915 939 664 Total revenues 11,057 11,683 11,229 10,235 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 4,804 5,270 4,640 4,340 Interest credited 1,432 1,624 1,645 1,319 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,812 1,916 1,808 1,657 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 1,154 1,351 1,221 1,052 Interest expense 217 140 124 243 Total benefits and expenses 9,419 10,301 9,438 8,611 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting change 1,638 1,382 1,791 1,624 Provision for income taxes 493 413 411 494 Net earnings from continuing operations before accounting change $ 1,145 $ 969 $ 1,380 $ 1,130 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Our premiums consist primarily of premiums earned on individual life, long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies, income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies and mortgage insurance policies. Premiums decreased $148 million, or 2%, to $6,559 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as the result of a $156 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $107 million decrease in our Protection segment, partially offset by an $84 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment and a $45 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investment segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in long term care insurance premiums as the result of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, as well as a decrease in payment protection insurance premiums as the result of the continued run off of low return books of business. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in international mortgage insurance premiums, attributable to the aging of our international in force block, which resulted in increased earned premiums from prior year new insurance written, offset in part by a decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums, attributable to decreased demand for mortgage insurance as the result of a smaller U.S. market for mortgage originations. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums from life 108 Table of Contents contingent income annuities attributable to new distribution relationships in 2004, offset in part by a decrease in premiums from life contingent structured settlements attributable to our decision to write those contracts only when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Net investment income. Net investment income represents the income earned on our investments. Net investment income decreased $403 million, or 10%, to $3,648 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $4,051 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease in net investment income was primarily the result of a decrease in average invested assets, primarily due to the transfer of assets to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions, partially offset by new asset purchases. The decrease in net investment income was also the result of a decrease in weighted average investment yields to 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in weighted average investment yields was primarily attributable to purchases of new assets in an interest rate environment where current market yields are lower than existing portfolio yields. Net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains consist of gross realized investment gains and gross realized investment (losses), including charges related to impairments. Net realized investment gains increased $16 million to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross realized gains and (losses) were $90 million and $(64) million, respectively. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $26 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($17 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the timber products, healthcare, consumer products industries ($6 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively). The equity securities impairments primarily related to mutual fund investments. The other investments impairments related to impairment of limited partnership investments. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross realized gains and (losses) were $473 million and $(463) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $43 million gain from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $224 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($126 million, $83 million and $15 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the transportation, mining and metals, utilities and energy and technology and communications industries ($36 million, $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively). In addition, $30 million of fixed maturities impairments were realized on asset backed securities. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($37 million and $46 million, respectively). The other investments impairments primarily related to impairment of limited partnership investments Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income consist primarily of cost of insurance and surrender charges assessed on universal life insurance policies, fees assessed against policyholder and contractholder account values, and commission income. Policy fees and other income decreased $91 million, or 10%, to $824 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of a $156 million decrease in our Affinity segment and a $12 million decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decreases were partially offset by a $46 million increase in our Corporate and Other segment, and a $28 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily the result of a decrease in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to lower refinancing activity in the U.S. The increase in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to a gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in commission income due to increased sales of third party products and fee income earned in connection with investment and administrative services related to a pool of municipal GICs issued by affiliates of GE, offset by a decrease in fee income attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. 109 Table of Contents Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves consist primarily of reserve activity related to current claims and future policy benefits on life, long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies, structured settlements and income annuities with life contingencies and claim costs incurred related to mortgage insurance products. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $466 million, or 9%, to $4,804 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $5,270 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $253 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, a $116 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $107 million decrease in our Protection segment and a $40 million decrease in our Corporate and Other segment, offset partially by a $50 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to a decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC and a reclassification of variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders, which were classified as underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, in 2003. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily related to a decrease in our payment protection insurance business attributable to the lower loss ratio in the payment protection insurance run off block. The decrease in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to lower litigation expenses and higher reserves at our Bermuda reinsurer. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in paid claims as well as an increase in loans in default associated with higher insurance in force in our international mortgage insurance business. Interest credited. Interest credited represents interest credited on behalf of policyholder and contractholder general account balances. Interest credited decreased $192 million, or 12%, to $1,432 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $189 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment that was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest credited associated with the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease in interest credited was also the result of lower interest credited on institutional products due to a decrease in the average size of the in force block. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, represent costs and expenses related to the acquisition and ongoing maintenance of insurance and investment contracts, including commissions, policy issue expenses and other underwriting and general operating costs. These costs and expenses are net of amounts that are capitalized and deferred, which are primarily costs and expenses which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts, such as first year commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and other policy issue expenses. These expenses decreased $104 million, or 5%, to $1,812 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $1,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as the result of a $121 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $37 million decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment and a $32 million decrease in our Corporate and Other Segment, partially offset by a $75 million increase in our Protection segment and a $11 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses primarily from lower underwriting expenses due to a decline in refinancing activity in the U.S., lower administrative costs and a decrease in the provision for indemnity liabilities related to a decline in mortgage loan origination. The decrease in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in allocated expenses from GE as the result of our corporate reorganization and lower litigation expenses. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to an increase in our payment protection insurance business related primarily to an increase in commissions and other compensation arrangements in our run off block, partially offset by decreased legal fees in our life insurance business following an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit in 2003 and lower other expenses and a decrease in the long term care business primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in commission and other expenses incurred in our fee based products primarily due to increased sales. 110 Table of Contents Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of acquisition costs that are capitalized and PVFP. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $197 million, or 15%, to $1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $132 million decrease in our Protection segment, a $58 million decrease in our Affinity segment, and a $20 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, partially offset by a $14 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in payment protection insurance due to our decision not to renew certain distribution relationships, partially offset by the impact of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The increase in the Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization reflecting higher than expected early year margins on recently written policies in the U.S. and the continued growth of our international business. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $77 million, or 55%, to $217 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization, as well as the full year contribution of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and interest paid on non recourse funding obligations issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $80 million, or 19%, to $493 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $413 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate increased to 30.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE, a decrease in benefits related to dividends received, and favorable examination developments in 2003, which did not recur in 2004, offset in part by tax benefits recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization. Net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $176 million, or 18%, to $1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects increases in segment net earnings in each of our segments, except for our Affinity segment, whose net earnings decreased as a result of its exclusion as a result of our corporate reorganization. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $600 million, or 10%, to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6,107 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $500 million increase in our Protection segment, a $58 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, and a $39 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to increases in payment protection insurance premiums as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates and growth of the in force block as well as growth in long term care insurance premiums. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in life contingent structured settlement premiums, offset in part by a decrease in life contingent income annuities. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in international mortgage insurance premiums, offset in part by a decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $72 million, or 2%, to $4,051 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $3,979 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in net investment income was primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in weighted average investment yields, primarily attributable to investments in the U.S., to 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002. 111 Table of Contents Net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains decreased $194 million to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross realized gains and (losses) were $473 million and $(463) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $43 million gain from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $224 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($126 million, $83 million and $15 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the transportation, mining and metals, utilities and energy and technology and communications industries ($36 million, $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively). In addition, $30 million of fixed maturities impairments were realized on asset backed securities. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($37 million and $46 million, respectively). The other investments impairments primarily related to impairment of limited partnership investments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross realized gains and (losses) were $790 million and $(586) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2002 included $29 million from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2002 included $343 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($193 million, $133 million and $17 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the technology and communications and airline industries ($131 million and $27 million, respectively). The technology and communication industry impairments include $83 million related to securities issued by WorldCom Inc. and its affiliates. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($81 million and $52 million, respectively). The other investments impairments are related to impairment of limited partnership and other private equity investments. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $24 million to $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $939 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $25 million decrease in our Protection segment and an $11 million decrease in our Affinity segment, partially offset by a $10 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business. The decrease in our Affinity segment was primarily attributable to the decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to higher contract underwriting fees related to increased refinancing activity in the U.S. and higher fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $630 million, or 14%, to $5,270 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $4,640 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $367 million increase in our Protection segment, a $117 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment and a $69 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to an increase in changes in policy reserves for long term care insurance, payment protection insurance and life insurance. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in changes in policy reserves for structured settlements. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to favorable loss development on prior year reserves. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $21 million, or 1%, to $1,624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,645 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $24 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment that was primarily attributable to lower credited rates on GICs and funding agreements, offset in part by an increase in interest credited resulting from more variable annuity policyholders selecting the fixed account option on their contracts, on which we credit interest. The decrease in interest credited was also the result of a reduction in our weighted average crediting rates to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. 112 Table of Contents Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, increased $108 million, or 6%, to $1,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,808 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $89 million increase in our Protection segment, a $66 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment, partially offset by a $68 million decrease in our Affinity segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to higher expenses associated with increased refinancing activity in the U.S., continued investment in our international mortgage insurance business and higher indemnity liabilities for U.S. contract underwriting claims, which are included as other liabilities in our statement of financial position. U.S contract underwriting indemnification claims arise out of our contract underwriting agreements, pursuant to which we agree to indemnify lenders against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors during the underwriting process. These claims are classified in this line item (and not in Benefits and other changes in policy reserves) because they do not relate to insured events. Our indemnification liabilities related to U.S. contract underwriting claims increased as the result of our updating the assumptions we used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans underwritten due to significant refinancing activity. The decrease in our Affinity segment was primarily attributable to cost saving initiatives that reduced compensation and benefits and other general expenses. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization increased $130 million, or 11%, to $1,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,221 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $155 million increase in our Protection segment, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to the impact of additional amortization in 2002 due to lower equity valuations of assets in our variable annuity separate accounts. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $16 million, or 13%, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $27 million of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003, and $3 million of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, supporting certain term life insurance policies. These increases were partially offset by a $14 million decrease in interest expense that was primarily the result of lower average short term borrowings and long term borrowings. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $2 million to $413 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a $152 million decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 that was attributable to a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to the treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders on life insurance contracts, partially offset by dividend received deduction benefits realized in 2003. Excluding the effect of the settlement, our effective tax rate would have been 29.9% and 31.4% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased by $411 million, or 30%, to $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,380 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in net realized investment gains and the impact of a favorable settlement with the IRS in 2002. The decline in net earnings from continuing operations reflects decreases in segment net earnings in our Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, Mortgage Insurance and Corporate and Other segments, partially offset by increased segment net earnings in our Affinity segment. 113 Table of Contents Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations by Segment Set forth below is historical financial information for each of our operating segments (Protection, Retirement Income and Investments and Mortgage Insurance), together with our Corporate and Other segment and the Affinity segment. Set forth below also is pro forma financial information for our Protection, Retirement Income and Investments and Corporate and Other segments. There were no pro forma adjustments to the results of operations of our Mortgage Insurance segment, and pro forma financial information is not provided for the Affinity segment because we did not acquire that segment from GEFAHI. All pro forma segment information is prepared on the same basis as the segment information presented in our unaudited financial statements. Management regularly reviews the performance of each of our operating segments based on the after tax net earnings (loss) of the segment, which excludes: (1) net realized investment gains (losses), (2) most of our interest and other financing expenses, (3) amounts reserved for the settlement in principle of the class action litigation relating to sales practices in our life insurance business, and (4) advertising and marketing costs and severance and restructuring charges. Although these excluded items are significant to our consolidated financial performance, we believe that the presentation of segment net earnings (loss) enhances our understanding and assessment of the results of operations of our operating segments by highlighting net earnings (loss) attributable to the normal, recurring operations of our business. However, segment net earnings (loss) is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Prior to our corporate reorganization, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions in which we ceded to UFLIC a block of long term care insurance policies that we reinsured from Travelers in 2000, and we assumed from UFLIC in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance policies. We ceded the Travelers long term care block to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore its results are not included in our historical results after that date. Similarly, we assumed the Medicare supplement blocks from UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore their results are included in our historical results after that date. As a result of the foregoing, our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The pro forma earnings information below reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions as if they had been effective as of January 1, 2004. There were no pro forma adjustments to interest credited or interest expense because the long term care insurance policies we ceded to UFLIC, and the Medicare supplement insurance policies UFLIC ceded to us, in connection with the reinsurance transactions do not generate such fees, interest credited or interest expense. Pro forma revenues and benefits and expenses are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured block of long term care insurance. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 4,481 $ 4,588 $ 4,088 $ 4,398 Net investment income 1,224 1,199 1,136 1,178 Policy fees and other income 359 356 381 359 Total revenues 6,064 6,143 5,605 5,935 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 2,890 2,997 2,630 2,788 Interest credited 362 365 362 362 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,094 1,019 930 1,077 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 869 1,001 846 861 Interest expense 15 3 15 Total benefits and expenses 5,230 5,385 4,768 5,103 Earnings before income taxes 834 758 837 832 Provision for income taxes 306 271 283 305 Segment net earnings $ 528 $ 487 $ 554 $ 527 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums decreased $107 million, or 2%, to $4,481 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $4,588 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $102 million decrease in long term care insurance premiums, consisting of a $124 million decrease attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by a $22 million increase in premiums associated with the growth of the in force block. The decrease was also the result of a $81 million decrease in payment protection insurance premiums, consisting of a $231 million decrease on a constant currency basis, net of a $150 million increase attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The $231 million decrease consisted of a $393 million decrease in premiums in our run off block, offset by a $162 million increase in our continuing business 115 Table of Contents due to new distribution relationships and the growth of consumer lending in Continental Europe. These decreases were offset in part by a $61 million increase in life insurance premiums that was primarily attributable to growth of the term life insurance in force block. The decreases were also offset in part by a $15 million increase in group life and health insurance premiums attributable to growth of the in force block that was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of non medical products as the result of enhancements in our life insurance and disability product offerings and the expansion of our dental network. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $25 million, or 2%, to $1,224 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,199 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase, which included $13 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets, offset in part by declining yields on investments and by a decrease in invested capital allocated to this segment in preparation for our corporate reorganization and initial public offering. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $3 million, or 1%, to $359 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $13 million increase in our life insurance business primarily attributable to an increase in policy fees and other income in our universal life insurance business. This increase was partially offset by a $9 million decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher lapse rates in 2004. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $107 million, or 4%, to $2,890 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $2,997 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $113 million decrease in our payment protection insurance business attributable to the lower loss ratio in the payment protection insurance run off block, $27 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was also attributable to a $85 million decrease in long term care benefits and other changes in policy reserves, consisting of a $150 million decrease primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by a $65 million increase primarily attributable to increased reserves and benefit payments resulting from the normal, expected increases in claims volume associated with the aging and continued growth of the long term care in force block. The decrease was partially offset by a $71 million increase in our life insurance business attributable to growth of the in force block and less favorable claim experience compared to 2003, as well as a $19 million increase in our group life and health insurance business primarily attributable to growth in the in force block and loss ratios that were more in line with expectations after favorable results in 2003. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $3 million, or 1%, to $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased crediting rates for universal life insurance policies, offset in part by increased policyholder account balances on corporate owned life insurance policies. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals increased $75 million, or 7%, to $1,094 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to an $116 million increase in our payment protection insurance business related primarily to an increase in commissions and other compensation arrangements in our run off block. This increase was partially offset by a $27 million decrease in our life insurance business primarily attributable to decreased legal fees following the agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit in 2003 and lower other expenses. The increase was also partially offset by an $18 million decrease in our long term care insurance business primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $132 million, or 13%, to $869 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $184 million decrease 116 Table of Contents in payment protection insurance due to our decision not to renew certain distribution relationships, partially offset by an increase of $69 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was also partially attributable to a $20 million decrease in our life insurance business due to lower 2004 lapses in our term life insurance block and lower amortization on our universal life insurance block due to additional investment income related to bond calls and favorable universal life insurance claims experience, both of which resulted in accelerated amortization in 2003 and did not recur in 2004. Long term care amortization decreased $3 million primarily as a result of a $14 million decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by an increase in our long term care business due to growth in the in force block. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $12 million to $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004, supporting certain term life insurance policies. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $35 million, or 13%, to $306 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 36.7% and 35.8% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased by $41 million, or 8%, to $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net earnings primarily reflects increases in net earnings in our life, payment protection and long term care insurance businesses, offset in part by a decrease in net earnings in our group life and health insurance business. The increase in life insurance was primarily attributable to growth of the in force block and lower legal expenses following the agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit. The increase in payment protection insurance was primarily attributable to $10 million in one time charges related to employee benefit costs, as well as an $8 million increase due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase due to growth in our continuing business, partially offset by the loss of certain foreign tax benefits. The increase in our long term care insurance business was primarily attributable to the growth of the block, partially offset by a loss of earnings on invested capital attributable to a reallocation of capital to our Corporate and Other segment and decreased earnings as a result of the reinsurance transactions. The decrease in our group life and health insurance business was attributable to loss experience that was more in line with expectations after favorable results in 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $500 million, or 12%, to $4,588 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $4,088 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $265 million increase in payment protection insurance premiums, with $155 million of that increase attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and $110 million of that increase attributable to growth of the in force block. The increase was also the result of a $232 million increase in long term care insurance premiums that was primarily attributable to growth of the in force block. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $63 million, or 6%, to $1,199 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,136 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in invested assets, offset in part by declining yields on investments in the lower interest rate environment. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $25 million, or 7%, to $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $13 million decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher lapse rates. 117 Table of Contents Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $367 million, or 14%, to $2,997 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,630 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $267 million increase in changes in reserves and benefit payments resulting from the normal, expected increases in claims volume associated with the aging of the long term care insurance in force block. The increase was also the result of a $69 million increase in changes in policy reserves attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block, of which $34 million was attributable to a lower amount of favorable loss development on prior year reserves, and a $38 million increase in life insurance reserves. Interest credited. Interest credited increased $3 million, or 1%, to $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of increased policyholder account balances on corporate owned life insurance policies, offset in part by decreased crediting rates for universal life insurance policies. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals increased $89 million, or 10%, to $1,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $930 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an $83 million increase attributable to growth in the payment protection insurance in force block that was primarily associated with an increase in net commission expense. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $155 million, or 18%, to $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $846 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $96 million increase resulting from growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The increase was also the result of a $33 million increase primarily attributable to additional investment income due to early bond calls within the universal life insurance investment portfolio and to favorable universal life insurance claims experience, both of which accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. In addition, $19 million of the increase was the result of the impact of the amortization of PVFP in 2002 for the block of long term care insurance reinsured from Travelers. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, supporting certain term life insurance policies. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $12 million, or 4%, to $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $283 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a decrease in certain foreign tax loss and dividend benefits. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased by $67 million, or 12%, to $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $554 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in segment net earnings primarily reflects decreases in net earnings for life, payment protection and group life and health insurance products, offset in part by increases in net earnings for long term care insurance products. The decrease in life insurance was primarily attributable to an increase in life insurance reserves, as well as accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles related to additional investment income resulting from early bond calls and favorable claims experience. The decrease in payment protection insurance was primarily attributable to higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, and the impact of the recognition in 2002 of certain foreign tax loss benefits. The decrease in group life and health insurance was primarily attributable to lower administration fees due to higher lapse rates. The increase in long term care insurance was primarily attributable to growth in the in force blocks. 118 Table of Contents Retirement Income and Investments segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Retirement Income and Investments segment. Prior to our corporate reorganization, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions in which we ceded to UFLIC all of our in force structured settlements contracts and substantially all of our in force variable annuity contracts. We ceded these blocks of business to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore their results are not included in our historical results after that date. As a result of the foregoing, our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The pro forma earnings information below reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions as if they had been effective as of January 1, 2004. Pro forma revenues (except premiums) and benefits and expenses are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured block of long term care insurance. There were no pro forma adjustments to premiums because the structured settlements we ceded are single premium products and do not have renewal premiums, and the variable annuity products we ceded are deposit contracts and their deposits are not recorded as premiums. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 1,094 $ 1,049 $ 991 $ 1,094 Net investment income 1,996 2,511 2,522 1,582 Policy fees and other income 271 243 243 215 Total revenues 3,361 3,803 3,756 2,891 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 1,633 1,886 1,769 1,352 Interest credited 1,070 1,259 1,283 957 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 250 239 221 229 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 170 190 210 122 Interest expense 1 1 Total benefits and expenses 3,124 3,574 3,483 2,661 Earnings before income taxes 237 229 273 230 Provision for income taxes 84 78 87 82 Segment net earnings $ 153 $ 151 $ 186 $ 148 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums increased $45 million, or 4%, to $1,094 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $68 million increase in premiums for life contingent income annuities that was primarily attributable to new distribution relationships in 2004. The increase was partially offset by a $23 million decrease in premiums for life contingent structured settlements that was primarily attributable to our decision to write those contracts only when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $515 million, or 21%, to $1,996 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of a decrease in average invested assets, primarily associated with assets transferred to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions, partially offset by new asset purchases. The decrease in net investment income also was the result of declining yields on investments. 119 Table of Contents Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $28 million, or 12%, to $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily attributable to a $38 million increase in commission income due to increased sales of third party products. The increase was also attributable to $34 million of fee income earned pursuant to new arrangements we entered into, effective as of January 1, 2004, to provide investment and administrative services related to a pool of municipal GICs issued by affiliates of GE. The increase was also attributable to a $10 million increase in fee income attributable to increased assets under management and a $10 million increase in asset management service fees. These increases were partially offset by a $62 million decrease in fee income primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $253 million, or 13%, to $1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $341 million decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease was also partially attributable to a $34 million reclassification in variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders, which were classified as underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, in 2003. This reclassification was the result of the adoption of SOP 03 1 on January 1, 2004. The decrease was partially offset by a $68 million increase in reserves relating to life contingent income annuities and a $17 million increase related to favorable mortality on income annuities in 2003 which did not recur in 2004. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a one time charge of $49 million, $41 million of which was recorded in benefits and other changes in policy reserves. This charge related to a small run off block of equity indexed annuities and resulted from an adjustment of reserving processes. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $189 million, or 15%, to $1,070 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,259 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $172 million decrease in interest credited as the result of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. This decrease was also the result of a $16 million decrease relating to lower interest credited on institutional products due to a decrease in the average size of the in force block, as well as lower average interest crediting rates. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, increased by $11 million, or 5%, to $250 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $32 million in commission and other expenses incurred in our fee based products primarily due to increased sales. The increase was also the result of the reclassification of $33 million of variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders which were classified as deferred acquisition costs in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a $45 million decrease in expenses associated with blocks of business ceded as part of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC and an $7 million decrease in guarantee fund assessments. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $20 million, or 11%, to $170 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $33 million decrease attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease was partially offset by $8 million of accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs associated with variable life insurance. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $6 million, or 8%, to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate increased to 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of the impact of higher dividends received deduction benefits related to separate account annuity products in 2003. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased $2 million, or 1%, to $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result 120 Table of Contents of lower expenses due primarily to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, offset by declining yields on invested assets. The increase in segment net earnings also was attributable to an increase in fees received under new contracts with GE to manage its municipal GIC business, as well as growth in our asset management businesses, growth in assets under management overall, and improved spreads, offset by a one time charge of $32 million (post tax) related to an adjustment of reserving processes related to a small run off block of equity indexed annuities. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $58 million, or 6%, to $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $991 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $92 million increase in premiums for life contingent structured settlements that was attributable to higher sales of this product. This increase was offset in part by a $31 million decrease in premiums for life contingent income annuities that was primarily attributable to lower sales of this product resulting from a reduction of crediting and payout rates in 2003 in the lower interest rate environment. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $11 million to $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of declining yields on investments, which was offset in part by an increase in invested assets. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income were unchanged at $243 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $117 million, or 7%, to $1,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,769 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $107 million increase in changes in policy reserves for structured settlements attributable to higher sales of this product. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $24 million, or 2%, to $1,259 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,283 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower credited rates on GICs and funding agreements attributable to the lower interest rate environment, offset in part by an increase in interest credited attributable to more variable annuity policyholders selecting the fixed account option on their contracts, on which we credit interest. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased by $18 million, or 8%, to $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in general operating expenses, offset in part by an increase in deferrals of acquisition costs resulting from increased sales of variable annuities with bonus features, for which a portion of the benefit expense is deferred and amortized over the life of the product. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $20 million, or 10%, to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the impact of a $26 million increase in additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2002 that was primarily attributable to lower equity valuations of assets in our variable annuity separate accounts. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $9 million, or 10%, to $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of the impact of higher dividends received deduction benefits related to separate account annuity products in 2002. 121 Table of Contents Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased $35 million, or 19%, to $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease in segment net earnings was primarily the result of lower policy fees and other income and declining yields on invested assets. The decrease in segment net earnings reflects decreases in net earnings for structured settlement, fixed annuity and GIC products and an increase in net earnings for variable annuity products. The decrease in structured settlements and GICs was primarily attributable to lower reinvestment rates. The decrease in fixed annuities was primarily attributable to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The increase in variable annuities was primarily attributable to tax benefits resulting from higher dividend deductions on our separate accounts. Mortgage Insurance segment The following table sets forth the historical results of operations relating to our Mortgage Insurance segment. The Mortgage Insurance segments results of operations are not affected by any of the pro forma adjustments. Years ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 800 $ 716 $ 677 Net investment income 254 218 231 Policy fees and other income 36 48 38 Total revenues 1,090 982 946 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 165 115 46 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 262 299 233 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 51 37 39 Total benefits and expenses 478 451 318 Earnings before income taxes 612 531 628 Provision for income taxes 186 162 177 Segment net earnings $ 426 $ 369 $ 451 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums increased $84 million, or 12%, to $800 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $125 million increase in premiums in our international mortgage insurance business, $35 million of which was attributable to favorable foreign exchange rates. The increase also was partially attributable to the aging of our international in force block, which resulted in increased earned premiums from prior year new insurance written. The increase in international premiums was partially offset by a $41 million decrease in our U.S. mortgage insurance premiums. This decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums was primarily the result of the decline in our in force block due to decreased demand for mortgage insurance as the result of a smaller market for mortgage originations, as well as a reduction in business from some mortgage lenders following our actions to restructure our captive reinsurance arrangements with premium risk cessions in excess of 25%. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $36 million, or 17%, to $254 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $32 million increase in investment income in our international business, $13 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates, related to the growth in invested assets. Investment income in 122 Table of Contents our U.S. mortgage insurance business increased $4 million due to increasing yields on invested assets. As discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources, our U.S. mortgage insurance business paid a $700 million dividend to our parent holding company in December 2004. This dividend reduced the invested assets in our U.S. mortgage insurance business at the end of 2004. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $12 million, or 25%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $19 million decrease in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to lower refinancing activity in the U.S. This decrease was offset in part by a $7 million increase in fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $50 million, or 43%, to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $28 million increase in U.S. paid losses and a $22 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in claims and loans in default associated with higher insurance in force in our international mortgage insurance business, $4 million of which was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, decreased $37 million, or 12%, to $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $299 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $54 million decrease in expenses primarily attributable to lower underwriting expenses due to a decline in refinancing activity in the U.S. and lower administrative costs, and a $17 million decrease in the provision for indemnity liabilities related to a decline in mortgage loan origination primarily attributable to decreased mortgage refinancing activity. These declines were offset in part by a $34 million increase in expenses to support the expansion of our international mortgage insurance business, $8 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $14 million, or 38%, to $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was partially attributable to a $6 million increase in mortgage insurance amortization in the U.S. primarily due to accelerated amortization reflecting higher than expected early year margins on recently written policies. The increase was also attributable to an $8 million increase in international insurance amortization due primarily to the continued growth of our international business, $2 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $24 million, or 15%, to $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 30.4% and 30.5% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes and an increase in the benefit of tax exempt investment income, offset by the loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE. Our Mortgage Insurance segments effective tax rate is below the statutory rate primarily as a result of tax exempt investment income. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased $57 million, or 15%, to $426 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase in segment net earnings was primarily attributable to a $58 million increase in net earnings attributable to continued growth in our international mortgage insurance business, $23 million of which was due to favorable foreign exchange rates. The relatively constant net earnings in our U.S. mortgage insurance business were primarily attributable to lower expenses, offset by a continued decrease in the in force block and an increase in our paid claims. 123 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $39 million, or 6%, to $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $677 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an $88 million increase in premiums in our international mortgage insurance business, $24 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. This increase in international premiums was offset in part by a $26 million decrease in premiums in our U.S. mortgage insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher premiums ceded in captive reinsurance transactions and a $23 million decrease in premiums that was primarily attributable to lower persistency resulting from increased refinancing activity. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $13 million, or 6%, to $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $42 million decrease in net investment income that was primarily attributable to a decrease in invested assets resulting from the payment of dividends by the U.S. mortgage insurance business to our holding company. The decrease was also the result of declining yields on investments. These decreases were offset in part by a $29 million increase in net investment income resulting from additional invested assets in our international mortgage insurance business, $10 million of which was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $10 million, or 26%, to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $5 million increase in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to higher refinancing activity in the U.S. and a $5 million increase in fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $69 million, or 150%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $60 million increase primarily attributable to a lower amount of favorable loss development on prior year reserves and a $9 million increase in paid claims on U.S. flow mortgage insurance offset in part by a $4 million decrease primarily attributable to favorable loss development on U.S. bulk mortgage insurance, and a $4 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in loans in default associated with higher insurance in force levels in our international mortgage insurance business. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased $66 million, or 28%, to $299 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $37 million increase in expenses that was primarily attributable to a significant increase in underwriting volume associated with refinancing activity in the U.S., an $11 million increase attributable to higher indemnity liabilities for U.S. contract underwriting claims as the result of updating of the assumptions we used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans underwritten due to significant refinancing activity and an $18 million increase attributable to continued investment in our international mortgage insurance business. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $2 million, or 5%, to $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the amortization of a lower amount of U.S. deferred expenses, offset by the higher volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $15 million, or 8%, to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 30.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a greater proportion of foreign income taxed at a higher rate than in the U.S. Our Mortgage Insurance segments effective tax rate is significantly below the statutory rate primarily as the result of tax exempt investment income. 124 Table of Contents Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased $82 million, or 18%, to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $141 million decrease in U.S. net earnings, offset in part by a $59 million increase in international net earnings. The decrease in U.S. net earnings was primarily attributable to greater losses from less favorable loss development on prior year reserves, decreases in premiums from increased ceding and lower persistency, and increases in underwriting expenses from refinancing activity and contract underwriting indemnification liabilities as the result of our updating the assumptions used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and increased volume. The increase in international net earnings was primarily the result of growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Affinity segment The following table sets forth the historical results of operations relating to the Affinity segment. Because we did not acquire any of the Affinity segment businesses from GEFAHI in our corporate reorganization, this segments results of operations are included in our results of operations only for periods through May 24, 2004 and are not included in our pro forma financial information. Years ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 88 $ 244 $ 247 Net investment income 26 62 70 Policy fees and other income 104 260 271 Total revenues 218 566 588 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 80 196 180 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 123 244 312 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 47 105 116 Total benefits and expenses 250 545 608 Earnings (loss) before income taxes (32 ) 21 (20 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (18 ) 5 (17 ) Segment net earnings (loss) $ (14 ) $ 16 $ (3 ) Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenues, benefits and expenses, provision (benefit) for income taxes and segment net earnings for the Affinity segment decreased because the Affinity segments results are not included in our results of operations for periods after May 24, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total revenues. Total revenues decreased $22 million, or 4%, to $566 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $588 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower premiums and other income attributable to our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in premiums attributable to a reinsurance transaction in which certain premiums were ceded to us by the purchaser of a discontinued operation. Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses decreased $63 million, or 10%, to $545 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $608 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships and implement cost savings initiatives that reduced compensation and benefits, as well as other general expenses. Our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships and implement cost savings initiatives also reduced 125 Table of Contents our deferrable expenses, resulting in a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in benefits and expenses attributable to a reinsurance transaction in which certain benefits and expenses were ceded to us by the purchaser of a discontinued operation. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes increased $22 million to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(17) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increased provision was the result of a foreign loss valuation allowance. Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) increased $19 million to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(3) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of our discontinuation of products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds and reductions of compensation and benefit expenses and other general expenses resulting from cost savings initiatives. Corporate and Other segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Corporate and Other segment. There were no pro forma adjustments to premiums or policy fees and other income because there are no premiums or policy fees and other income in the Corporate and Other segment that were ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions. Pro forma net investment income is lower than our historical net investment income primarily as a result of a decrease attributable to reduced net investment income related to the $1.836 billion capital contribution that we made to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization, offset in part by an increase attributable to net investment income earned on excess surplus assets that were transferred from the Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments to the Corporate and Other segment in 2004. Pro forma revenues are lower than our historical revenues primarily as a result of the adjustments to net investment income as described above, as well as the exclusion from our results of operations of net realized investment gains (losses) related to the long term care insurance, structured settlement and variable annuity blocks we ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions and net realized investment gains (losses) related to the Affinity segment. Pro forma expenses are higher than our historical expenses primarily as a result of the interest expense attributable to our debt structure following the IPO, including the offerings of senior notes and commercial paper. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 96 $ 110 $ 104 $ 96 Net investment income 148 61 20 146 Net realized investment gains 26 10 204 23 Policy fees and other income 54 8 6 54 Total revenues 324 189 334 319 Expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 36 76 15 35 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 83 115 112 89 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 17 18 10 18 Interest expense 201 137 124 227 Total expenses 337 346 261 369 Earnings (loss) before income taxes (13 ) (157 ) 73 (50 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (65 ) (103 ) (119 ) (79 ) Segment net earnings (loss) $ 52 $ (54 ) $ 192 $ 29 126 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums decreased $14 million, or 13%, to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased premiums from our Bermuda reinsurer attributable to the run off of certain credit life insurance blocks. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $87 million, or 143%, to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in investment income associated with an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments. The increase was also the result of a $28 million increase in interest income from two securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and an $18 million increase in partnership income. Net realized investment gains. See the comparison for this line item under Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $46 million to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This was primarily the result of a $40 million gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $40 million, or 53%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of lower litigation expenses and higher reserves at our Bermuda reinsurer. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, decreased $32 million, or 28%, to $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of $36 million lower allocated expenses from GE resulting from our corporate reorganization, $26 million of lower litigation expenses and $13 million of lower operating and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by expenses of $20 million relating to the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights in connection with our corporate reorganization and $23 million relating to the costs of establishing the Genworth brand. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $1 million, or 6%, to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $64 million, or 47%, to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of $45 million of interest expense associated with our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization and a $20 million increase attributable to the securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $38 million to ($65) million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from ($103) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decreased benefit was primarily due to a lower pre tax loss in 2004, a one time reduction in U.K. taxes related to the restructuring of our U.K. legal entities and favorable examination developments in 2003, which did not recur in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $47 million of tax benefits recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization. 127 Table of Contents Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) increased $106 million to $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $(54) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net earnings was primarily the result of an $87 million increase in net investment income primarily attributable to an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments, a $46 million tax benefit recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization, a $25 million after tax gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in 2004, and an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments partially offset by a $64 million increase in interest expense attributable to our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $6 million, or 6%, to $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $4 million increase in premiums attributable to our Mexican auto insurer. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $41 million, or 205%, to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $36 million increase relating to the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Net realized investment gains. See the comparison for this line item under Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $2 million to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $61 million, or 407%, to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of certain litigation settlements resulting in an increase in reserves, as well as increased claims in our Mexican auto insurer due to unfavorable weather conditions and increased costs in our Viking reinsurer relating to experience payments on previously novated businesses. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased $3 million, or 3%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $45 million higher litigation expense during 2003, partially offset by $11 million of miscellaneous asset write offs, $10 million of expenses associated with the relocation of our long term care insurance business and $21 million of higher operating expenses during 2002. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $8 million, or 80%, to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $13 million, or 10%, to $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $27 million of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. This increase was offset in part by a $14 million decrease in interest expense that was primarily the result of lower average borrowings. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $16 million to $(103) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(119) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This 128 Table of Contents decrease was the result of the recognition in 2002 of a favorable settlement with the IRS related to the treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders of life insurance contracts, offset in part by lower pre tax earnings, a one time reduction in U.K. taxes related to the restructuring of our U.K. legal entities, and increased dividends received deduction benefits. Changes to tax expense for our Corporate and Other segment are primarily the result of tax exempt investment income and other items not directly allocated to specific products or segments. Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) decreased $246 million to $(54) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in benefit for income taxes attributable to the impact of the 2002 favorable settlement with the IRS, the decrease in net realized investment gains and higher litigation reserves for the year ended December 31, 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We conduct all our operations through our operating subsidiaries. Dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations, including payments of principal and interest on the notes. Our primary uses of funds at our holding company level include payment of general operating expenses, payment of principal, interest and other expenses related to holding company debt, payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock, amounts we will owe to GE under the Tax Matters Agreement, contract adjustment payments on our Equity Units, contributions to subsidiaries, and, potentially, acquisitions. We currently pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate of $0.065 per share. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Our payment of dividends to our stockholders will depend partly upon our receipt of dividends from our insurance and other operating subsidiaries. In addition, our Series A Preferred Stock bears dividends at an annual rate of 5.25% of the liquidation value of $50 per share. We also pay quarterly contract adjustment payments with respect to our Equity Units at an annual rate of 2.16% of the stated amount of $25 per Equity Unit. We declared dividends of $171 million to our parent during 2002, of which $107 million was paid in 2002 and $64 million was paid in 2003. We declared and paid dividends of $3,168 million to our parent during 2003, including a dividend of $2,930 million paid on December 15, 2003. This dividend included the distribution of proceeds from the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which closed on August 29, 2003, and other dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries. During 2004, as part of our corporate reorganization and prior to the IPO, we paid dividends of $2,029 million to our parent. Since the completion of the IPO, we have declared a dividend on our common stock of $32 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2004. The fourth quarter dividend was paid in January 2005. The payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $2,111 million ($1,244 million of which were deemed extraordinary), $1,472 million ($1,400 million of which were deemed extraordinary) and $840 million ($375 million of which were deemed extraordinary), respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received dividends from insurance subsidiaries related to discontinued operations of $0, $495 million and $62 million, respectively. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, also are subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings. Based on statutory results as of December 31, 2004, our subsidiaries could pay dividends of $1,450 million to us in 2005 without obtaining regulatory approval. However, as a result of the dividends we paid in connection with our corporate reorganization, most of our insurance subsidiaries will not be able to pay us dividends until 129 Table of Contents April 15, 2005. As part of our corporate reorganization, we retained cash at the holding company level which we believe will be adequate to fund our dividend payments, debt service, obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement and other obligations until our insurance subsidiaries can resume paying ordinary dividends to us. In addition, we received a dividend of $700 million from our U.S. mortgage insurance business in December 2004 (included above in dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries) following the release of statutory contingency reserves from that business. We used $550 million of those proceeds to repay the Contingent Note, and we have retained the remaining $150 million in a segregated account at our holding company to pay debt servicing expenses and dividends on our common stock. Of this amount, we expect that $50 million will be available for disbursement during 2005, and $100 million will be available for disbursement during 2006. In addition to dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, our other sources of funds will include service fees we receive from GE, as described under Overview Separation from GE and related financial arrangements Services provided to GE, payments from our subsidiaries pursuant to tax sharing arrangements, borrowings pursuant to our credit facilities, and proceeds from any additional issuance of commercial paper. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion note and the $550 million Contingent Note. As described above, the Contingent Note was repaid in December 2004 with a portion of the proceeds of a $700 million dividend paid to us by our U.S. mortgage insurance business. We repaid the $2.4 billion note upon the completion of the IPO with borrowings under a short term credit facility. We repaid those borrowings shortly thereafter with proceeds from our offering of $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. The $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes includes $500 million LIBOR Floating Rate Notes due 2007, $500 million 4.75% Notes due 2009, $600 million 5.75% Notes due 2014, and $300 million 6.50% Notes due 2034. As a result of hedging arrangements entered into with respect to these securities, our effective interest rates are 3.53% on the 2007 notes, 4.48% on the 2009 notes, 5.51% on the 2014 notes and 6.35% on the 2034 notes. The commercial paper was issued under a $1 billion commercial paper program that we have established. We may issue additional commercial paper under this program from time to time. The liabilities we assumed from GEFAHI include the Yen Notes, which are &yen;60 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.60% notes due 2011 issued by GEFAHI, &yen;3 billion of which GEFAHI held and transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. In the third quarter of 2004, we retired the &yen;3 billion of Yen Notes that were transferred to us. We have entered into arrangements to swap our obligations under the Yen Notes to a U.S. dollar obligation with a principal amount of $491 million and bearing interest at a rate of 4.84% per annum. In connection with our corporate reorganization, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with GE, which represents an obligation by us to GE that is estimated to have a present value of approximately $389 million. In connection with our corporate reorganization, we also entered into $2 billion of revolving credit facilities, including a $1.0 billion 364 day facility and a $1.0 billion five year facility. The revolving credit facilities support our commercial paper program and provide us with liquidity to meet general funding requirements. We expect to replace the 364 day facility upon its expiration with a similar or longer term credit facility. Our ability to borrow under these facilities and to issue commercial paper in excess of $500 million in the aggregate may be subject to GEs right as the holder of the Class B Common Stock to approve our incurrence of debt in excess of $700 million outstanding at any one time (subject to certain exceptions). We believe our revolving credit facilities, further issuances under our commercial paper program and anticipated cash flows from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. For further information about our borrowings, see note 14 to our financial statements, included in Item 8. of this Annual Report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,498 million, $3,716 million and $4,883 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums received, fees received and investment income. Principal sources of cash include sales 130 Table of Contents of our products and services. The increase in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 of $1,782 million and the decrease in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 of $1,167 million was primarily the result of the timing of cash settlement for other assets and liabilities. As an insurance business, we typically generate positive cash flows from operating and financing activities, as premiums and deposits collected from our insurance and investment products exceed benefits paid and redemptions, and we invest the excess. Accordingly, in analyzing our cash flow we focus on the change in the amount of cash available and used in investing activities. Net cash from investing activities was $(5,404) million, $(681) million and $(6,525) million for the years December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, of $4,723 million was primarily the result of a $1,621 million decrease in cash provided by the proceeds from the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses in 2003 that did not recur in 2004 and an increase of $2,057 million in net investment purchases. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, of $5,844 million was the result of both less cash provided by operating activities of $1,167 million, as discussed above, and more cash used in financing activities of $5,007 million. Within our investing activities, during 2003, we received $2,126 million of proceeds and dividends associated with the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses. Net cash from financing activities was $(791) million, $(2,714) and $2,293 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Changes in cash from financing activities primarily relate to the issuance and repayment of borrowings, dividends to our stockholders and other capital transactions, as well as the issuance of, and redemptions and benefit payments on, investment contracts. The $1,923 million increase in cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, was primarily the result of an increase in net cash flows from our stockholder, primarily in transactions related to our corporate reorganization, of $2,430 million, as well as the issuance of long term borrowings of $1,895 million and lower net redemptions and deposits in investment contracts of $678 million, partially offset by the decrease in net short term borrowings of $2,713 million and the repayment of the $550 million Contingent Note. The decrease in cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, of $5,007 million was primarily the result of both lower deposits and higher redemptions of investment contracts, as a result of the lower interest rate environment, equity market downturns and volatility and pricing actions we took. These factors contributed to a decrease in the use of net cash from investment contracts by $3,202 million. In addition, dividends paid to our stockholder, net of capital contributions received, increased by $2,871 million. These increased uses of cash were partially offset by a net increase in cash provided from borrowings of $1,066 million, consisting of a net increase in short term borrowings, including commercial paper, of $466 million, and an increase in non recourse funding obligations of $600 million. The liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries principally relate to the liabilities associated with their various insurance and investment products, operating costs and expenses, the payment of dividends to us, contributions to their subsidiaries, payment of principal and interest on their outstanding debt obligations and income taxes. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment products include the payment of benefits, as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders and withdrawals, policy loans and obligations to redeem funding agreements under applicable put option provisions. Historically, our insurance subsidiaries have used cash flow from operations and sales of investment securities to fund their liquidity requirements. Our insurance subsidiaries principal cash inflows from operating activities derive from premiums, annuity deposits and policy and contract fees and other income, including commissions, cost of insurance, mortality, expense and surrender charges, contract underwriting fees, investment management fees, and dividends and distributions from their subsidiaries. The principal cash inflows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, sales of invested assets and investment income. 131 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $2.8 billion of renewable floating rate funding agreements, which are deposit type products that generally credit interest on deposits at a floating rate tied to an external market index. Purchasers of renewable funding agreements include money market funds, bank common trust funds and other short term investors. Some of our funding agreements contain put provisions, through which the contractholder has an option to terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contracts specified notice period, which is generally 90 days. Of the $2.8 billion aggregate amount outstanding as of December 31, 2004, $1.6 billion had put option features, none of which were less than 90 days. GE Capital has guaranteed certain obligations under floating rate funding agreements with a final maturity on or before June 30, 2005. This guarantee covers our obligations to contractholders and requires us to reimburse GE Capital for any payments made to contractholders under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2004, GE Capitals guarantee covered $1.4 billion of outstanding floating rate funding agreements. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain investment strategies intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. Products having liabilities with longer durations, such as certain life insurance and long term care insurance policies, are matched with investments having similar estimated lives such as long term fixed maturities and mortgage loans. Shorter term liabilities are matched with fixed maturities that have short and medium term fixed maturities. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries hold highly liquid, high quality short term investment securities and other liquid investment grade fixed maturities to fund anticipated operating expenses, surrenders, and withdrawals. As of December 31, 2004, our total cash and invested assets was $67.1 billion. Our investments in privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests and restricted investments held by securitization entities are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented approximately 30% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2004. Total assets were $103.9 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $103.4 billion as of December 31, 2003. Total assets remained relatively unchanged, with an increase in assets primarily attributable to normal business growth, partially offset by a decrease of $5.7 billion of assets that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. Total liabilities were $91.0 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $87.6 billion as of December 31, 2003. This increase of $3.4 billion was primarily due to growth in contractholder liabilities, as well as the issuance of $600 million of our Equity Units and $100 million of our mandatorily redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, partially offset by the tax impact of our corporate reorganization and other liabilities that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. Contractual obligations We enter into obligations to third parties in the ordinary course of our operations. These obligations, as of December 31, 2004, are set forth in the table below. However, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations. The most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers. Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, also will vary based upon our future needs. Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. Examples of fixed obligations include our obligations to pay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings. Examples of obligations that will vary include obligations to pay interest on variable rate borrowings and insurance liabilities that depend on future interest rates and market performance. Many of our obligations are linked to cash generating contracts. These obligations include payments to contractholders that assume those contractholders will continue to make deposits in accordance with the terms of their contracts. In addition, our operations involve significant expenditures that are not based upon commitments. These include expenditures for income taxes and payroll. 132 Table of Contents Payments due by period (Dollar amounts in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 and thereafter Borrowings(1) $ 4,606 $ 559 $ 500 $ 1,100 $ 2,447 Operating lease obligations 139 29 47 37 26 Purchase obligations(2) 289 149 56 48 36 Insurance liabilities(3) 60,643 10,060 13,623 10,393 26,567 Other contractual liabilities(4) 625 31 41 54 499 Total contractual obligations $ 66,302 $ 10,828 $ 14,267 $ 11,632 $ 29,575 (1) Includes principal of our short and long term borrowings, non recourse funding obligations, senior notes underlying equity units and mandatorily redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, as described in note 14 to our financial statements. Any payment of principal of, including by redemption, or interest on, the non recourse funding obligations is subject to regulatory approval. (2) Includes contractual purchase commitments; excludes funding commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business. (3) Includes guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements, structured settlements and income annuities (including contracts we ceded to UFLIC, because we remain the primary obligor under those contracts), based upon scheduled payouts, as well as those contracts with reasonably determinable cash flow, such as deferred annuities, universal life, term life, long term care, whole life and other life insurance contracts. (4) Because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following non current liabilities are excluded from this table: deferred taxes (except the Tax Matters Agreement, which is included, as described in note 15 to our financial statements), derivatives, deferred revenue and certain other items. Impairments of Investment Securities We regularly review investment securities for impairment in accordance with our impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position, and for fixed maturities, whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Our qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent to hold the security until recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams, as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of GEAM and other third party asset managers, as required. Our qualitative review attempts to identify those issuers with a greater than 50% chance of default in the coming twelve months. These securities are characterized as at risk of impairment. As of December 31, 2004, securities at risk of impairment had aggregate unrealized losses of approximately $50 million. For fixed maturities, we recognize an impairment charge to earnings in the period in which we determine that we do not expect either to collect principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments or to recover based upon underlying collateral values, considering events such as a payment default, bankruptcy or disclosure of fraud. For equity securities, we recognize an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that the security will not recover to book value within a reasonable period. We determine what constitutes a reasonable period on a security by security basis based upon consideration of all the evidence available to us, including the magnitude of an unrealized loss and its duration. In any event, this period does not exceed 18 months for common equity securities. We measure impairment charges based upon the difference between the book value of a security and its fair value. Fair value is based upon quoted market price, except for certain infrequently traded securities where we estimate values using internally developed pricing models. These models are based upon common valuation techniques and require us to make assumptions regarding credit quality, liquidity and other factors that affect estimated values. The carrying value of infrequently traded securities as of December 31, 2004 was $12.3 billion. 133 Table of Contents For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized impairments of $26 million and $224 million, respectively. We generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they recover. However, from time to time, we sell securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio to meet diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the pre tax realized investment loss incurred on the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities was $38 million. The aggregate fair value of securities sold at a loss during twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 billion, which was approximately 98.6% of book value. The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values of our investment securities, aggregated by investment type and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004: Less Than 12 Months (Dollar amounts in millions) Amortized costor cost Estimated fairvalue Grossunrealizedlosses % below cost # of securities Description of Securities Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agencies $ 115 $ 114 $ (1 ) 0.9 % 15 State and municipal 89 88 (1 ) 1.1 % 28 Government non U.S. 225 222 (3 ) 1.3 % 32 U.S. corporate 3,496 3,426 (70 ) 2.0 % 400 Corporate non U.S. 1,224 1,207 (17 ) 1.4 % 155 Asset Backed 857 853 (4 ) 0.5 % 125 Mortgage Backed 2,807 2,776 (31 ) 1.1 % 259 Subtotal, fixed maturities 8,813 8,686 (127 ) 1.4 % 1,014 Equities securities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 % Below cost fixed maturities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 8,799 $ 8,678 $ (121 ) 1.4 % 1,002 20 50% Below cost 14 8 (6 ) 42.9 % 6 &gt;50% Below cost 6 Total fixed maturities 8,813 8,686 (127 ) 1.4 % 1,014 % Below cost equity securities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 7 $ 7 $ 12 20 50% Below cost &gt;50% Below cost 1 Total equity maturities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 Investment grade $ 8,026 $ 7,930 $ (96 ) 1.2 % 869 Below investment grade 600 575 (25 ) 4.2 % 114 Not Rated Fixed maturities 187 181 (6 ) 3.2 % 31 Not Rated Equities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 134 Table of Contents 12 Months or More (Dollar amounts in millions) Amortized costor cost Estimated fairvalue Grossunrealizedlosses % below cost # of securities Description of Securities Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agencies $ 3 $ 3 $ 1 State and municipal 1 1 2 Government non U.S. 106 106 30 U.S. corporate 834 763 (71 ) 8.5 % 127 Corporate non U.S. 181 176 (5 ) 2.8 % 35 Asset Backed 55 54 (1 ) 1.8 % 5 Mortgage Backed 244 233 (11 ) 4.5 % 78 Subtotal, fixed maturities 1,424 1,336 (88 ) 6.2 % 278 Equities securities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 % Below cost fixed maturities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 1,319 $ 1,262 $ (57 ) 4.3 % 234 20 50% Below cost 95 69 (26 ) 27.4 % 23 &gt;50% Below cost 10 5 (5 ) 50.0 % 21 Total fixed maturities 1,424 1,336 (88 ) 6.2 % 278 % Below cost equity securities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 21 $ 20 $ (1 ) 4.8 % 8 20 50% Below cost 2 1 (1 ) 50.0 % 10 &gt;50% Below cost 1 Total equity maturities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 Investment grade $ 973 $ 934 $ (39 ) 4.0 % 188 Below investment grade 450 401 (49 ) 10.9 % 88 Not Rated Fixed maturities 1 1 2 Not Rated Equities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 for less than twelve months account for $127 million, or 58%, of our total unrealized losses. Of the securities in this category, there were three securities with an unrealized loss in excess of $5 million. These three securities had aggregate unrealized losses of $18 million. The amount of the unrealized loss on these securities is driven primarily by the relative size of the holdings, the par values of which range from $15 million to $386 million, the maturities, which range from 2010 to 2036, and the credit quality of the issuers. The issuer of the investment scheduled to mature in 2010 prepaid the related principal and interest along with a prepayment fee in January 2005. The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 for twelve months or more account for $90 million, or 42%, of our total unrealized losses. There are 104 fixed maturities in four industry groups that account for $54 million, or 60%, of the unrealized losses in this category. Forty four of these 104 securities are in the finance and insurance sector. Within this sector, no single issue has unrealized losses greater than $5 million. The unrealized losses of these securities are due primarily to changes in interest rates from the time the securities were purchased. Thirty five of these 104 securities are in the transportation sector and are related to the airline industry. All of our airline securities, with one exception, are collateralized by commercial jet aircraft associated with several 135 Table of Contents domestic airlines and one cargo airline. The collateral underlying these securities consists of commercial jet aircraft, except for one that is secured by airline ticket receivables. We believe these security holdings are in a temporary loss position as a result of ongoing negative market reaction to difficulties in the commercial airline industry. Within this sector, we have recognized $1 million and $36 million of other than temporary impairments in 2004 and 2003, respectively. These holdings were written down to estimated fair value based upon the present value of expected cash flows associated with revised lease terms or the value of the underlying aircraft. As of December 31, 2004, we expect to collect full principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments of our remaining holdings in airline securities. For those airline securities that we have previously impaired, we expect to recover our carrying amount based upon underlying aircraft collateral values. Fourteen of these 104 securities are in the consumer non cyclical sector, of which there was one issuer with unrealized losses in excess of $5 million. This issuer, which had a $7 million unrealized loss, is in the tobacco industry, is current on all terms, shows improving trends with regards to liquidity and security price and is not considered at risk of impairment. Each of the other securities in this sector has unrealized losses of less than $5 million. Eleven of these 104 securities are in the consumer non cyclical sector, of which there was one issuer with unrealized losses in excess of $5 million. The aggregate par value of securities was $37 million. This issuer is current on all terms and is not considered at risk of impairment. In the remaining industry sectors, as of December 31, 2004, one issuer of fixed maturity securities had an unrealized loss of $5 million. This issuer is current on all terms, has sufficient liquidity to service current debt obligations and is seeking additional financing. No other single issuer of fixed maturities in these sectors has an unrealized loss of greater than $5 million. The equity securities in an unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004, for twelve months or more are primarily preferred stocks with fixed maturity like characteristics. No single security had an unrealized loss greater than $2 million. Off balance Sheet Transactions We have used off balance sheet securitization transactions to mitigate and diversify our asset risk position and to adjust the asset class mix in our investment portfolio by reinvesting securitization proceeds in accordance with our approved investment guidelines. We have not used securitization transactions to provide us with additional liquidity, and we do not anticipate using securitization transactions for that purpose in the future. The transactions we have used involved securitizations of some of our receivables and investments that were secured by commercial mortgage loans, fixed maturities or other receivables, consisting primarily of policy loans. Total securitized assets remaining as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were $1.6 billion. Securitization transactions resulted in net gains, before taxes, of approximately $43 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and were included in net realized investment gains (losses) in our financial statements. There were no securitization transactions in the year ended December 31, 2004. We have arranged for the assets that we have transferred in securitization transactions to be serviced by us directly or pursuant to arrangements and with General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Servicing activities include ongoing review, credit monitoring, reporting and collection activities. We have entered into credit support arrangements in connection with our securitization transactions. Pursuant to these arrangements, as of December 31, 2004, we provided limited recourse for a maximum of $119 million of credit losses. To date, we have not yet been required to make payments under any of these credit support agreements. The agreements will remain in place throughout the life of the related entities. 136 Table of Contents GE Capital, our indirect parent and majority stockholder, provides credit and liquidity support to a funding conduit it sponsored, which exposes it to a majority of the risks and rewards of the conduits activities and therefore makes GE Capital the primary beneficiary of the funding conduit. Upon adoption of FIN 46, GE Capital was required to consolidate the funding conduit because of this financial support. As a result, assets and liabilities of certain previously off balance sheet securitization entities, for which we were the transferor, were required to be included in our financial statements because the funding conduit no longer qualified as a third party. Because these securitization entities lost their qualifying status, we were required to include $1.2 billion of securitized assets and $1.1 billion of associated liabilities in our Statement of Financial Position in July 2003. The assets and liabilities associated with these securitization entities have been reported in the corresponding financial statement captions in our Statement of Financial Position, and the assets are noted as restricted due to the lack of legal control we have over them. These balances will decrease as the assets mature because we will not sell any additional assets to these consolidated entities. Our inclusion of these assets and liabilities does not change the economic or legal characteristics of the asset sales. Liabilities of these consolidated entities will be repaid with cash flows generated by the related assets. Credit recourse to us remains limited to the credit support described above. We included $36 million of revenue, $2 million of general expenses and $27 million of interest expense associated with these newly consolidated entities in our historical financial statements for the period from July 1 to December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we included $64 million of revenue, $3 million of general expenses and $47 million of interest expense associated with these entities in our historical financial statements. Our consolidation of these securitization entities had no effect on our previously reported earnings. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities associated with the securitization entities we included in our Statement of Financial Position, which are part of our Corporate and Other segment as of the dates indicated: December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Assets: Restricted investments held by securitization entities $ 860 $ 1,069 Other assets 24 65 Total(1) $ 884 $ 1,134 Liabilities: Borrowings related to securitization entities $ 849 $ 1,018 Other liabilities 3 59 Total $ 852 $ 1,077 (1) Includes $31 million and $51 million of retained interests in securitized assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, that are consolidated. Seasonality In general, our business as a whole is not seasonal in nature. However, in our Mortgage Insurance segment, the level of defaults, which increases the likelihood of losses, tends to decrease in the first and second quarters of the calendar year and increase in the third and fourth quarters. As a result, we have experienced lower levels of losses resulting from defaults in the first and second quarters, as compared with the third and fourth quarters. Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our historical results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates. 137 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Currently effective In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03 1 (SOP 03 1), Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts, which we adopted on January 1, 2004. SOP 03 1 provides guidance on separate account presentation and valuation, accounting for sales inducements to contractholders and classification and valuation of long duration contract liabilities. Prior to adopting SOP 03 1 we held reserves for the higher tier annuitization benefit on two tiered annuities. To record these reserves in accordance with SOP 03 1, we released $10 million, or 7%, of our two tiered annuity reserves and $3 million of guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves. After giving effect to the impact of additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to these reserve releases, we recorded a $5 million benefit in cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of taxes, which is not reflected in net earnings from continuing operations. Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123R Share Based Payments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, which we will adopt on July 1, 2005. This statement provides additional guidance on accounting for share based payments and will require all such awards to be measured at fair value with the related compensation cost recognized in income on a prospective basis. We currently recognize compensation cost using the fair value method for all stock based awards issued after January 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded. The following is a discussion of our market risk exposures and our risk management practices. We enter into market sensitive instruments primarily for purposes other than trading. The carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $66 billion and $79 billion, respectively, of which 80% and 83%, respectively, was invested in fixed maturities. The primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities. We mitigate the market risk associated with our fixed maturities portfolio by closely matching the duration of our fixed maturities with the duration of the liabilities that those securities are intended to support. The primary market risk for our long term borrowings and Equity Units is interest rate risk at the time of maturity or early redemption, when we may be required to refinance these obligations. We continue to monitor the interest rate environment and to evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. We are exposed to equity risk on our holdings of common stocks and other equities. We manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. We also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Our international operations generate revenues denominated in local currencies, and we invest cash generated outside the U.S. in non U.S. denominated securities. Although investing in securities denominated in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, we remain exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our historical combined financial statements. We currently do not hedge this exposure. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 29% and 26%, respectively, of our net earnings from continuing operations were generated by our international operations. 138 Table of Contents We use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate and currency swaps, currency forwards and option based financial instruments, as part of our risk management strategy. We use these derivatives to mitigate certain risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk and equity risk, by: reducing the risk between the timing of the receipt of cash and its investment in the market; matching the currency of invested assets with the liabilities they support; converting the asset duration to match the duration of the liabilities; reducing our exposure to fluctuations in equity market indices that underlie some of our products; and protecting against the early termination of an asset or liability. As a matter of policy, we have not and will not engage in derivative market making, speculative derivative trading or other speculative derivatives activities. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market rates or prices on the profitability of market sensitive financial instruments. The following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices is based on so called shock tests, which model the effects of interest rate, foreign exchange rate and equity market price shifts on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe shock tests provide the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, they are constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. Although the following results of shock tests for changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices may have some limited use as benchmarks, they should not be viewed as forecasts. These forward looking disclosures also are selective in nature and address only the potential impacts on our financial instruments. They do not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of these changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity market prices. One means of assessing exposure of our fixed maturities portfolio to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential changes in market value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points across all maturities. This is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve. Under this model, with all other factors constant and assuming no offsetting change in the value of our liabilities, we estimated that such an increase in interest rates would cause the market value of our fixed income securities portfolio to decline by approximately $2.9 billion, based on our securities positions as of December 31, 2004. One means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis. We analyzed our combined currency exposure as of December 31, 2004, including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges to identify assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their relevant functional currencies. Net unhedged exposures in each currency were then remeasured, generally assuming a 10% decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Under this model, with all other factors constant, we estimated as of December 31, 2004, that such a decrease would have an insignificant effect on our net earnings from continuing operations. One means of assessing exposure to changes in equity market prices is to estimate the potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 10%. Under this model, with all other factors constant, we estimated that such a decline in equity market prices would cause the market value of our equity investments to decline by approximately $8 million, 139 Table of Contents based on our equity positions as of December 31, 2004. In addition, fluctuations in equity market prices affect our revenues and returns from our separate account and private asset management products, which depend upon fees that are related primarily to the value of assets under management. Counterparty credit risk We manage counterparty credit risk on an individual counterparty basis, which means that gains and losses are netted for each counterparty to determine the amount at risk. When a counterparty exceeds credit exposure limits (see table below) in terms of amounts owed to us, typically as the result of changes in market conditions, no additional transactions are executed until the exposure with that counterparty is reduced to an amount that is within the established limit. All swaps are executed under master swap agreements containing mutual credit downgrade provisions that provide the ability to require assignment or termination in the event either party is downgraded below Moodys A3 or S&Ps A . Swaps, purchased options and forwards with contractual maturities longer than one year are conducted within the credit policy constraints provided in the table below. Our policy permits us to enter into derivative transactions with counterparties rated A3 by Moodys and A by S&P if the agreements governing such transactions require both parties to provide collateral in certain circumstances. Our policy further requires foreign exchange forwards with contractual maturities shorter than one year to be executed with counterparties having a credit rating by Moodys of A 1 and by S&P of P 1 and the credit limit for these transactions is $150 million per counterparty. Counterparty credit criteria Credit Rating Moodys Standard& Poors Term of transaction Up to five years Aa3 AA Greater than five years Aaa AAA Credit exposure limit without collateral (1) Up to $50 million Aa3 AA Up to $75 million Aaa AAA Credit exposure limit with collateral (1) Up to $5 million A3 A Up to $50 million Aa3 AA Up to $100 million Aaa AAA (1) Credit exposure limits noted in this table are set by GE Capital and apply in the aggregate to all companies that are consolidated into GE Capital.

See note 5 to our financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. (2) During 2000, we consummated three significant business combinations: In July 2000, we reinsured 90% of Travelers long term care insurance portfolio and acquired certain related assets for $411 million; In April 2000, we acquired Phoenix American Life Insurance Company for $284 million; and Effective March 2000, we acquired the insurance policies and related assets of Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company. Our Japanese life insurance business assumed $21.6 billion of policyholder liabilities and $0.3 billion of accounts payable and accrued expenses and acquired $20.3 billion in cash, investments and other tangible assets through this transaction. We sold this business on August 29, 2003, and its results have been presented as discontinued operations. (3) As of January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and, in accordance with its provisions, discontinued amortization of goodwill. Goodwill amortization was $84 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, excluding goodwill amortization included in discontinued operations. (4) Net operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1,044 million. We define net operating earnings as pro forma net earnings from continuing operations, excluding pro forma after tax net realized investment gains and 88 Table of Contents losses (which can fluctuate significantly from period to period), changes in accounting principles and non recurring, infrequent or unusual items. There were no non recurring, infrequent or unusual items excluded from pro forma net operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004, other than an IPO related net tax benefit and a gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global business processing operation, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004. We believe that analysis of net operating earnings enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. However, net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. In addition, our definition of net operating earnings may differ from the definitions used by other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of pro forma net operating earnings (as defined above) to pro forma net earnings from continuing operations: (Dollar amounts in millions) Year endedDecember 31, 2004 Pro forma net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,130 Pro forma net realized (gains) on investments, net of taxes (15 ) Net tax benefit related to initial public offering (46 ) Gain on outsourcing services agreement, net of taxes (25 ) Net operating earnings $ 1,044 (5) Basic and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 are calculated by dividing the net earnings from continuing operations by 489.5 million weighted average basic shares outstanding and by 490.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Basic and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002 were calculated by dividing net earnings from continuing operations by 489.5 million pro forma shares outstanding. The number of shares used in our calculation of diluted earnings per share increased in 2004 due to additional shares of Class A Common Stock issuable under stock options and restricted stock units and is calculated using the treasury method. (6) Reflects the results of businesses that were owned by GEFAHI but were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization, including (a) the Partnership Marketing Group business, (b) an institutional asset management business, and (c) several other small businesses that were not part of our core ongoing business. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Our historical and pro forma financial information. (7) For a description of the non recourse funding obligations, see note 14 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. (8) Includes statutory capital and surplus and statutorily required contingency reserves held by our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In December 2004, our U.S. mortgage insurance business released $700 million of statutory contingency reserves and paid that amount as a dividend to the holding company of that business. 89 Table of Contents Pro Forma Financial Information Year ended December 31, 2004 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Historical Pro forma adjustments excluded assets and liabilities  Pro forma adjustments reinsurance transactions Pro forma adjustments capital structure Pro forma Revenues: Premiums $ 6,559 $ (80 )(a) $ (91 )(d) $ $ 6,388 Net investment income 3,648 (27 )(a) (431 )(d) 3,160 (1 )(b) (29 )(e) Net realized investment gains 26 (3 )(c) 23 Policy fees and other income 824 (103 )(a) (57 )(d) 664 Total revenues 11,057 (214 ) (608 ) 10,235 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 4,804 (71 )(a) (393 )(d) 4,340 Interest credited 1,432 (113 )(d) 1,319 Underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,812 (117 )(a) (38 )(d) 1,657 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 1,154 (46 )(a) (56 )(d) 1,052 Interest expense 217 (40 )(f) 243 12 (g) 9 (h) 45 (i) Total benefits and expenses 9,419 (234 ) (600 ) 26 8,611 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 1,638 20 (8 ) (26 ) 1,624 Provision for income taxes 493 14 (a) (4 )(d) (8 )(j) 494 (1 )(c) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,145 $ 7 $ (4 ) $ (18 ) $ 1,130 Net earnings from continuing operations per share: Basic $ 2.34 $ 2.31 Diluted $ 2.33 $ 2.30 Number of shares outstanding: Basic 489.5 489.5 Diluted 490.5 490.5 90 Table of Contents Notes to unaudited pro forma financial information (a) Reflects adjustments to exclude amounts included in our historical earnings relating to results of operations of businesses (formerly reported in our Affinity segment) that were not transferred to us. The exclusion of these businesses from our historical financial statements was accounted for as a pre IPO dividend to GEFAHI in 2004. (b) Reflects adjustments to exclude amounts included in our historical earnings relating to results of operations of certain investment partnerships that were not transferred to us. The exclusion of these partnerships from our historical financial statements was accounted for as a pre IPO dividend to GEFAHI in 2004. (c) Reflects adjustments to exclude amounts included in our historical earnings relating to net realized investment (gains) losses and related income tax benefits, attributable to sales of Affinity segment assets. In our historical financial statements, net realized (gains) losses are reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. (d) Reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions we entered into with, and the related contribution we made to, UFLIC, an indirect subsidiary of GE. As part of these transactions, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under our structured settlement contracts and our variable annuity contracts. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under a block of long term care insurance policies. As part of the reinsurance transactions, UFLIC ceded to us substantially all of its in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance. Prior to the completion of our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, the results of operation of UFLIC were included in our historical results. The unaudited pro forma earnings information gives effect to the reinsurance transactions as if each occurred as of January 1, 2004 and excludes the effects of all ceded reinsured contracts that were issued before January 1, 2004. We have continued to sell variable annuities and structured settlements after completion of the reinsurance transactions and we are retaining that business for our own account, subject to third party reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Under the reinsurance transactions, we receive an expense allowance to reimburse us for costs we incur to service the reinsured blocks. Actual costs and expense allowance amounts will be determined by expense studies to be conducted periodically. The pro forma adjustments have been prepared assuming that actual costs incurred during the pro forma periods, as determined under our historical cost structure and allocation methods, were reimbursed by an expense allowance. (e) Concurrently with the reinsurance transactions described in note (d), we contributed $1.836 billion of capital to UFLIC, which primarily represented the excess statutory capital in our insurance subsidiaries, after giving effect to the reinsurance transactions. Because a significant portion of the assets contributed to UFLIC were not owned for the entire period from January 1, 2004 until the date of the capital contribution, the pro forma adjustments to reduce net investment income and net realized investment gains related to the transferred assets were based upon a proportional allocation of investment income from the investment assets historically identified as (1) supporting the blocks of business reinsured in the reinsurance transactions, and (2) representing surplus of the subsidiaries providing assets that were contributed to UFLIC. (f) Reflects adjustments to exclude the interest expense included in our historical earnings, adjusted for qualified hedge effects, on commercial paper issued by GEFAHI of $1,696 million and short term borrowings from GE Capital of $800 million. The commercial paper, short term borrowings and related derivative contracts liabilities were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. (g) Reflects adjustments to record (1) interest expense and contract adjustment payments on $600 million of our Equity Units and (2) dividends payable on $100 million of our mandatorily redeemable Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock. The senior notes forming part of the Equity Units accrue interest at the rate of 3.84% per year, and the purchase contracts forming part of the Equity Units accrue contract adjustment payments at the rate of 2.16% per year. The Series A Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 5.25% per year, which is recorded as interest expense. Both the Equity Units and the Series A Preferred Stock were issued to 91 Table of Contents GEFAHI on May 24, 2004 in connection with our corporate reorganization, and the interest expense and contract adjustment payments on these securities are included in our historical financial results from that date. GEFAHI sold all the Equity Units and Series A Preferred Stock in public offerings concurrent with our IPO. (h) Reflects adjustments to record interest expense on our obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement with GE. Interest accretion on the Tax Matters Agreement is reflected in our historical financial results from May 24, 2004, the date of our corporate reorganization, at the rate of 5.72% per year. (i) Reflects adjustments to record interest expense, net of the impact of hedging arrangements, on long term borrowings pursuant to $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper.

Overview Our business We are a leading insurance company in the U.S., with an expanding international presence. We have three operating segments: Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, and Mortgage Insurance. Protection. We offer U.S. customers life insurance, long term care insurance and, primarily for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, group life and health insurance. In Europe, we offer payment protection insurance, which helps consumers meet their payment obligations in the event of illness, involuntary unemployment, disability or death. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Protection segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $527 million. Retirement Income and Investments. We offer U.S. customers fixed and variable deferred annuities, income annuities, variable life insurance, asset management and specialized products, including guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and structured settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Retirement Income and Investments segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $148 million. Mortgage Insurance. In the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, we offer mortgage insurance products that facilitate homeownership by enabling borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Mortgage Insurance segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $426 million. We also have a Corporate and Other segment, which consists primarily of unallocated corporate income and expenses (including amounts accrued in settlement of class action lawsuits), the results of small, non core businesses that are managed outside our operating segments, most of our interest and other financing expenses and net realized investment gains (losses). For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Corporate and Other segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $29 million. Our corporate reorganization We were incorporated in Delaware on October 23, 2003 in preparation for our corporate reorganization and the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GEFAHI. GEFAHI is an indirect subsidiary of GE and prior to the completion of the IPO, was a holding company for a group of companies that provide life insurance, long term care insurance, group life and health insurance, annuities and other investment products and U.S. mortgage insurance. We also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the Genworth management team. These businesses include international mortgage insurance, payment protection insurance based in Europe, a Bermuda reinsurer and mortgage contract underwriting. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion short term note and a $550 million contingent non interest bearing note. We refinanced the $2.4 billion note with $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper shortly after the IPO, and we repaid the contingent note in December 2004. 94 Table of Contents Our historical and pro forma financial information The historical financial information has been derived from our financial statements, which have been prepared as if Genworth had been in existence throughout all relevant periods. Our historical financial information and statements include all businesses that were owned by GEFAHI, including those that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization, as well as the other insurance businesses that we acquired from other GE subsidiaries in connection with our corporate reorganization. In addition to our three operating segments and our Corporate and Other segment, our historical financial statements also include the results of (1) the Partnership Marketing Group business, which offers life and health insurance, auto club memberships and other financial products and services directly to consumers through affinity marketing arrangements with a variety of organizations, (2) an institutional asset management business owned by GEFAHI, and (3) several other small businesses owned by GEFAHI that are not part of our core ongoing business. The Partnership Marketing Group historically included UFLIC, a subsidiary that offered life and health insurance products through affinity marketing arrangements. In connection with the IPO, GEFAHI transferred UFLIC to General Electric Capital Services, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of GE. We did not acquire the Partnership Marketing Group business, the institutional asset management business or these other small businesses from GEFAHI, and their results are presented as a separate operating segment under the caption Affinity. Our historical financial statements also include our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which we sold on August 29, 2003, and which are presented in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations. The unaudited pro forma information presented herein reflects our historical financial information, as adjusted to give effect to the transactions described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2004. Revenues and expenses Our revenues consist primarily of the following: Protection. The revenues in our Protection segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on individual life, individual long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies; net investment income on the separate investment portfolio held by our payment protection insurance business or allocated to this segments other lines of business; and policy fees and other income, including fees for mortality and surrender charges primarily from universal life insurance policies, and other administrative charges. Retirement Income and Investments. The revenues in our Retirement Income and Investments segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies; net investment income allocated to this segment; and policy fees and other income, including surrender charges, mortality and expense charges, investment management fees and commissions. Mortgage Insurance. The revenues in our Mortgage Insurance segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on mortgage insurance policies; net investment income on the segments separate investment portfolio; and policy fees and other income, including fees from contract underwriting services. 95 Table of Contents Corporate and Other. The revenues in our Corporate and Other segment consist primarily of: net premiums, policy fees and other income from the insurance businesses in this segment; unallocated net investment income; and net realized investment gains (losses). We allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Protection (except payment protection insurance) and Retirement Income and Investments segments using an approach based principally upon the investment portfolio established to support each of those segments products and targeted capital levels. We do not allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Mortgage Insurance segment or to our payment protection insurance product within the Protection segment, because they have their own separate investment portfolios, and the net investment income from those portfolios is reflected in the Mortgage Insurance and Protection segment results. In our historical financial statements, we allocated net investment income to our Affinity segment in the same manner that we allocated these items to our Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments. All net realized investment gains (losses) are reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and are not reflected in the results of any of our other segments. Our expenses consist primarily of the following: benefits provided to policyholders and contractholders and changes in reserves; interest credited on general account balances; underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, including commissions, marketing expenses, policy and contract servicing costs, overhead and other general expenses that are not capitalized (shown net of deferrals); amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other intangible assets; interest and other financing expenses; and income taxes. We allocate corporate expenses to each of our operating segments based on the amount of capital allocated to that segment. Business trends and conditions In recent years, our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry wide and product specific trends and conditions. Market and economic environment Aging U.S. population with growing retirement income needs. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, from 1945 to 2003, U.S. life expectancy at birth increased from 62.9 years to 74.4 years for men and from 68.4 years to 79.5 years for women, respectively, and life expectancy is expected to increase further. In addition, increasing numbers of baby boomers are approaching retirement age. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the percentage of the U.S. population aged 55 or older will increase from approximately 22% (65 million) in 2004 to more than 29% (97 million) in 2020. These increases in life expectancy and the average age of the U.S. population heighten the risk that individuals will outlive their retirement savings. In addition, approximately $4.4 trillion of invested financial assets (25% of all U.S. invested financial assets) are held by people within 10 years of retirement and will be available to be converted to income as those people retire, and approximately $3.3 trillion of invested financial assets are held by individuals who are under age 70 and consider themselves retired, in each case according to a survey conducted by SRI Consulting Business Intelligence in 2002. We believe these trends will lead to growing demand for retirement income and investment products, such as our annuities and other investment products, that help consumers accumulate assets and provide reliable retirement income. 96 Table of Contents Growing lifestyle protection gap. The aging U.S. population and a number of other factors are creating a significant lifestyle protection gap for a growing number of individuals. This gap is the result of individuals not having sufficient resources, including insurance coverage, to ensure that their future assets and income will be adequate to support their desired future lifestyle. Other factors contributing to this gap include declining individual savings rates, rising healthcare and nursing care costs, and a shifting of the burden for funding protection needs from governments and employers to individuals. Recent reductions in employer paid benefits by many companies, coupled with uncertainty over the future of government benefit programs, underscore the potential for long term benefit reductions from these traditional sources and the potential need for individuals to identify alternative sources of these benefits. At the same time, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal savings rates decreased from 10.8% in 1984 to 1.0% in 2004. Consumers are exposed to the rising costs of healthcare and nursing care during their retirement years, and some experts believe that many consumers are underinsured with respect to their protection needs. We expect these trends to result in increased demand for our life, long term care and small group life and health insurance products. Increasing opportunities for mortgage insurance internationally and in the U.S. We believe a number of factors have contributed and will contribute to the growth of mortgage insurance in Canada, Australia and the U.S., where we have significant mortgage insurance operations. These factors include increasing homeownership levels (spurred in part by government housing policies that favor homeownership and demographic factors driving demand for housing); expansion of low down payment mortgage loan offerings; legislative and regulatory policies that provide capital incentives for lenders to transfer the risks of low down payment mortgages to mortgage insurers; and expansion of secondary mortgage markets that require credit enhancements, such as mortgage insurance. We believe a number of these factors also are becoming evident in some European, Latin American, and Asian markets, where lenders increasingly are using mortgage insurance to manage the risks of their loan portfolios and to expand low down payment lending. General conditions and trends affecting our businesses Interest rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a significant effect on our sales of insurance and investment products and our margins on these products. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. In our Retirement Income and Investments and Protection segments, low market interest rates may reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to policyholders and contractholders and the yield we earn on the investments that support these obligations. In response to the unusually low interest rates that have prevailed during the last several years, we have reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on newly issued fixed annuity contracts and have reduced crediting rates on in force contracts where permitted to do so. These actions have helped mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our spreads and profitability on these products. A gradual increase in interest rates generally would have a favorable effect on the profitability of these products. However, rapidly rising interest rates also could result in reduced persistency in our spread based retail products as contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. In our Protection segment, the pricing and expected future profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products are based in part on expected investment returns. Over time, term life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as we receive them. Low interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products. The impact of interest rate fluctuations on our universal life insurance products is similar to their impact on spread based products in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. In our Mortgage Insurance segment, increasing interest rates in 2004 have contributed to a decrease in new mortgage originations in the U.S. and a resulting decrease in new mortgage insurance written. Our U.S. new insurance written decreased by 58% from $67.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $28.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily because of increased interest rates. Higher interest rates in 2004 and 97 Table of Contents the significant refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 also resulted in reduced refinancing activity in 2004, which had a positive impact on U.S. flow persistency. U.S. flow persistency rates increased from 46% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 65% for the year ended December 31, 2004, excluding the effect of a periodic payoff reconciliation on one structured transaction involving single premium mortgage insurance that today would be classified as bulk insurance. We expect that continued interest rate increases will have a favorable impact on persistency and an adverse impact on new mortgage originations and new mortgage insurance written. Volatile equity markets. Equity market volatility may discourage purchases of separate account products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products. Equity market volatility also affects the value of the assets in our separate accounts, which, in turn, affects our earnings from fee based products. After several years of declines, equity markets increased in 2003 and 2004, and we expect that increases or relative stability in equity markets could have a favorable impact on our sales of variable products and our earnings from those products. The potential impact of volatile equity markets on our results has been significantly reduced as a result of our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC, pursuant to which we reinsured, effective as of January 1, 2004, substantially all of our in force blocks of variable annuities. We retain variable annuities sold after January 1, 2004 for our own account, subject to third party reinsurance transactions in the ordinary course of business, and therefore we bear the risk of any adverse impact of future equity market fluctuations on those annuities. In addition, fluctuations in the equity markets may affect revenues and returns from our private asset management products and services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management. Credit default risk. As a result of the economic downturn in 2000 through 2002 and some high profile corporate bankruptcies and scandals, the number of companies defaulting on their debt obligations increased dramatically in 2001 and 2002. These defaults and other declines in the value of some of our investments resulted in impairment charges. Credit defaults have decreased in recent years as the economy has improved. Charges associated with impairments of investments were $26 million, $224 million, and $343 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A weakening in the economic recovery could lead to increased credit defaults. Investment portfolio. The yield on our investment portfolio is affected by the practice, prior to our separation from GE, of realizing investment gains through the sale of appreciated securities and other assets during a period of historically low interest rates. This strategy had been pursued to offset impairments and losses in our investment portfolio, fund consolidations and restructurings in our business and provide current income. Our gross realized gains were $473 million and $790 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This strategy has had an adverse impact on the yield on our investment portfolio and our net investment income as we typically sold higher yielding securities and reinvested the proceeds in lower yielding securities during periods of declining or low interest rates. The impact is most significant in the Retirement Income and Investments segment, which has a higher percentage of our fixed maturities allocated to it than to our other segments. Since our separation from GE, our investment strategy has been to optimize investment income without relying on realized investment gains. As a result, our gross realized gains decreased to $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We also are currently experiencing a challenging interest rate environment in which the yields that we can achieve on new investments are lower than the aggregate yield on our existing portfolio. This environment has resulted in a decline in our overall investment yield, from 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 5.8% and 5.5% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We seek to mitigate this decline in investment yields by continuously evaluating our asset class mix, pursuing additional investment classes and accepting additional credit risk when we believe that it is prudent to do so. A continued increase in prevailing interest rates also will mitigate this decline, whereas a decrease in interest rates could lead to further declines. Globalization. Historically, we have derived a majority of our revenues and profits from our operations in the U.S. However, in recent years, our international business has grown and has had an increasing impact on our 98 Table of Contents financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 19%, 18% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and 29%, 26% and 12% of our net earnings from continuing operations, respectively, were generated by our international operations. These increases were largely due to growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Our payment protection insurance business also derives revenues in the countries where it offers its products. We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our financial statements. As a result, period to period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $31 million and $25 million, respectively, due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our four principal foreign currencies are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the euro. Ongoing operating cost reductions and efficiencies. Our underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, have decreased to 16% of our revenues in 2004 from 18% in 1999. We continually focus on reducing our cost base while maintaining strong service levels for our customers. We expect to accomplish this goal in each of our operating units through a wide range of cost management disciplines, including consolidating operations, using low cost operating locations, reducing supplier costs, leveraging process improvement efforts, forming dedicated teams to identify opportunities for cost reductions and investing in new technology, particularly for web based, digital end to end processes. Developments affecting our product lines The following business trends and conditions have had a significant impact on our products during the last three years: Life insurance. Regulation XXX requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees. In response to this regulation, we increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves, implemented reinsurance and capital management actions and increased our premium rates for term life insurance products in March 2003. This increase in premium rates has contributed to lower term life insurance sales in 2003 and 2004. Our annualized first year premiums and deposits for term and universal life insurance products decreased by 16% from $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and by 12% to $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our pricing, reinsurance and capital management actions in response to Regulation XXX have collectively enabled us to improve our new business returns on equity, and in October 2003 and June 2004, we decreased our premium rates for term life insurance products. This decrease has led to an increase in term life insurance sales at the end of 2004. Our annualized first year premiums for term life insurance products increased by 42% from $19 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 to $27 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, and we further decreased our premium rates for term life insurance in January 2005. We believe our recent price reductions, together with ongoing service and distribution support initiatives, will continue to lead to increased term life insurance sales over time. Long term care insurance. Total individual long term care insurance premiums for in force policies in the U.S. increased from approximately $2.4 billion in 1997 to $6.8 billion in 2004, according to LIMRA International. Industry wide sales of individual long term care insurance peaked in 2002 at approximately $1.0 billion and decreased by 7% in 2003 and 25% in 2004. We believe this decrease was due primarily to decisions by several providers to cease offering long term care insurance, to raise premiums on in force policies, and or to introduce new products with higher prices. These actions resulted in decreased purchases of long term care insurance products and have caused some distributors to reduce their sales focus on these products. In addition, we have been experiencing lower lapse rates than we originally anticipated on long term care insurance policies that we issued prior to the mid 1990s. This has adversely affected our overall claims experience on those policies. In the third quarter of 2003, we started selling our newest long term care insurance products in selected states. These products were priced to achieve our target returns on capital and to reflect new features and benefits, trends in lapse rates, interest rates, morbidity and adverse claims experience in certain higher risk policyholder classes. Our pricing strategy for these products, along with declines in overall industry sales, have contributed to lower sales in recent periods. Our annualized first year premiums for the long term care business 99 Table of Contents decreased by 33% from $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In late fourth quarter of 2004, we began selling these products in the majority of the remaining states, and we expect there may be a similar adverse impact on sales in those states, potentially resulting in uneven sales in our long term care business. We believe that our pricing strategy is appropriate and that over time, the long term care insurance market will continue to expand as the result of aging demographics, increasing healthcare and nursing care costs, the uncertainty regarding government programs that currently cover these costs and the increasing public awareness of the benefits of private long term care insurance. On January 27, 2005 the NAIC Capital Adequacy Task Force recommended a new formula that ties the calculation of risk based capital for long term care insurance more closely to claims than to collected premiums, which is the current practice. The new formula is subject to approval by the NAIC. If approved, the new formula may enable us to release capital temporarily from our long term care insurance business for use in other business lines in December 2005. Payment protection insurance. Our payment protection insurance business has expanded as a result of our strategy to enter additional markets in Continental Europe and Ireland and to develop new relationships with distributors in those markets. However, the margins of our payment protection business in the U.K. have decreased in recent years as a result of increased pricing pressure and greater competition from captive insurance arrangements by distributors that provide payment protection insurance directly to their customers. As a result, in the third quarter of 2003, we evaluated our contractual relationships with our payment protection insurance distributors against our targeted return thresholds and decided to terminate or not to renew certain relationships that we refer to as run off. In the aggregate, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, in our payment protection insurance business decreased by 31% from $2,175 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,501 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. However, excluding run off business, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, increased by 21% from $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,441 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although we expect the total revenue from our payment protection business to continue to decline over the next few years as our run off business diminishes, we believe this will not have a material impact on our operating earnings and will have a favorable effect on our returns as capital is released and redeployed into markets with potential for higher growth and returns. Annuities. The results of our Retirement Income and Investments segment are affected primarily by interest rate fluctuations and volatile equity markets, as discussed above under Overview Business trends and conditions General conditions and trends affecting our businesses. In addition, our competitive position within many of our distribution channels depends significantly upon product features, including our crediting rates on spread based products relative to our competitors, minimum guaranteed rates, surrender charge periods and agent commissions. We continually evaluate our competitive position based upon each of those features, and we make adjustments as appropriate to meet our target return thresholds. For example, our deposits in fixed annuities increased by 67% from $1,028 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 to $1,719 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of our expanded distribution relationships with financial intermediaries and a new fixed annuity product we introduced in 2004 that incorporates flexible product features. We believe that a gradual increase in market interest rates will have a favorable impact on consumer demand for these products. We also recently introduced the Income Distribution Series of guaranteed income annuity products and riders that provide the contractholder with a guaranteed minimum income stream and an opportunity to participate in market appreciation but reduce some of the risks to insurers that generally accompany traditional products with guaranteed minimum income benefits. Sales of these products increased by 82% from $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $258 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our new deposits in variable annuities decreased by 48% from $2,048 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,075 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We believe this decline was primarily driven by a market shift to variable annuity products with certain guaranteed benefit features that we chose not to offer due to their risk profile. 100 Table of Contents Mortgage insurance. As discussed above under Overview Business trends and conditions General conditions and trends affecting our businesses, increasing interest rates in 2004 have contributed to a significant decrease in U.S. new mortgage insurance written. Our U.S. new insurance written also has been adversely affected by our actions in connection with our captive reinsurance arrangements. Starting in late 2003, we generally sought to exit or restructure a portion of our excess of loss risk sharing arrangements with premium cessions in excess of 25% to improve profitability. This resulted in a significant reduction in business from several of these lenders. We later re evaluated these relationships on a case by case basis, assessing various factors, including ceding terms, attachment points and quality of portfolios. As a result, we reinstated or restructured some of these arrangements in a form that we believe allows us to achieve acceptable returns. For the foregoing reasons, as well as the continued popularity of simultaneous second, or 80 10 10, loans as an alternative to private mortgage insurance, our U.S. new insurance written decreased by 58% from $67.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $28.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the significant U.S. refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 and the significant expansion of our international business in recent years, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 80% of our U.S. risk in force and 72% of our international risk in force had not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years, which are generally between the third and seventh year of the loan. We expect our loss experience on these loans will increase as policies continue to age. Our international mortgage insurance business has continued to expand and has had a favorable impact on our results of operations. International new insurance written increased by 32% from $39.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $51.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was driven by a larger mortgage origination market in Canada and increased account penetration in both Canada and Australia, as well as growth in new insurance written in Europe and favorable foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by a smaller mortgage origination market in Australia. We expect that the growth of our international mortgage insurance business will continue to contribute an increasing portion of this segments total revenues and profits. Separation from GE and related financial arrangements GE historically has provided a variety of products and services to us, and we have provided various products and services to GE. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a transition services agreement and various other agreements with GE that, together with a number of agreements that were in effect before the IPO, govern the relationship between GE and us. Services received from GE Support services and corporate overhead. GE historically has provided a variety of support services for our businesses, including: customer service, transaction processing and a variety of functional support services provided by an outsourcing provider in India that was wholly owned by GE until December 2004 and is now 40% owned by GE; employee benefit processing and payroll administration, including relocation, travel, credit card processing and related services; employee training programs, including access to GE training courses; insurance coverage under the GE insurance program; information systems, network and related services; leases for vehicles, equipment and facilities; and other financial advisory services such as tax consulting, capital markets services, research and development activities, and use of trademarks and licenses. We have reimbursed GE for the costs of providing these services to us. We paid GE a total of $65 million, $87 million and $74 million for these services for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 101 Table of Contents In addition, GE historically has allocated to us a share of its corporate overhead expenses for certain services provided to us, which are not specifically billed to us, including public relations, investor relations, treasury, and internal audit services. Our total expense for this allocation was $14 million, $50 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We have not reimbursed these amounts to GE, and have recorded them as a capital contribution in each year. Following the completion of the IPO, GE no longer allocates any of its corporate expenses to us. GE continues to provide us with many of the corporate services described above on a transitional basis, and we are arranging to procure other services pursuant to arrangements with third parties or through our own employees. In the aggregate, we expect that our total costs for procuring corporate services that previously had been provided by GE will not materially exceed the amounts we historically have paid to GE for these services, including GEs allocation to us for its corporate overhead. However, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental advertising, marketing, investor relations and legal entity transition expenses to establish a new brand identity. We also incurred compensation expense with respect to the establishment of our new equity plans. In addition, we have obtained direct access to a variety of third party products and services, including technology licenses, as a result of GEs relationships with those third parties. We have negotiated and are continuing to negotiate our own arrangements with third party providers for these products and services, and we do not believe these arrangements will result in materially increased costs in the aggregate. Investment management services. We have received and will continue to receive investment management services from GE Asset Management Incorporated, or GEAM, a subsidiary of GE, pursuant to agreements that were, with limited exceptions, amended in connection with the IPO. We also entered into new agreements with GE Asset Management Limited, or GEAML, an affiliate of GEAM, for investment management services in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Pursuant to these agreements, the fees charged by GEAM and GEAML are based on a percentage of the value of the assets under management. This percentage is established annually by agreement between us and GEAM or GEAML and is intended to reflect the cost to GEAM or GEAML of providing its services and, for the agreements with GEAML, a premium of 5%. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our aggregate costs for investment management and related administration services provided by GEAM and GEAML were approximately $33 million, $61 million and $39 million, respectively. Reinsurance transactions. In addition to our arrangements with UFLIC, we have entered into reinsurance transactions with affiliates of GE, principally Employers Reassurance Company and ERC Life Reinsurance Corporation (formerly an affiliate of GE), which we refer to collectively as ERC, under which we have reinsured some of the risks of our insurance policies on terms comparable to those we could obtain from third parties. We have paid premiums to these affiliates of $39 million, $56 million and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, in 2002, one of our subsidiaries entered into a life reinsurance agreement with an affiliated company, GE Pensions Limited, to reinsure 95% of our liabilities under certain life insurance policies. We have paid premiums to this affiliate of $100 million and $94 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This agreement was terminated as of December 31, 2003. Employee benefit plans. Historically, we have reimbursed GE for benefits it has provided to our employees under various employee benefit plans, including GEs retirement plan, retiree health and life insurance benefit plans, defined contribution savings plan and life and health insurance benefits through the GE benefit program. We incurred expenses associated with these plans of $108 million, $109 million and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. GE will continue to provide these benefits to our employees for so long as GE owns more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. See note 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition to these expenses for which we have reimbursed GE, we have incurred expenses of $2 million, $9 million and $6 million for certain GE stock option and restricted stock unit grants for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As in the case of the allocation of corporate overhead, we have not reimbursed these amounts with respect to stock options and restricted stock units to GE. In connection with the IPO, we established our own equity compensation plans. See Equity plans below. 102 Table of Contents Services provided to GE We have provided various products and services to GE on terms comparable to those we provide to third parties and we expect to continue to provide many of these products and services to GE. In addition, in connection with the IPO, we entered into a series of arrangements with GE pursuant to which we will provide a variety of additional services to GE, including the arrangements discussed below. The following describes the principal impact of those service arrangements on our results of operations: Transition services relating to GE and GEFAHI businesses not acquired by us. We provide services to certain of GEs insurance businesses that we did not acquire. These services include finance, information systems, network services and regulatory support. We continue to provide these services and will do so for a minimum of two years and a maximum of three years, in most cases, following the IPO. For the two years following the completion of the IPO, GE generally may not terminate any of the services we provide. GE has agreed to pay us $40 million in equal quarterly installments during each of the first two years following the completion of the IPO for our provision of the transition services to GE. The charges for the transition services generally are intended to allow the providing company to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services, plus all out of pocket costs and expenses, generally without profit. Management consulting services. We have agreed to provide certain management consulting services to GE for a period of five years following the IPO. These services include delivering training, providing consultation and strategic advice with respect to actuarial, regulatory and other emerging issues, planning and participating in meetings with rating agencies and regulators, participating in government relations activities and various other activities. In consideration for these services, GE will pay us a fee of $1 million per month during the first four years following the completion of the IPO and $0.5 million per month during the fifth year. GE cannot terminate this arrangement before the expiration of the five year term. GIC investment administration services. We entered into three agreements with affiliates of GE, effective as of January 1, 2004, to manage a pool of municipal guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, issued by those affiliates. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to originate GIC liabilities and advise the GE affiliates regarding the investment, administration and management of their assets that support those liabilities. Under two of those agreements, we receive an administration fee of 0.165% per annum of the maximum program size for those GE affiliates, which is $15 billion. The agreements also provide for termination fees in the event of early termination at the option of either affiliate. Under a third agreement with another affiliate, we receive a management fee of 0.10% per annum of the book value of the investment contracts or similar securities issued by this affiliate after January 1, 2003, which was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2004. The fee we receive on the contracts issued by that affiliate before January 1, 2003 is based upon a pricing arrangement that varies depending upon the maturities of those contracts and that affiliates cost of capital. The book value of the contracts issued before January 1, 2003 was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 and is expected to generate a weighted average fee of approximately 0.35% in 2005. We also will receive reimbursement of our operating expenses under each of the agreements. The initial term of each of the three agreements will expire December 31, 2006, and unless terminated at the option of either party, each agreement automatically will renew on January 1 of each year for successive terms of one year. Institutional asset management services. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we offered a broad range of institutional asset management services to third parties. GEAM provided the portfolio management services for this business, and we provided marketing, sales and support services. We did not acquire the institutional asset management services business from GEFAHI, but we continue to provide services to GEAM and GEFAHI related to this asset management business, including client introduction services, asset retention services and compliance support. GEFAHI has agreed to pay us a fee of up to $10 million per year for four years following the completion of the IPO to provide these services. The fee will be determined based upon the level of third party assets under management managed by GEAM over the four year term. The agreement may not be terminated by GEAM or GEFAHI, except for non performance or in the event that we commence a similar institutional asset management business. 103 Table of Contents Additional arrangements with GE In addition to the arrangements described above pursuant to which we and GE will provide services to each other, we also entered into the following additional arrangements with GE: Tax Matters Agreement. As a consequence of our separation from GE, and our election jointly made with GE to treat that separation as an asset sale under section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to become entitled to additional tax deductions for periods after our corporate reorganization. We expect to realize tax savings from these deductions and have recorded our estimate of these tax savings on our statement of financial position as a $718 million reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities. We are obligated, pursuant to our Tax Matters Agreement with GE, to pay to GE, on an after tax basis, 80% of the amount of tax we are projected to save for each tax period as a result of these increased tax benefits, up to a maximum of $640 million. We have recorded the $389 million present value of this obligation to GE as our estimate of this liability in our statement of financial position. Since our initial estimates recorded at the time of the IPO, our estimate of the expected tax savings has increased significantly, while the present value of our obligation to GE has increased slightly. This is because (1) a portion of the future savings now exceeds the $640 million maximum payment to GE, (2) the discount rate increased from that estimated at the time of the IPO, and (3) the average life of the obligation increased. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we would also be required to pay to GE additional amounts in the event we realize certain other contingent benefits, or if we choose to defer certain payments and thereby incur interest on any such deferrals. To the extent that we never realize the anticipated tax savings because we have insufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (or because of a reduction in tax rates), we may, at our option, defer payments until 2029. These deferred payments would bear interest over the term of the deferral at an interest rate of 5.72% per annum (estimated, in accordance with the Tax Matters Agreement, to be our cost of funds as of the date of our initial public offering for a borrowing of like duration) from the time that we were scheduled to make the payments. In certain circumstances, we may realize tax savings later than projected in calculating the schedule of corresponding payments to GE pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, but our payment schedule to GE would not be changed. In these circumstances, we will remain obligated to pay amounts to GE even before we realize the corresponding tax savings, although we can choose to defer such payments. There are two categories of such circumstances. First, in certain limited instances the Tax Matters Agreement establishes binding factual assumptions pursuant to which we are scheduled to make payments to GE in advance of the time we anticipate realizing the corresponding tax savings. We estimate that the interest expense we will incur with respect to such advance payments over the entire life of the Tax Matters Agreement, if we choose to defer them, will be approximately $25 million. The second, broader category of these circumstances are those situations in which our actual tax savings are delayed beyond the time we currently project for any reason other than a change in the tax returns on which the section 338 sales are reported. In the case of either the first or second category, we may defer the scheduled payments to GE until we actually realize the corresponding tax savings or, alternatively, we may make the payments from sources other than the projected tax savings. Any deferred payments would bear interest until made at the rate of 5.72% per annum. The $329 million difference between the $718 million benefit we have recorded as the expected future tax savings and the $389 million liability to GE we have recorded is part of our net stockholders interest. These amounts reflect considered judgments and assessments as to the underlying facts and assumptions. However, if and to the extent our final section 338 tax savings exceed (or fall short of) the amount of tax savings we currently project, our additional paid in capital would increase (or decrease) accordingly. As our obligation to make payments under the Tax Matters Agreement accretes over time, we will record interest expense at a rate of 5.72% per annum. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, GE also is responsible for certain taxes of our legal entities, other than taxes in respect of the section 338 elections described above, resulting from the various transactions implemented in connection with our 104 Table of Contents separation from GE (other than the reinsurance with UFLIC). We record (or will record) these non recurring taxes as a current tax expense (or benefit) when incurred, and we record (or will record) GEs payment of the taxes (or receipt of the benefit) as an equity contribution (or dividend). UFLIC reinsurance arrangements. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, an indirect subsidiary of GE. Under the terms of the agreements governing these reinsurance transactions, we transferred to UFLIC assets equal to the policyholder liabilities related to the ceded blocks of business and recorded a reinsurance recoverable asset for the amount of the policyholder liabilities reinsured, except with respect to the in force liabilities for the variable annuity separate accounts, for which there is no asset transfer. We will continue to have a separate account liability in the amount of the policyholder liabilities related to the separate account assets which we did not transfer to UFLIC. We remain liable under these contracts and policies as the ceding insurer and, as a result, will continue to carry insurance reserve liabilities for the reinsured policies on our balance sheet. In connection with the Medicare supplement insurance assumed by us, UFLIC transferred to us cash and other investments, and we recorded a reinsurance liability, equal to the policyholder liabilities related to this assumed block of business. As of December 31, 2004, our total reinsurance recoverable for all our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC was $16.2 billion. The reinsurance transactions have the effect of transferring the financial results of the reinsured blocks of business (except for Medicare supplement insurance) from us to UFLIC and the Medicare supplement insurance block of business from UFLIC to us. With respect to the long term care insurance policies reinsured to UFLIC, we retained an interest in the future profitability of the block if it exceeds certain thresholds. We also are continuing to administer all the policies reinsured by UFLIC, and we will receive an expense allowance to reimburse us for the costs we incur to service these policies. Equity plans Prior to the IPO, our key employees participated in a number of GEs equity compensation plans. For grants issued prior to January 1, 2002, we recorded compensation expense related to our employees participation in those plans over the vesting period of the awards based upon their intrinsic value at the grant date. For grants issued after January 1, 2002, we recorded compensation expense for share based compensation awards over the vesting period of the awards based upon their fair value at the grant date in accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In connection with the IPO, we established our own equity compensation plans. Under these plans, unvested GE stock options, vested stock options held by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, GE stock appreciation rights and GE restricted stock units were canceled and converted into awards of our company, and we also granted new stock options in our company in connection with our separation from GE and the IPO. The GE stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units were converted based upon a ratio equal to the initial offering price of our common stock in the IPO ($19.50), divided by the weighted average stock price of GE common stock for the trading day immediately preceding the pricing date of the IPO ($30.52). The converted securities, if unvested, generally continue to vest over their original vesting periods. The unvested converted awards had approximately the same fair value at the date of the conversion as the GE awards that were replaced. We incurred compensation expense of $29 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and expect to incur expenses of $41 million and $31 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, for 2004 and prior awards to our employees under these plans. Branding costs We expect to incur aggregate expenses of approximately $35 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 on marketing, advertising and legal entity transition expenses, relating to the costs of establishing our new brand throughout our business, including with sales intermediaries, employees, investors and consumers. 105 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be particularly critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and our managements best estimates may require adjustment. Reserves. We calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders and contractholders based on actuarial assumptions and in accordance with industry practice and U.S. GAAP. Many factors can affect these reserves, including economic and social conditions, inflation, healthcare costs, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Therefore, the reserves we establish are necessarily based on estimates, assumptions and our analysis of historical experience. Our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products. Our reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. Insurance reserves differ for long and short duration insurance policies and annuity contracts. Measurement of long duration insurance reserves (such as guaranteed renewable term life, whole life and long term care insurance policies) is based on approved actuarial methods, but necessarily includes assumptions about expenses, mortality, morbidity, lapse rates and future yield on related investments. Short duration contracts (such as payment protection insurance) are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that periods claims, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. Short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events. Estimates of mortgage insurance reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on notices of mortgage loan defaults and estimates of defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, using assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim. As is common accounting practice in the mortgage insurance industry and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, loss reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default. Deferred acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs, or DAC, represents costs which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts that are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. DAC is subsequently amortized to expense, over the lives of the underlying contracts, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits. The amortization of DAC for traditional long duration insurance products (including guaranteed renewable term life, life contingent structured settlements and immediate annuities and long term care insurance) is determined as a level proportion of premium based on commonly accepted actuarial methods and reasonable assumptions established when the contract or policy is issued about mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, expenses, and future yield on related investments. Amortization for annuity contracts without significant mortality risk and investment and universal life products is based on estimated gross profits and is adjusted as those estimates are revised. The DAC amortization methodology for our variable products (variable annuities and variable universal life insurance) includes a long term equity market average appreciation assumption of 8.5%. When actual returns vary from the expected 8.5%, we assume a reversion to this mean over a 3 to 7 year period, subject to the imposition of ceilings and floors. The assumed returns over this reversion period are limited to the 85th percentile of historical market performance. We regularly review all of these assumptions and periodically test DAC for recoverability. For deposit products, if the current present value of estimated future gross profits is less than the unamortized DAC for a line 106 Table of Contents of business, a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization. For other products, if the benefit reserves plus anticipated future premiums and interest earnings for a line of business are less than the current estimate of future benefits and expenses (including any unamortized DAC), a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization or for increased benefit reserves. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves. In recent years, the portion of estimated product margins required to amortize DAC and PVFP has increased in most lines of our business, with the most significant impact on investment products, primarily as the result of lower investment returns. Present value of future profits. In conjunction with the acquisition of a block of life insurance policies or investment contracts, a portion of the purchase price is assigned to the right to receive future gross profits arising from existing insurance and investment contracts. This intangible asset, called the present value of future profits, or PVFP, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. PVFP is amortized, net of accreted interest, in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC. We regularly review our assumptions and periodically test PVFP for recoverability in a manner similar to our treatment of DAC. Goodwill impairment. Goodwill resulting from acquisitions is tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge to income would be recorded. Valuation of investment securities. We obtain values for actively traded securities from external pricing services. For infrequently traded securities, we obtain quotes from brokers or we estimate values using internally developed pricing models. These models are based upon common valuation techniques and require us to make assumptions regarding credit quality, liquidity and other factors that affect estimated values. Impairment of investment securities. We regularly review investment securities for impairment in accordance with our impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security position is in an unrealized loss position, and for fixed maturities, whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent to hold the security until recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams, as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of GEAM and other third party managers, as required. We actively perform comprehensive market research, monitor market conditions and segment our investments by credit risk in order to minimize impairment risks. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Impairments of investment securities and note 6 to our financial statements. Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations The following table sets forth our historical and pro forma results of operations. The pro forma financial information reflects our historical results of operations as adjusted to reflect the various adjustments described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information. The pro forma financial information principally reflects the exclusion from our results of operations of the structured settlement, variable annuity and long term care insurance in force blocks that we ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions; the exclusion from our results of operations of certain businesses, including the Affinity segment, and other assets and liabilities of GEFAHI that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization; the inclusion in our results of operations of incremental interest expense associated with the consideration that we issued to GEFAHI in connection with our corporate reorganization, including $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock and the $550 million Contingent Note; and the issuance of $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. 107 Table of Contents Our historical results of operations include the results of operations of the Affinity segment and the blocks of business that we ceded to UFLIC through for all periods presented through May 24, 2004, the date of our corporate reorganization. Pro forma revenues and benefits and expenses (except interest expense) are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured blocks of business and the to the Affinity segment. Pro forma interest expense is higher than historical interest expense as the result of our revised capital structure following our corporate reorganization and the IPO. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 6,559 $ 6,707 $ 6,107 $ 6,388 Net investment income 3,648 4,051 3,979 3,160 Net realized investment gains 26 10 204 23 Policy fees and other income 824 915 939 664 Total revenues 11,057 11,683 11,229 10,235 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 4,804 5,270 4,640 4,340 Interest credited 1,432 1,624 1,645 1,319 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,812 1,916 1,808 1,657 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 1,154 1,351 1,221 1,052 Interest expense 217 140 124 243 Total benefits and expenses 9,419 10,301 9,438 8,611 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting change 1,638 1,382 1,791 1,624 Provision for income taxes 493 413 411 494 Net earnings from continuing operations before accounting change $ 1,145 $ 969 $ 1,380 $ 1,130 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Our premiums consist primarily of premiums earned on individual life, long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies, income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies and mortgage insurance policies. Premiums decreased $148 million, or 2%, to $6,559 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as the result of a $156 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $107 million decrease in our Protection segment, partially offset by an $84 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment and a $45 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investment segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in long term care insurance premiums as the result of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, as well as a decrease in payment protection insurance premiums as the result of the continued run off of low return books of business. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in international mortgage insurance premiums, attributable to the aging of our international in force block, which resulted in increased earned premiums from prior year new insurance written, offset in part by a decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums, attributable to decreased demand for mortgage insurance as the result of a smaller U.S. market for mortgage originations. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums from life 108 Table of Contents contingent income annuities attributable to new distribution relationships in 2004, offset in part by a decrease in premiums from life contingent structured settlements attributable to our decision to write those contracts only when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Net investment income. Net investment income represents the income earned on our investments. Net investment income decreased $403 million, or 10%, to $3,648 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $4,051 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease in net investment income was primarily the result of a decrease in average invested assets, primarily due to the transfer of assets to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions, partially offset by new asset purchases. The decrease in net investment income was also the result of a decrease in weighted average investment yields to 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in weighted average investment yields was primarily attributable to purchases of new assets in an interest rate environment where current market yields are lower than existing portfolio yields. Net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains consist of gross realized investment gains and gross realized investment (losses), including charges related to impairments. Net realized investment gains increased $16 million to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross realized gains and (losses) were $90 million and $(64) million, respectively. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $26 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($17 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the timber products, healthcare, consumer products industries ($6 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively). The equity securities impairments primarily related to mutual fund investments. The other investments impairments related to impairment of limited partnership investments. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross realized gains and (losses) were $473 million and $(463) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $43 million gain from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $224 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($126 million, $83 million and $15 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the transportation, mining and metals, utilities and energy and technology and communications industries ($36 million, $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively). In addition, $30 million of fixed maturities impairments were realized on asset backed securities. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($37 million and $46 million, respectively). The other investments impairments primarily related to impairment of limited partnership investments Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income consist primarily of cost of insurance and surrender charges assessed on universal life insurance policies, fees assessed against policyholder and contractholder account values, and commission income. Policy fees and other income decreased $91 million, or 10%, to $824 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of a $156 million decrease in our Affinity segment and a $12 million decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decreases were partially offset by a $46 million increase in our Corporate and Other segment, and a $28 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily the result of a decrease in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to lower refinancing activity in the U.S. The increase in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to a gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in commission income due to increased sales of third party products and fee income earned in connection with investment and administrative services related to a pool of municipal GICs issued by affiliates of GE, offset by a decrease in fee income attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. 109 Table of Contents Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves consist primarily of reserve activity related to current claims and future policy benefits on life, long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies, structured settlements and income annuities with life contingencies and claim costs incurred related to mortgage insurance products. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $466 million, or 9%, to $4,804 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $5,270 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $253 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, a $116 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $107 million decrease in our Protection segment and a $40 million decrease in our Corporate and Other segment, offset partially by a $50 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to a decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC and a reclassification of variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders, which were classified as underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, in 2003. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily related to a decrease in our payment protection insurance business attributable to the lower loss ratio in the payment protection insurance run off block. The decrease in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to lower litigation expenses and higher reserves at our Bermuda reinsurer. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in paid claims as well as an increase in loans in default associated with higher insurance in force in our international mortgage insurance business. Interest credited. Interest credited represents interest credited on behalf of policyholder and contractholder general account balances. Interest credited decreased $192 million, or 12%, to $1,432 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $189 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment that was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest credited associated with the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease in interest credited was also the result of lower interest credited on institutional products due to a decrease in the average size of the in force block. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, represent costs and expenses related to the acquisition and ongoing maintenance of insurance and investment contracts, including commissions, policy issue expenses and other underwriting and general operating costs. These costs and expenses are net of amounts that are capitalized and deferred, which are primarily costs and expenses which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts, such as first year commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and other policy issue expenses. These expenses decreased $104 million, or 5%, to $1,812 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $1,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as the result of a $121 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $37 million decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment and a $32 million decrease in our Corporate and Other Segment, partially offset by a $75 million increase in our Protection segment and a $11 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses primarily from lower underwriting expenses due to a decline in refinancing activity in the U.S., lower administrative costs and a decrease in the provision for indemnity liabilities related to a decline in mortgage loan origination. The decrease in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in allocated expenses from GE as the result of our corporate reorganization and lower litigation expenses. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to an increase in our payment protection insurance business related primarily to an increase in commissions and other compensation arrangements in our run off block, partially offset by decreased legal fees in our life insurance business following an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit in 2003 and lower other expenses and a decrease in the long term care business primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in commission and other expenses incurred in our fee based products primarily due to increased sales. 110 Table of Contents Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of acquisition costs that are capitalized and PVFP. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $197 million, or 15%, to $1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $132 million decrease in our Protection segment, a $58 million decrease in our Affinity segment, and a $20 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, partially offset by a $14 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in payment protection insurance due to our decision not to renew certain distribution relationships, partially offset by the impact of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The increase in the Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization reflecting higher than expected early year margins on recently written policies in the U.S. and the continued growth of our international business. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $77 million, or 55%, to $217 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization, as well as the full year contribution of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and interest paid on non recourse funding obligations issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $80 million, or 19%, to $493 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $413 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate increased to 30.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE, a decrease in benefits related to dividends received, and favorable examination developments in 2003, which did not recur in 2004, offset in part by tax benefits recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization. Net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $176 million, or 18%, to $1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects increases in segment net earnings in each of our segments, except for our Affinity segment, whose net earnings decreased as a result of its exclusion as a result of our corporate reorganization. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $600 million, or 10%, to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6,107 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $500 million increase in our Protection segment, a $58 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, and a $39 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to increases in payment protection insurance premiums as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates and growth of the in force block as well as growth in long term care insurance premiums. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in life contingent structured settlement premiums, offset in part by a decrease in life contingent income annuities. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in international mortgage insurance premiums, offset in part by a decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $72 million, or 2%, to $4,051 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $3,979 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in net investment income was primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in weighted average investment yields, primarily attributable to investments in the U.S., to 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002. 111 Table of Contents Net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains decreased $194 million to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross realized gains and (losses) were $473 million and $(463) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $43 million gain from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $224 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($126 million, $83 million and $15 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the transportation, mining and metals, utilities and energy and technology and communications industries ($36 million, $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively). In addition, $30 million of fixed maturities impairments were realized on asset backed securities. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($37 million and $46 million, respectively). The other investments impairments primarily related to impairment of limited partnership investments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross realized gains and (losses) were $790 million and $(586) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2002 included $29 million from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2002 included $343 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($193 million, $133 million and $17 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the technology and communications and airline industries ($131 million and $27 million, respectively). The technology and communication industry impairments include $83 million related to securities issued by WorldCom Inc. and its affiliates. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($81 million and $52 million, respectively). The other investments impairments are related to impairment of limited partnership and other private equity investments. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $24 million to $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $939 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $25 million decrease in our Protection segment and an $11 million decrease in our Affinity segment, partially offset by a $10 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business. The decrease in our Affinity segment was primarily attributable to the decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to higher contract underwriting fees related to increased refinancing activity in the U.S. and higher fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $630 million, or 14%, to $5,270 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $4,640 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $367 million increase in our Protection segment, a $117 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment and a $69 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to an increase in changes in policy reserves for long term care insurance, payment protection insurance and life insurance. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in changes in policy reserves for structured settlements. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to favorable loss development on prior year reserves. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $21 million, or 1%, to $1,624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,645 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $24 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment that was primarily attributable to lower credited rates on GICs and funding agreements, offset in part by an increase in interest credited resulting from more variable annuity policyholders selecting the fixed account option on their contracts, on which we credit interest. The decrease in interest credited was also the result of a reduction in our weighted average crediting rates to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. 112 Table of Contents Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, increased $108 million, or 6%, to $1,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,808 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $89 million increase in our Protection segment, a $66 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment, partially offset by a $68 million decrease in our Affinity segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to higher expenses associated with increased refinancing activity in the U.S., continued investment in our international mortgage insurance business and higher indemnity liabilities for U.S. contract underwriting claims, which are included as other liabilities in our statement of financial position. U.S contract underwriting indemnification claims arise out of our contract underwriting agreements, pursuant to which we agree to indemnify lenders against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors during the underwriting process. These claims are classified in this line item (and not in Benefits and other changes in policy reserves) because they do not relate to insured events. Our indemnification liabilities related to U.S. contract underwriting claims increased as the result of our updating the assumptions we used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans underwritten due to significant refinancing activity. The decrease in our Affinity segment was primarily attributable to cost saving initiatives that reduced compensation and benefits and other general expenses. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization increased $130 million, or 11%, to $1,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,221 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $155 million increase in our Protection segment, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to the impact of additional amortization in 2002 due to lower equity valuations of assets in our variable annuity separate accounts. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $16 million, or 13%, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $27 million of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003, and $3 million of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, supporting certain term life insurance policies. These increases were partially offset by a $14 million decrease in interest expense that was primarily the result of lower average short term borrowings and long term borrowings. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $2 million to $413 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a $152 million decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 that was attributable to a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to the treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders on life insurance contracts, partially offset by dividend received deduction benefits realized in 2003. Excluding the effect of the settlement, our effective tax rate would have been 29.9% and 31.4% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased by $411 million, or 30%, to $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,380 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in net realized investment gains and the impact of a favorable settlement with the IRS in 2002. The decline in net earnings from continuing operations reflects decreases in segment net earnings in our Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, Mortgage Insurance and Corporate and Other segments, partially offset by increased segment net earnings in our Affinity segment. 113 Table of Contents Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations by Segment Set forth below is historical financial information for each of our operating segments (Protection, Retirement Income and Investments and Mortgage Insurance), together with our Corporate and Other segment and the Affinity segment. Set forth below also is pro forma financial information for our Protection, Retirement Income and Investments and Corporate and Other segments. There were no pro forma adjustments to the results of operations of our Mortgage Insurance segment, and pro forma financial information is not provided for the Affinity segment because we did not acquire that segment from GEFAHI. All pro forma segment information is prepared on the same basis as the segment information presented in our unaudited financial statements. Management regularly reviews the performance of each of our operating segments based on the after tax net earnings (loss) of the segment, which excludes: (1) net realized investment gains (losses), (2) most of our interest and other financing expenses, (3) amounts reserved for the settlement in principle of the class action litigation relating to sales practices in our life insurance business, and (4) advertising and marketing costs and severance and restructuring charges. Although these excluded items are significant to our consolidated financial performance, we believe that the presentation of segment net earnings (loss) enhances our understanding and assessment of the results of operations of our operating segments by highlighting net earnings (loss) attributable to the normal, recurring operations of our business. However, segment net earnings (loss) is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Historical Pro forma As of or for the yearsended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues by segment: Protection $ 6,064 $ 6,143 $ 5,605 $ 5,935 Retirement Income and Investments 3,361 3,803 3,756 2,891 Mortgage Insurance 1,090 982 946 1,090 Affinity 218 566 588 Corporate and Other 324 189 334 319 Total revenues $ 11,057 $ 11,683 $ 11,229 $ 10,235 Segment net earnings (loss) from continuing operations: Protection $ 528 $ 487 $ 554 $ 527 Retirement Income and Investments 153 151 186 148 Mortgage Insurance 426 369 451 426 Affinity (14 ) 16 (3 ) Corporate and Other 52 (54 ) 192 29 Total segment net earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ 1,145 $ 969 $ 1,380 $ 1,130 Total assets by segment (as of the period ended): Protection $ 31,806 $ 29,254 Retirement Income and Investments 56,610 55,614 Mortgage Insurance 6,428 6,110 Affinity 2,315 Corporate and Other 9,034 10,138 Total assets $ 103,878 $ 103,431 114 Table of Contents Protection segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Protection segment. Prior to our corporate reorganization, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions in which we ceded to UFLIC a block of long term care insurance policies that we reinsured from Travelers in 2000, and we assumed from UFLIC in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance policies. We ceded the Travelers long term care block to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore its results are not included in our historical results after that date. Similarly, we assumed the Medicare supplement blocks from UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore their results are included in our historical results after that date. As a result of the foregoing, our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The pro forma earnings information below reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions as if they had been effective as of January 1, 2004. There were no pro forma adjustments to interest credited or interest expense because the long term care insurance policies we ceded to UFLIC, and the Medicare supplement insurance policies UFLIC ceded to us, in connection with the reinsurance transactions do not generate such fees, interest credited or interest expense. Pro forma revenues and benefits and expenses are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured block of long term care insurance. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 4,481 $ 4,588 $ 4,088 $ 4,398 Net investment income 1,224 1,199 1,136 1,178 Policy fees and other income 359 356 381 359 Total revenues 6,064 6,143 5,605 5,935 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 2,890 2,997 2,630 2,788 Interest credited 362 365 362 362 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,094 1,019 930 1,077 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 869 1,001 846 861 Interest expense 15 3 15 Total benefits and expenses 5,230 5,385 4,768 5,103 Earnings before income taxes 834 758 837 832 Provision for income taxes 306 271 283 305 Segment net earnings $ 528 $ 487 $ 554 $ 527 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums decreased $107 million, or 2%, to $4,481 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $4,588 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $102 million decrease in long term care insurance premiums, consisting of a $124 million decrease attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by a $22 million increase in premiums associated with the growth of the in force block. The decrease was also the result of a $81 million decrease in payment protection insurance premiums, consisting of a $231 million decrease on a constant currency basis, net of a $150 million increase attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The $231 million decrease consisted of a $393 million decrease in premiums in our run off block, offset by a $162 million increase in our continuing business 115 Table of Contents due to new distribution relationships and the growth of consumer lending in Continental Europe. These decreases were offset in part by a $61 million increase in life insurance premiums that was primarily attributable to growth of the term life insurance in force block. The decreases were also offset in part by a $15 million increase in group life and health insurance premiums attributable to growth of the in force block that was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of non medical products as the result of enhancements in our life insurance and disability product offerings and the expansion of our dental network. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $25 million, or 2%, to $1,224 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,199 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase, which included $13 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets, offset in part by declining yields on investments and by a decrease in invested capital allocated to this segment in preparation for our corporate reorganization and initial public offering. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $3 million, or 1%, to $359 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $13 million increase in our life insurance business primarily attributable to an increase in policy fees and other income in our universal life insurance business. This increase was partially offset by a $9 million decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher lapse rates in 2004. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $107 million, or 4%, to $2,890 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $2,997 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $113 million decrease in our payment protection insurance business attributable to the lower loss ratio in the payment protection insurance run off block, $27 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was also attributable to a $85 million decrease in long term care benefits and other changes in policy reserves, consisting of a $150 million decrease primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by a $65 million increase primarily attributable to increased reserves and benefit payments resulting from the normal, expected increases in claims volume associated with the aging and continued growth of the long term care in force block. The decrease was partially offset by a $71 million increase in our life insurance business attributable to growth of the in force block and less favorable claim experience compared to 2003, as well as a $19 million increase in our group life and health insurance business primarily attributable to growth in the in force block and loss ratios that were more in line with expectations after favorable results in 2003. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $3 million, or 1%, to $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased crediting rates for universal life insurance policies, offset in part by increased policyholder account balances on corporate owned life insurance policies. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals increased $75 million, or 7%, to $1,094 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to an $116 million increase in our payment protection insurance business related primarily to an increase in commissions and other compensation arrangements in our run off block. This increase was partially offset by a $27 million decrease in our life insurance business primarily attributable to decreased legal fees following the agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit in 2003 and lower other expenses. The increase was also partially offset by an $18 million decrease in our long term care insurance business primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $132 million, or 13%, to $869 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $184 million decrease 116 Table of Contents in payment protection insurance due to our decision not to renew certain distribution relationships, partially offset by an increase of $69 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was also partially attributable to a $20 million decrease in our life insurance business due to lower 2004 lapses in our term life insurance block and lower amortization on our universal life insurance block due to additional investment income related to bond calls and favorable universal life insurance claims experience, both of which resulted in accelerated amortization in 2003 and did not recur in 2004. Long term care amortization decreased $3 million primarily as a result of a $14 million decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by an increase in our long term care business due to growth in the in force block. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $12 million to $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004, supporting certain term life insurance policies. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $35 million, or 13%, to $306 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 36.7% and 35.8% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased by $41 million, or 8%, to $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net earnings primarily reflects increases in net earnings in our life, payment protection and long term care insurance businesses, offset in part by a decrease in net earnings in our group life and health insurance business. The increase in life insurance was primarily attributable to growth of the in force block and lower legal expenses following the agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit. The increase in payment protection insurance was primarily attributable to $10 million in one time charges related to employee benefit costs, as well as an $8 million increase due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase due to growth in our continuing business, partially offset by the loss of certain foreign tax benefits. The increase in our long term care insurance business was primarily attributable to the growth of the block, partially offset by a loss of earnings on invested capital attributable to a reallocation of capital to our Corporate and Other segment and decreased earnings as a result of the reinsurance transactions. The decrease in our group life and health insurance business was attributable to loss experience that was more in line with expectations after favorable results in 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $500 million, or 12%, to $4,588 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $4,088 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $265 million increase in payment protection insurance premiums, with $155 million of that increase attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and $110 million of that increase attributable to growth of the in force block. The increase was also the result of a $232 million increase in long term care insurance premiums that was primarily attributable to growth of the in force block. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $63 million, or 6%, to $1,199 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,136 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in invested assets, offset in part by declining yields on investments in the lower interest rate environment. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $25 million, or 7%, to $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $13 million decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher lapse rates. 117 Table of Contents Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $367 million, or 14%, to $2,997 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,630 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $267 million increase in changes in reserves and benefit payments resulting from the normal, expected increases in claims volume associated with the aging of the long term care insurance in force block. The increase was also the result of a $69 million increase in changes in policy reserves attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block, of which $34 million was attributable to a lower amount of favorable loss development on prior year reserves, and a $38 million increase in life insurance reserves. Interest credited. Interest credited increased $3 million, or 1%, to $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of increased policyholder account balances on corporate owned life insurance policies, offset in part by decreased crediting rates for universal life insurance policies. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals increased $89 million, or 10%, to $1,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $930 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an $83 million increase attributable to growth in the payment protection insurance in force block that was primarily associated with an increase in net commission expense. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $155 million, or 18%, to $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $846 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $96 million increase resulting from growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The increase was also the result of a $33 million increase primarily attributable to additional investment income due to early bond calls within the universal life insurance investment portfolio and to favorable universal life insurance claims experience, both of which accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. In addition, $19 million of the increase was the result of the impact of the amortization of PVFP in 2002 for the block of long term care insurance reinsured from Travelers. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, supporting certain term life insurance policies. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $12 million, or 4%, to $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $283 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a decrease in certain foreign tax loss and dividend benefits. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased by $67 million, or 12%, to $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $554 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in segment net earnings primarily reflects decreases in net earnings for life, payment protection and group life and health insurance products, offset in part by increases in net earnings for long term care insurance products. The decrease in life insurance was primarily attributable to an increase in life insurance reserves, as well as accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles related to additional investment income resulting from early bond calls and favorable claims experience. The decrease in payment protection insurance was primarily attributable to higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, and the impact of the recognition in 2002 of certain foreign tax loss benefits. The decrease in group life and health insurance was primarily attributable to lower administration fees due to higher lapse rates. The increase in long term care insurance was primarily attributable to growth in the in force blocks. 118 Table of Contents Retirement Income and Investments segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Retirement Income and Investments segment. Prior to our corporate reorganization, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions in which we ceded to UFLIC all of our in force structured settlements contracts and substantially all of our in force variable annuity contracts. We ceded these blocks of business to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore their results are not included in our historical results after that date. As a result of the foregoing, our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The pro forma earnings information below reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions as if they had been effective as of January 1, 2004. Pro forma revenues (except premiums) and benefits and expenses are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured block of long term care insurance. There were no pro forma adjustments to premiums because the structured settlements we ceded are single premium products and do not have renewal premiums, and the variable annuity products we ceded are deposit contracts and their deposits are not recorded as premiums. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 1,094 $ 1,049 $ 991 $ 1,094 Net investment income 1,996 2,511 2,522 1,582 Policy fees and other income 271 243 243 215 Total revenues 3,361 3,803 3,756 2,891 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 1,633 1,886 1,769 1,352 Interest credited 1,070 1,259 1,283 957 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 250 239 221 229 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 170 190 210 122 Interest expense 1 1 Total benefits and expenses 3,124 3,574 3,483 2,661 Earnings before income taxes 237 229 273 230 Provision for income taxes 84 78 87 82 Segment net earnings $ 153 $ 151 $ 186 $ 148 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums increased $45 million, or 4%, to $1,094 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $68 million increase in premiums for life contingent income annuities that was primarily attributable to new distribution relationships in 2004. The increase was partially offset by a $23 million decrease in premiums for life contingent structured settlements that was primarily attributable to our decision to write those contracts only when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $515 million, or 21%, to $1,996 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of a decrease in average invested assets, primarily associated with assets transferred to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions, partially offset by new asset purchases. The decrease in net investment income also was the result of declining yields on investments. 119 Table of Contents Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $28 million, or 12%, to $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily attributable to a $38 million increase in commission income due to increased sales of third party products. The increase was also attributable to $34 million of fee income earned pursuant to new arrangements we entered into, effective as of January 1, 2004, to provide investment and administrative services related to a pool of municipal GICs issued by affiliates of GE. The increase was also attributable to a $10 million increase in fee income attributable to increased assets under management and a $10 million increase in asset management service fees. These increases were partially offset by a $62 million decrease in fee income primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $253 million, or 13%, to $1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $341 million decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease was also partially attributable to a $34 million reclassification in variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders, which were classified as underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, in 2003. This reclassification was the result of the adoption of SOP 03 1 on January 1, 2004. The decrease was partially offset by a $68 million increase in reserves relating to life contingent income annuities and a $17 million increase related to favorable mortality on income annuities in 2003 which did not recur in 2004. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a one time charge of $49 million, $41 million of which was recorded in benefits and other changes in policy reserves. This charge related to a small run off block of equity indexed annuities and resulted from an adjustment of reserving processes. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $189 million, or 15%, to $1,070 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,259 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $172 million decrease in interest credited as the result of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. This decrease was also the result of a $16 million decrease relating to lower interest credited on institutional products due to a decrease in the average size of the in force block, as well as lower average interest crediting rates. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, increased by $11 million, or 5%, to $250 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $32 million in commission and other expenses incurred in our fee based products primarily due to increased sales. The increase was also the result of the reclassification of $33 million of variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders which were classified as deferred acquisition costs in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a $45 million decrease in expenses associated with blocks of business ceded as part of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC and an $7 million decrease in guarantee fund assessments. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $20 million, or 11%, to $170 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $33 million decrease attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease was partially offset by $8 million of accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs associated with variable life insurance. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $6 million, or 8%, to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate increased to 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of the impact of higher dividends received deduction benefits related to separate account annuity products in 2003. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased $2 million, or 1%, to $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result 120 Table of Contents of lower expenses due primarily to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, offset by declining yields on invested assets. The increase in segment net earnings also was attributable to an increase in fees received under new contracts with GE to manage its municipal GIC business, as well as growth in our asset management businesses, growth in assets under management overall, and improved spreads, offset by a one time charge of $32 million (post tax) related to an adjustment of reserving processes related to a small run off block of equity indexed annuities. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $58 million, or 6%, to $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $991 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $92 million increase in premiums for life contingent structured settlements that was attributable to higher sales of this product. This increase was offset in part by a $31 million decrease in premiums for life contingent income annuities that was primarily attributable to lower sales of this product resulting from a reduction of crediting and payout rates in 2003 in the lower interest rate environment. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $11 million to $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of declining yields on investments, which was offset in part by an increase in invested assets. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income were unchanged at $243 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $117 million, or 7%, to $1,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,769 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $107 million increase in changes in policy reserves for structured settlements attributable to higher sales of this product. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $24 million, or 2%, to $1,259 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,283 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower credited rates on GICs and funding agreements attributable to the lower interest rate environment, offset in part by an increase in interest credited attributable to more variable annuity policyholders selecting the fixed account option on their contracts, on which we credit interest. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased by $18 million, or 8%, to $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in general operating expenses, offset in part by an increase in deferrals of acquisition costs resulting from increased sales of variable annuities with bonus features, for which a portion of the benefit expense is deferred and amortized over the life of the product. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $20 million, or 10%, to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the impact of a $26 million increase in additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2002 that was primarily attributable to lower equity valuations of assets in our variable annuity separate accounts. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $9 million, or 10%, to $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of the impact of higher dividends received deduction benefits related to separate account annuity products in 2002. 121 Table of Contents Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased $35 million, or 19%, to $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease in segment net earnings was primarily the result of lower policy fees and other income and declining yields on invested assets. The decrease in segment net earnings reflects decreases in net earnings for structured settlement, fixed annuity and GIC products and an increase in net earnings for variable annuity products. The decrease in structured settlements and GICs was primarily attributable to lower reinvestment rates. The decrease in fixed annuities was primarily attributable to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The increase in variable annuities was primarily attributable to tax benefits resulting from higher dividend deductions on our separate accounts. Mortgage Insurance segment The following table sets forth the historical results of operations relating to our Mortgage Insurance segment. The Mortgage Insurance segments results of operations are not affected by any of the pro forma adjustments. Years ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 800 $ 716 $ 677 Net investment income 254 218 231 Policy fees and other income 36 48 38 Total revenues 1,090 982 946 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 165 115 46 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 262 299 233 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 51 37 39 Total benefits and expenses 478 451 318 Earnings before income taxes 612 531 628 Provision for income taxes 186 162 177 Segment net earnings $ 426 $ 369 $ 451 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums increased $84 million, or 12%, to $800 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $125 million increase in premiums in our international mortgage insurance business, $35 million of which was attributable to favorable foreign exchange rates. The increase also was partially attributable to the aging of our international in force block, which resulted in increased earned premiums from prior year new insurance written. The increase in international premiums was partially offset by a $41 million decrease in our U.S. mortgage insurance premiums. This decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums was primarily the result of the decline in our in force block due to decreased demand for mortgage insurance as the result of a smaller market for mortgage originations, as well as a reduction in business from some mortgage lenders following our actions to restructure our captive reinsurance arrangements with premium risk cessions in excess of 25%. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $36 million, or 17%, to $254 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $32 million increase in investment income in our international business, $13 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates, related to the growth in invested assets. Investment income in 122 Table of Contents our U.S. mortgage insurance business increased $4 million due to increasing yields on invested assets. As discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources, our U.S. mortgage insurance business paid a $700 million dividend to our parent holding company in December 2004. This dividend reduced the invested assets in our U.S. mortgage insurance business at the end of 2004. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $12 million, or 25%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $19 million decrease in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to lower refinancing activity in the U.S. This decrease was offset in part by a $7 million increase in fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $50 million, or 43%, to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $28 million increase in U.S. paid losses and a $22 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in claims and loans in default associated with higher insurance in force in our international mortgage insurance business, $4 million of which was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, decreased $37 million, or 12%, to $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $299 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $54 million decrease in expenses primarily attributable to lower underwriting expenses due to a decline in refinancing activity in the U.S. and lower administrative costs, and a $17 million decrease in the provision for indemnity liabilities related to a decline in mortgage loan origination primarily attributable to decreased mortgage refinancing activity. These declines were offset in part by a $34 million increase in expenses to support the expansion of our international mortgage insurance business, $8 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $14 million, or 38%, to $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was partially attributable to a $6 million increase in mortgage insurance amortization in the U.S. primarily due to accelerated amortization reflecting higher than expected early year margins on recently written policies. The increase was also attributable to an $8 million increase in international insurance amortization due primarily to the continued growth of our international business, $2 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $24 million, or 15%, to $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 30.4% and 30.5% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes and an increase in the benefit of tax exempt investment income, offset by the loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE. Our Mortgage Insurance segments effective tax rate is below the statutory rate primarily as a result of tax exempt investment income. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased $57 million, or 15%, to $426 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase in segment net earnings was primarily attributable to a $58 million increase in net earnings attributable to continued growth in our international mortgage insurance business, $23 million of which was due to favorable foreign exchange rates. The relatively constant net earnings in our U.S. mortgage insurance business were primarily attributable to lower expenses, offset by a continued decrease in the in force block and an increase in our paid claims. 123 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $39 million, or 6%, to $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $677 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an $88 million increase in premiums in our international mortgage insurance business, $24 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. This increase in international premiums was offset in part by a $26 million decrease in premiums in our U.S. mortgage insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher premiums ceded in captive reinsurance transactions and a $23 million decrease in premiums that was primarily attributable to lower persistency resulting from increased refinancing activity. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $13 million, or 6%, to $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $42 million decrease in net investment income that was primarily attributable to a decrease in invested assets resulting from the payment of dividends by the U.S. mortgage insurance business to our holding company. The decrease was also the result of declining yields on investments. These decreases were offset in part by a $29 million increase in net investment income resulting from additional invested assets in our international mortgage insurance business, $10 million of which was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $10 million, or 26%, to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $5 million increase in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to higher refinancing activity in the U.S. and a $5 million increase in fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $69 million, or 150%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $60 million increase primarily attributable to a lower amount of favorable loss development on prior year reserves and a $9 million increase in paid claims on U.S. flow mortgage insurance offset in part by a $4 million decrease primarily attributable to favorable loss development on U.S. bulk mortgage insurance, and a $4 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in loans in default associated with higher insurance in force levels in our international mortgage insurance business. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased $66 million, or 28%, to $299 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $37 million increase in expenses that was primarily attributable to a significant increase in underwriting volume associated with refinancing activity in the U.S., an $11 million increase attributable to higher indemnity liabilities for U.S. contract underwriting claims as the result of updating of the assumptions we used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans underwritten due to significant refinancing activity and an $18 million increase attributable to continued investment in our international mortgage insurance business. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $2 million, or 5%, to $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the amortization of a lower amount of U.S. deferred expenses, offset by the higher volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $15 million, or 8%, to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 30.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a greater proportion of foreign income taxed at a higher rate than in the U.S. Our Mortgage Insurance segments effective tax rate is significantly below the statutory rate primarily as the result of tax exempt investment income. 124 Table of Contents Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased $82 million, or 18%, to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $141 million decrease in U.S. net earnings, offset in part by a $59 million increase in international net earnings. The decrease in U.S. net earnings was primarily attributable to greater losses from less favorable loss development on prior year reserves, decreases in premiums from increased ceding and lower persistency, and increases in underwriting expenses from refinancing activity and contract underwriting indemnification liabilities as the result of our updating the assumptions used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and increased volume. The increase in international net earnings was primarily the result of growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Affinity segment The following table sets forth the historical results of operations relating to the Affinity segment. Because we did not acquire any of the Affinity segment businesses from GEFAHI in our corporate reorganization, this segments results of operations are included in our results of operations only for periods through May 24, 2004 and are not included in our pro forma financial information. Years ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 88 $ 244 $ 247 Net investment income 26 62 70 Policy fees and other income 104 260 271 Total revenues 218 566 588 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 80 196 180 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 123 244 312 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 47 105 116 Total benefits and expenses 250 545 608 Earnings (loss) before income taxes (32 ) 21 (20 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (18 ) 5 (17 ) Segment net earnings (loss) $ (14 ) $ 16 $ (3 ) Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenues, benefits and expenses, provision (benefit) for income taxes and segment net earnings for the Affinity segment decreased because the Affinity segments results are not included in our results of operations for periods after May 24, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total revenues. Total revenues decreased $22 million, or 4%, to $566 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $588 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower premiums and other income attributable to our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in premiums attributable to a reinsurance transaction in which certain premiums were ceded to us by the purchaser of a discontinued operation. Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses decreased $63 million, or 10%, to $545 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $608 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships and implement cost savings initiatives that reduced compensation and benefits, as well as other general expenses. Our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships and implement cost savings initiatives also reduced 125 Table of Contents our deferrable expenses, resulting in a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in benefits and expenses attributable to a reinsurance transaction in which certain benefits and expenses were ceded to us by the purchaser of a discontinued operation. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes increased $22 million to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(17) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increased provision was the result of a foreign loss valuation allowance. Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) increased $19 million to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(3) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of our discontinuation of products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds and reductions of compensation and benefit expenses and other general expenses resulting from cost savings initiatives. Corporate and Other segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Corporate and Other segment. There were no pro forma adjustments to premiums or policy fees and other income because there are no premiums or policy fees and other income in the Corporate and Other segment that were ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions. Pro forma net investment income is lower than our historical net investment income primarily as a result of a decrease attributable to reduced net investment income related to the $1.836 billion capital contribution that we made to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization, offset in part by an increase attributable to net investment income earned on excess surplus assets that were transferred from the Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments to the Corporate and Other segment in 2004. Pro forma revenues are lower than our historical revenues primarily as a result of the adjustments to net investment income as described above, as well as the exclusion from our results of operations of net realized investment gains (losses) related to the long term care insurance, structured settlement and variable annuity blocks we ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions and net realized investment gains (losses) related to the Affinity segment. Pro forma expenses are higher than our historical expenses primarily as a result of the interest expense attributable to our debt structure following the IPO, including the offerings of senior notes and commercial paper. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 96 $ 110 $ 104 $ 96 Net investment income 148 61 20 146 Net realized investment gains 26 10 204 23 Policy fees and other income 54 8 6 54 Total revenues 324 189 334 319 Expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 36 76 15 35 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 83 115 112 89 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 17 18 10 18 Interest expense 201 137 124 227 Total expenses 337 346 261 369 Earnings (loss) before income taxes (13 ) (157 ) 73 (50 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (65 ) (103 ) (119 ) (79 ) Segment net earnings (loss) $ 52 $ (54 ) $ 192 $ 29 126 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums decreased $14 million, or 13%, to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased premiums from our Bermuda reinsurer attributable to the run off of certain credit life insurance blocks. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $87 million, or 143%, to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in investment income associated with an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments. The increase was also the result of a $28 million increase in interest income from two securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and an $18 million increase in partnership income. Net realized investment gains. See the comparison for this line item under Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $46 million to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This was primarily the result of a $40 million gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $40 million, or 53%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of lower litigation expenses and higher reserves at our Bermuda reinsurer. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, decreased $32 million, or 28%, to $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of $36 million lower allocated expenses from GE resulting from our corporate reorganization, $26 million of lower litigation expenses and $13 million of lower operating and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by expenses of $20 million relating to the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights in connection with our corporate reorganization and $23 million relating to the costs of establishing the Genworth brand. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $1 million, or 6%, to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $64 million, or 47%, to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of $45 million of interest expense associated with our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization and a $20 million increase attributable to the securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $38 million to ($65) million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from ($103) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decreased benefit was primarily due to a lower pre tax loss in 2004, a one time reduction in U.K. taxes related to the restructuring of our U.K. legal entities and favorable examination developments in 2003, which did not recur in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $47 million of tax benefits recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization. 127 Table of Contents Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) increased $106 million to $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $(54) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net earnings was primarily the result of an $87 million increase in net investment income primarily attributable to an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments, a $46 million tax benefit recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization, a $25 million after tax gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in 2004, and an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments partially offset by a $64 million increase in interest expense attributable to our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $6 million, or 6%, to $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $4 million increase in premiums attributable to our Mexican auto insurer. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $41 million, or 205%, to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $36 million increase relating to the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Net realized investment gains. See the comparison for this line item under Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $2 million to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $61 million, or 407%, to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of certain litigation settlements resulting in an increase in reserves, as well as increased claims in our Mexican auto insurer due to unfavorable weather conditions and increased costs in our Viking reinsurer relating to experience payments on previously novated businesses. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased $3 million, or 3%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $45 million higher litigation expense during 2003, partially offset by $11 million of miscellaneous asset write offs, $10 million of expenses associated with the relocation of our long term care insurance business and $21 million of higher operating expenses during 2002. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $8 million, or 80%, to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $13 million, or 10%, to $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $27 million of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. This increase was offset in part by a $14 million decrease in interest expense that was primarily the result of lower average borrowings. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $16 million to $(103) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(119) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This 128 Table of Contents decrease was the result of the recognition in 2002 of a favorable settlement with the IRS related to the treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders of life insurance contracts, offset in part by lower pre tax earnings, a one time reduction in U.K. taxes related to the restructuring of our U.K. legal entities, and increased dividends received deduction benefits. Changes to tax expense for our Corporate and Other segment are primarily the result of tax exempt investment income and other items not directly allocated to specific products or segments. Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) decreased $246 million to $(54) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in benefit for income taxes attributable to the impact of the 2002 favorable settlement with the IRS, the decrease in net realized investment gains and higher litigation reserves for the year ended December 31, 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We conduct all our operations through our operating subsidiaries. Dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations, including payments of principal and interest on the notes. Our primary uses of funds at our holding company level include payment of general operating expenses, payment of principal, interest and other expenses related to holding company debt, payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock, amounts we will owe to GE under the Tax Matters Agreement, contract adjustment payments on our Equity Units, contributions to subsidiaries, and, potentially, acquisitions. We currently pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate of $0.065 per share. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Our payment of dividends to our stockholders will depend partly upon our receipt of dividends from our insurance and other operating subsidiaries. In addition, our Series A Preferred Stock bears dividends at an annual rate of 5.25% of the liquidation value of $50 per share. We also pay quarterly contract adjustment payments with respect to our Equity Units at an annual rate of 2.16% of the stated amount of $25 per Equity Unit. We declared dividends of $171 million to our parent during 2002, of which $107 million was paid in 2002 and $64 million was paid in 2003. We declared and paid dividends of $3,168 million to our parent during 2003, including a dividend of $2,930 million paid on December 15, 2003. This dividend included the distribution of proceeds from the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which closed on August 29, 2003, and other dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries. During 2004, as part of our corporate reorganization and prior to the IPO, we paid dividends of $2,029 million to our parent. Since the completion of the IPO, we have declared a dividend on our common stock of $32 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2004. The fourth quarter dividend was paid in January 2005. The payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $2,111 million ($1,244 million of which were deemed extraordinary), $1,472 million ($1,400 million of which were deemed extraordinary) and $840 million ($375 million of which were deemed extraordinary), respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received dividends from insurance subsidiaries related to discontinued operations of $0, $495 million and $62 million, respectively. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, also are subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings. Based on statutory results as of December 31, 2004, our subsidiaries could pay dividends of $1,450 million to us in 2005 without obtaining regulatory approval. However, as a result of the dividends we paid in connection with our corporate reorganization, most of our insurance subsidiaries will not be able to pay us dividends until 129 Table of Contents April 15, 2005. As part of our corporate reorganization, we retained cash at the holding company level which we believe will be adequate to fund our dividend payments, debt service, obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement and other obligations until our insurance subsidiaries can resume paying ordinary dividends to us. In addition, we received a dividend of $700 million from our U.S. mortgage insurance business in December 2004 (included above in dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries) following the release of statutory contingency reserves from that business. We used $550 million of those proceeds to repay the Contingent Note, and we have retained the remaining $150 million in a segregated account at our holding company to pay debt servicing expenses and dividends on our common stock. Of this amount, we expect that $50 million will be available for disbursement during 2005, and $100 million will be available for disbursement during 2006. In addition to dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, our other sources of funds will include service fees we receive from GE, as described under Overview Separation from GE and related financial arrangements Services provided to GE, payments from our subsidiaries pursuant to tax sharing arrangements, borrowings pursuant to our credit facilities, and proceeds from any additional issuance of commercial paper. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion note and the $550 million Contingent Note. As described above, the Contingent Note was repaid in December 2004 with a portion of the proceeds of a $700 million dividend paid to us by our U.S. mortgage insurance business. We repaid the $2.4 billion note upon the completion of the IPO with borrowings under a short term credit facility. We repaid those borrowings shortly thereafter with proceeds from our offering of $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. The $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes includes $500 million LIBOR Floating Rate Notes due 2007, $500 million 4.75% Notes due 2009, $600 million 5.75% Notes due 2014, and $300 million 6.50% Notes due 2034. As a result of hedging arrangements entered into with respect to these securities, our effective interest rates are 3.53% on the 2007 notes, 4.48% on the 2009 notes, 5.51% on the 2014 notes and 6.35% on the 2034 notes. The commercial paper was issued under a $1 billion commercial paper program that we have established. We may issue additional commercial paper under this program from time to time. The liabilities we assumed from GEFAHI include the Yen Notes, which are &yen;60 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.60% notes due 2011 issued by GEFAHI, &yen;3 billion of which GEFAHI held and transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. In the third quarter of 2004, we retired the &yen;3 billion of Yen Notes that were transferred to us. We have entered into arrangements to swap our obligations under the Yen Notes to a U.S. dollar obligation with a principal amount of $491 million and bearing interest at a rate of 4.84% per annum. In connection with our corporate reorganization, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with GE, which represents an obligation by us to GE that is estimated to have a present value of approximately $389 million. In connection with our corporate reorganization, we also entered into $2 billion of revolving credit facilities, including a $1.0 billion 364 day facility and a $1.0 billion five year facility. The revolving credit facilities support our commercial paper program and provide us with liquidity to meet general funding requirements. We expect to replace the 364 day facility upon its expiration with a similar or longer term credit facility. Our ability to borrow under these facilities and to issue commercial paper in excess of $500 million in the aggregate may be subject to GEs right as the holder of the Class B Common Stock to approve our incurrence of debt in excess of $700 million outstanding at any one time (subject to certain exceptions). We believe our revolving credit facilities, further issuances under our commercial paper program and anticipated cash flows from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. For further information about our borrowings, see note 14 to our financial statements, included in Item 8. of this Annual Report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,498 million, $3,716 million and $4,883 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums received, fees received and investment income. Principal sources of cash include sales 130 Table of Contents of our products and services. The increase in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 of $1,782 million and the decrease in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 of $1,167 million was primarily the result of the timing of cash settlement for other assets and liabilities. As an insurance business, we typically generate positive cash flows from operating and financing activities, as premiums and deposits collected from our insurance and investment products exceed benefits paid and redemptions, and we invest the excess. Accordingly, in analyzing our cash flow we focus on the change in the amount of cash available and used in investing activities. Net cash from investing activities was $(5,404) million, $(681) million and $(6,525) million for the years December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, of $4,723 million was primarily the result of a $1,621 million decrease in cash provided by the proceeds from the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses in 2003 that did not recur in 2004 and an increase of $2,057 million in net investment purchases. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, of $5,844 million was the result of both less cash provided by operating activities of $1,167 million, as discussed above, and more cash used in financing activities of $5,007 million. Within our investing activities, during 2003, we received $2,126 million of proceeds and dividends associated with the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses. Net cash from financing activities was $(791) million, $(2,714) and $2,293 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Changes in cash from financing activities primarily relate to the issuance and repayment of borrowings, dividends to our stockholders and other capital transactions, as well as the issuance of, and redemptions and benefit payments on, investment contracts. The $1,923 million increase in cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, was primarily the result of an increase in net cash flows from our stockholder, primarily in transactions related to our corporate reorganization, of $2,430 million, as well as the issuance of long term borrowings of $1,895 million and lower net redemptions and deposits in investment contracts of $678 million, partially offset by the decrease in net short term borrowings of $2,713 million and the repayment of the $550 million Contingent Note. The decrease in cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, of $5,007 million was primarily the result of both lower deposits and higher redemptions of investment contracts, as a result of the lower interest rate environment, equity market downturns and volatility and pricing actions we took. These factors contributed to a decrease in the use of net cash from investment contracts by $3,202 million. In addition, dividends paid to our stockholder, net of capital contributions received, increased by $2,871 million. These increased uses of cash were partially offset by a net increase in cash provided from borrowings of $1,066 million, consisting of a net increase in short term borrowings, including commercial paper, of $466 million, and an increase in non recourse funding obligations of $600 million. The liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries principally relate to the liabilities associated with their various insurance and investment products, operating costs and expenses, the payment of dividends to us, contributions to their subsidiaries, payment of principal and interest on their outstanding debt obligations and income taxes. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment products include the payment of benefits, as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders and withdrawals, policy loans and obligations to redeem funding agreements under applicable put option provisions. Historically, our insurance subsidiaries have used cash flow from operations and sales of investment securities to fund their liquidity requirements. Our insurance subsidiaries principal cash inflows from operating activities derive from premiums, annuity deposits and policy and contract fees and other income, including commissions, cost of insurance, mortality, expense and surrender charges, contract underwriting fees, investment management fees, and dividends and distributions from their subsidiaries. The principal cash inflows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, sales of invested assets and investment income. 131 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $2.8 billion of renewable floating rate funding agreements, which are deposit type products that generally credit interest on deposits at a floating rate tied to an external market index. Purchasers of renewable funding agreements include money market funds, bank common trust funds and other short term investors. Some of our funding agreements contain put provisions, through which the contractholder has an option to terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contracts specified notice period, which is generally 90 days. Of the $2.8 billion aggregate amount outstanding as of December 31, 2004, $1.6 billion had put option features, none of which were less than 90 days. GE Capital has guaranteed certain obligations under floating rate funding agreements with a final maturity on or before June 30, 2005. This guarantee covers our obligations to contractholders and requires us to reimburse GE Capital for any payments made to contractholders under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2004, GE Capitals guarantee covered $1.4 billion of outstanding floating rate funding agreements. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain investment strategies intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. Products having liabilities with longer durations, such as certain life insurance and long term care insurance policies, are matched with investments having similar estimated lives such as long term fixed maturities and mortgage loans. Shorter term liabilities are matched with fixed maturities that have short and medium term fixed maturities. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries hold highly liquid, high quality short term investment securities and other liquid investment grade fixed maturities to fund anticipated operating expenses, surrenders, and withdrawals. As of December 31, 2004, our total cash and invested assets was $67.1 billion. Our investments in privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests and restricted investments held by securitization entities are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented approximately 30% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2004. Total assets were $103.9 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $103.4 billion as of December 31, 2003. Total assets remained relatively unchanged, with an increase in assets primarily attributable to normal business growth, partially offset by a decrease of $5.7 billion of assets that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. Total liabilities were $91.0 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $87.6 billion as of December 31, 2003. This increase of $3.4 billion was primarily due to growth in contractholder liabilities, as well as the issuance of $600 million of our Equity Units and $100 million of our mandatorily redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, partially offset by the tax impact of our corporate reorganization and other liabilities that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. Contractual obligations We enter into obligations to third parties in the ordinary course of our operations. These obligations, as of December 31, 2004, are set forth in the table below. However, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations. The most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers. Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, also will vary based upon our future needs. Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. Examples of fixed obligations include our obligations to pay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings. Examples of obligations that will vary include obligations to pay interest on variable rate borrowings and insurance liabilities that depend on future interest rates and market performance. Many of our obligations are linked to cash generating contracts. These obligations include payments to contractholders that assume those contractholders will continue to make deposits in accordance with the terms of their contracts. In addition, our operations involve significant expenditures that are not based upon commitments. These include expenditures for income taxes and payroll. 132 Table of Contents Payments due by period (Dollar amounts in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 and thereafter Borrowings(1) $ 4,606 $ 559 $ 500 $ 1,100 $ 2,447 Operating lease obligations 139 29 47 37 26 Purchase obligations(2) 289 149 56 48 36 Insurance liabilities(3) 60,643 10,060 13,623 10,393 26,567 Other contractual liabilities(4) 625 31 41 54 499 Total contractual obligations $ 66,302 $ 10,828 $ 14,267 $ 11,632 $ 29,575 (1) Includes principal of our short and long term borrowings, non recourse funding obligations, senior notes underlying equity units and mandatorily redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, as described in note 14 to our financial statements.

(4) Because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following non current liabilities are excluded from this table: deferred taxes (except the Tax Matters Agreement, which is included, as described in note 15 to our financial statements), derivatives, deferred revenue and certain other items. Impairments of Investment Securities We regularly review investment securities for impairment in accordance with our impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position, and for fixed maturities, whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Our qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent to hold the security until recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams, as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of GEAM and other third party asset managers, as required. Our qualitative review attempts to identify those issuers with a greater than 50% chance of default in the coming twelve months. These securities are characterized as at risk of impairment. As of December 31, 2004, securities at risk of impairment had aggregate unrealized losses of approximately $50 million. For fixed maturities, we recognize an impairment charge to earnings in the period in which we determine that we do not expect either to collect principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments or to recover based upon underlying collateral values, considering events such as a payment default, bankruptcy or disclosure of fraud. For equity securities, we recognize an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that the security will not recover to book value within a reasonable period. We determine what constitutes a reasonable period on a security by security basis based upon consideration of all the evidence available to us, including the magnitude of an unrealized loss and its duration. In any event, this period does not exceed 18 months for common equity securities. We measure impairment charges based upon the difference between the book value of a security and its fair value. Fair value is based upon quoted market price, except for certain infrequently traded securities where we estimate values using internally developed pricing models. These models are based upon common valuation techniques and require us to make assumptions regarding credit quality, liquidity and other factors that affect estimated values. The carrying value of infrequently traded securities as of December 31, 2004 was $12.3 billion. 133 Table of Contents For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized impairments of $26 million and $224 million, respectively. We generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they recover. However, from time to time, we sell securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio to meet diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the pre tax realized investment loss incurred on the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities was $38 million. The aggregate fair value of securities sold at a loss during twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 billion, which was approximately 98.6% of book value. The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values of our investment securities, aggregated by investment type and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004: Less Than 12 Months (Dollar amounts in millions) Amortized costor cost Estimated fairvalue Grossunrealizedlosses % below cost # of securities Description of Securities Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agencies $ 115 $ 114 $ (1 ) 0.9 % 15 State and municipal 89 88 (1 ) 1.1 % 28 Government non U.S. 225 222 (3 ) 1.3 % 32 U.S. corporate 3,496 3,426 (70 ) 2.0 % 400 Corporate non U.S. 1,224 1,207 (17 ) 1.4 % 155 Asset Backed 857 853 (4 ) 0.5 % 125 Mortgage Backed 2,807 2,776 (31 ) 1.1 % 259 Subtotal, fixed maturities 8,813 8,686 (127 ) 1.4 % 1,014 Equities securities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 % Below cost fixed maturities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 8,799 $ 8,678 $ (121 ) 1.4 % 1,002 20 50% Below cost 14 8 (6 ) 42.9 % 6 &gt;50% Below cost 6 Total fixed maturities 8,813 8,686 (127 ) 1.4 % 1,014 % Below cost equity securities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 7 $ 7 $ 12 20 50% Below cost &gt;50% Below cost 1 Total equity maturities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 Investment grade $ 8,026 $ 7,930 $ (96 ) 1.2 % 869 Below investment grade 600 575 (25 ) 4.2 % 114 Not Rated Fixed maturities 187 181 (6 ) 3.2 % 31 Not Rated Equities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 134 Table of Contents 12 Months or More (Dollar amounts in millions) Amortized costor cost Estimated fairvalue Grossunrealizedlosses % below cost # of securities Description of Securities Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agencies $ 3 $ 3 $ 1 State and municipal 1 1 2 Government non U.S. 106 106 30 U.S. corporate 834 763 (71 ) 8.5 % 127 Corporate non U.S. 181 176 (5 ) 2.8 % 35 Asset Backed 55 54 (1 ) 1.8 % 5 Mortgage Backed 244 233 (11 ) 4.5 % 78 Subtotal, fixed maturities 1,424 1,336 (88 ) 6.2 % 278 Equities securities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 % Below cost fixed maturities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 1,319 $ 1,262 $ (57 ) 4.3 % 234 20 50% Below cost 95 69 (26 ) 27.4 % 23 &gt;50% Below cost 10 5 (5 ) 50.0 % 21 Total fixed maturities 1,424 1,336 (88 ) 6.2 % 278 % Below cost equity securities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 21 $ 20 $ (1 ) 4.8 % 8 20 50% Below cost 2 1 (1 ) 50.0 % 10 &gt;50% Below cost 1 Total equity maturities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 Investment grade $ 973 $ 934 $ (39 ) 4.0 % 188 Below investment grade 450 401 (49 ) 10.9 % 88 Not Rated Fixed maturities 1 1 2 Not Rated Equities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 for less than twelve months account for $127 million, or 58%, of our total unrealized losses. Of the securities in this category, there were three securities with an unrealized loss in excess of $5 million. These three securities had aggregate unrealized losses of $18 million. The amount of the unrealized loss on these securities is driven primarily by the relative size of the holdings, the par values of which range from $15 million to $386 million, the maturities, which range from 2010 to 2036, and the credit quality of the issuers. The issuer of the investment scheduled to mature in 2010 prepaid the related principal and interest along with a prepayment fee in January 2005. The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 for twelve months or more account for $90 million, or 42%, of our total unrealized losses. There are 104 fixed maturities in four industry groups that account for $54 million, or 60%, of the unrealized losses in this category. Forty four of these 104 securities are in the finance and insurance sector. Within this sector, no single issue has unrealized losses greater than $5 million. The unrealized losses of these securities are due primarily to changes in interest rates from the time the securities were purchased. Thirty five of these 104 securities are in the transportation sector and are related to the airline industry. All of our airline securities, with one exception, are collateralized by commercial jet aircraft associated with several 135 Table of Contents domestic airlines and one cargo airline. The collateral underlying these securities consists of commercial jet aircraft, except for one that is secured by airline ticket receivables. We believe these security holdings are in a temporary loss position as a result of ongoing negative market reaction to difficulties in the commercial airline industry. Within this sector, we have recognized $1 million and $36 million of other than temporary impairments in 2004 and 2003, respectively. These holdings were written down to estimated fair value based upon the present value of expected cash flows associated with revised lease terms or the value of the underlying aircraft. As of December 31, 2004, we expect to collect full principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments of our remaining holdings in airline securities. For those airline securities that we have previously impaired, we expect to recover our carrying amount based upon underlying aircraft collateral values. Fourteen of these 104 securities are in the consumer non cyclical sector, of which there was one issuer with unrealized losses in excess of $5 million. This issuer, which had a $7 million unrealized loss, is in the tobacco industry, is current on all terms, shows improving trends with regards to liquidity and security price and is not considered at risk of impairment. Each of the other securities in this sector has unrealized losses of less than $5 million. Eleven of these 104 securities are in the consumer non cyclical sector, of which there was one issuer with unrealized losses in excess of $5 million. The aggregate par value of securities was $37 million. This issuer is current on all terms and is not considered at risk of impairment. In the remaining industry sectors, as of December 31, 2004, one issuer of fixed maturity securities had an unrealized loss of $5 million. This issuer is current on all terms, has sufficient liquidity to service current debt obligations and is seeking additional financing. No other single issuer of fixed maturities in these sectors has an unrealized loss of greater than $5 million. The equity securities in an unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004, for twelve months or more are primarily preferred stocks with fixed maturity like characteristics. No single security had an unrealized loss greater than $2 million. Off balance Sheet Transactions We have used off balance sheet securitization transactions to mitigate and diversify our asset risk position and to adjust the asset class mix in our investment portfolio by reinvesting securitization proceeds in accordance with our approved investment guidelines. We have not used securitization transactions to provide us with additional liquidity, and we do not anticipate using securitization transactions for that purpose in the future. The transactions we have used involved securitizations of some of our receivables and investments that were secured by commercial mortgage loans, fixed maturities or other receivables, consisting primarily of policy loans. Total securitized assets remaining as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were $1.6 billion. Securitization transactions resulted in net gains, before taxes, of approximately $43 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and were included in net realized investment gains (losses) in our financial statements. There were no securitization transactions in the year ended December 31, 2004. We have arranged for the assets that we have transferred in securitization transactions to be serviced by us directly or pursuant to arrangements and with General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Servicing activities include ongoing review, credit monitoring, reporting and collection activities. We have entered into credit support arrangements in connection with our securitization transactions. Pursuant to these arrangements, as of December 31, 2004, we provided limited recourse for a maximum of $119 million of credit losses. To date, we have not yet been required to make payments under any of these credit support agreements. The agreements will remain in place throughout the life of the related entities. 136 Table of Contents GE Capital, our indirect parent and majority stockholder, provides credit and liquidity support to a funding conduit it sponsored, which exposes it to a majority of the risks and rewards of the conduits activities and therefore makes GE Capital the primary beneficiary of the funding conduit. Upon adoption of FIN 46, GE Capital was required to consolidate the funding conduit because of this financial support. As a result, assets and liabilities of certain previously off balance sheet securitization entities, for which we were the transferor, were required to be included in our financial statements because the funding conduit no longer qualified as a third party. Because these securitization entities lost their qualifying status, we were required to include $1.2 billion of securitized assets and $1.1 billion of associated liabilities in our Statement of Financial Position in July 2003. The assets and liabilities associated with these securitization entities have been reported in the corresponding financial statement captions in our Statement of Financial Position, and the assets are noted as restricted due to the lack of legal control we have over them. These balances will decrease as the assets mature because we will not sell any additional assets to these consolidated entities. Our inclusion of these assets and liabilities does not change the economic or legal characteristics of the asset sales. Liabilities of these consolidated entities will be repaid with cash flows generated by the related assets. Credit recourse to us remains limited to the credit support described above. We included $36 million of revenue, $2 million of general expenses and $27 million of interest expense associated with these newly consolidated entities in our historical financial statements for the period from July 1 to December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we included $64 million of revenue, $3 million of general expenses and $47 million of interest expense associated with these entities in our historical financial statements. Our consolidation of these securitization entities had no effect on our previously reported earnings. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities associated with the securitization entities we included in our Statement of Financial Position, which are part of our Corporate and Other segment as of the dates indicated: December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Assets: Restricted investments held by securitization entities $ 860 $ 1,069 Other assets 24 65 Total(1) $ 884 $ 1,134 Liabilities: Borrowings related to securitization entities $ 849 $ 1,018 Other liabilities 3 59 Total $ 852 $ 1,077 (1) Includes $31 million and $51 million of retained interests in securitized assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, that are consolidated. Seasonality In general, our business as a whole is not seasonal in nature. However, in our Mortgage Insurance segment, the level of defaults, which increases the likelihood of losses, tends to decrease in the first and second quarters of the calendar year and increase in the third and fourth quarters. As a result, we have experienced lower levels of losses resulting from defaults in the first and second quarters, as compared with the third and fourth quarters. Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our historical results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates. 137 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Currently effective In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03 1 (SOP 03 1), Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts, which we adopted on January 1, 2004. SOP 03 1 provides guidance on separate account presentation and valuation, accounting for sales inducements to contractholders and classification and valuation of long duration contract liabilities. Prior to adopting SOP 03 1 we held reserves for the higher tier annuitization benefit on two tiered annuities. To record these reserves in accordance with SOP 03 1, we released $10 million, or 7%, of our two tiered annuity reserves and $3 million of guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves. After giving effect to the impact of additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to these reserve releases, we recorded a $5 million benefit in cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of taxes, which is not reflected in net earnings from continuing operations. Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123R Share Based Payments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, which we will adopt on July 1, 2005. This statement provides additional guidance on accounting for share based payments and will require all such awards to be measured at fair value with the related compensation cost recognized in income on a prospective basis. We currently recognize compensation cost using the fair value method for all stock based awards issued after January 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded. The following is a discussion of our market risk exposures and our risk management practices. We enter into market sensitive instruments primarily for purposes other than trading. The carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $66 billion and $79 billion, respectively, of which 80% and 83%, respectively, was invested in fixed maturities. The primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities. We mitigate the market risk associated with our fixed maturities portfolio by closely matching the duration of our fixed maturities with the duration of the liabilities that those securities are intended to support. The primary market risk for our long term borrowings and Equity Units is interest rate risk at the time of maturity or early redemption, when we may be required to refinance these obligations. We continue to monitor the interest rate environment and to evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. We are exposed to equity risk on our holdings of common stocks and other equities. We manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. We also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Our international operations generate revenues denominated in local currencies, and we invest cash generated outside the U.S. in non U.S. denominated securities. Although investing in securities denominated in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, we remain exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our historical combined financial statements. We currently do not hedge this exposure. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 29% and 26%, respectively, of our net earnings from continuing operations were generated by our international operations. 138 Table of Contents We use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate and currency swaps, currency forwards and option based financial instruments, as part of our risk management strategy. We use these derivatives to mitigate certain risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk and equity risk, by: reducing the risk between the timing of the receipt of cash and its investment in the market; matching the currency of invested assets with the liabilities they support; converting the asset duration to match the duration of the liabilities; reducing our exposure to fluctuations in equity market indices that underlie some of our products; and protecting against the early termination of an asset or liability. As a matter of policy, we have not and will not engage in derivative market making, speculative derivative trading or other speculative derivatives activities. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market rates or prices on the profitability of market sensitive financial instruments. The following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices is based on so called shock tests, which model the effects of interest rate, foreign exchange rate and equity market price shifts on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe shock tests provide the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, they are constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. Although the following results of shock tests for changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices may have some limited use as benchmarks, they should not be viewed as forecasts. These forward looking disclosures also are selective in nature and address only the potential impacts on our financial instruments. They do not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of these changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity market prices. One means of assessing exposure of our fixed maturities portfolio to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential changes in market value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points across all maturities. This is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve. Under this model, with all other factors constant and assuming no offsetting change in the value of our liabilities, we estimated that such an increase in interest rates would cause the market value of our fixed income securities portfolio to decline by approximately $2.9 billion, based on our securities positions as of December 31, 2004. One means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis. We analyzed our combined currency exposure as of December 31, 2004, including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges to identify assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their relevant functional currencies. Net unhedged exposures in each currency were then remeasured, generally assuming a 10% decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Under this model, with all other factors constant, we estimated as of December 31, 2004, that such a decrease would have an insignificant effect on our net earnings from continuing operations. One means of assessing exposure to changes in equity market prices is to estimate the potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 10%. Under this model, with all other factors constant, we estimated that such a decline in equity market prices would cause the market value of our equity investments to decline by approximately $8 million, 139 Table of Contents based on our equity positions as of December 31, 2004. In addition, fluctuations in equity market prices affect our revenues and returns from our separate account and private asset management products, which depend upon fees that are related primarily to the value of assets under management. Counterparty credit risk We manage counterparty credit risk on an individual counterparty basis, which means that gains and losses are netted for each counterparty to determine the amount at risk. When a counterparty exceeds credit exposure limits (see table below) in terms of amounts owed to us, typically as the result of changes in market conditions, no additional transactions are executed until the exposure with that counterparty is reduced to an amount that is within the established limit. All swaps are executed under master swap agreements containing mutual credit downgrade provisions that provide the ability to require assignment or termination in the event either party is downgraded below Moodys A3 or S&Ps A . Swaps, purchased options and forwards with contractual maturities longer than one year are conducted within the credit policy constraints provided in the table below. Our policy permits us to enter into derivative transactions with counterparties rated A3 by Moodys and A by S&P if the agreements governing such transactions require both parties to provide collateral in certain circumstances. Our policy further requires foreign exchange forwards with contractual maturities shorter than one year to be executed with counterparties having a credit rating by Moodys of A 1 and by S&P of P 1 and the credit limit for these transactions is $150 million per counterparty.

Cautionary note regarding forward looking statements This Annual Report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements may be identified by words such as expects, intends, anticipates, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, will, or words of similar meaning 93 Table of Contents and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance. Forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially due to global political, economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, including the items identified above under Risk Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Overview Our business We are a leading insurance company in the U.S., with an expanding international presence. We have three operating segments: Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, and Mortgage Insurance. Protection. We offer U.S. customers life insurance, long term care insurance and, primarily for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, group life and health insurance. In Europe, we offer payment protection insurance, which helps consumers meet their payment obligations in the event of illness, involuntary unemployment, disability or death. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Protection segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $527 million. Retirement Income and Investments. We offer U.S. customers fixed and variable deferred annuities, income annuities, variable life insurance, asset management and specialized products, including guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and structured settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Retirement Income and Investments segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $148 million. Mortgage Insurance. In the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, we offer mortgage insurance products that facilitate homeownership by enabling borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages. For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Mortgage Insurance segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $426 million. We also have a Corporate and Other segment, which consists primarily of unallocated corporate income and expenses (including amounts accrued in settlement of class action lawsuits), the results of small, non core businesses that are managed outside our operating segments, most of our interest and other financing expenses and net realized investment gains (losses). For the year ended December 31, 2004, our Corporate and Other segment had pro forma segment net earnings of $29 million. Our corporate reorganization We were incorporated in Delaware on October 23, 2003 in preparation for our corporate reorganization and the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GEFAHI. GEFAHI is an indirect subsidiary of GE and prior to the completion of the IPO, was a holding company for a group of companies that provide life insurance, long term care insurance, group life and health insurance, annuities and other investment products and U.S. mortgage insurance. We also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the Genworth management team. These businesses include international mortgage insurance, payment protection insurance based in Europe, a Bermuda reinsurer and mortgage contract underwriting. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion short term note and a $550 million contingent non interest bearing note. We refinanced the $2.4 billion note with $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper shortly after the IPO, and we repaid the contingent note in December 2004. 94 Table of Contents Our historical and pro forma financial information The historical financial information has been derived from our financial statements, which have been prepared as if Genworth had been in existence throughout all relevant periods. Our historical financial information and statements include all businesses that were owned by GEFAHI, including those that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization, as well as the other insurance businesses that we acquired from other GE subsidiaries in connection with our corporate reorganization. In addition to our three operating segments and our Corporate and Other segment, our historical financial statements also include the results of (1) the Partnership Marketing Group business, which offers life and health insurance, auto club memberships and other financial products and services directly to consumers through affinity marketing arrangements with a variety of organizations, (2) an institutional asset management business owned by GEFAHI, and (3) several other small businesses owned by GEFAHI that are not part of our core ongoing business. The Partnership Marketing Group historically included UFLIC, a subsidiary that offered life and health insurance products through affinity marketing arrangements. In connection with the IPO, GEFAHI transferred UFLIC to General Electric Capital Services, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of GE. We did not acquire the Partnership Marketing Group business, the institutional asset management business or these other small businesses from GEFAHI, and their results are presented as a separate operating segment under the caption Affinity. Our historical financial statements also include our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which we sold on August 29, 2003, and which are presented in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations. The unaudited pro forma information presented herein reflects our historical financial information, as adjusted to give effect to the transactions described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2004. Revenues and expenses Our revenues consist primarily of the following: Protection. The revenues in our Protection segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on individual life, individual long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies; net investment income on the separate investment portfolio held by our payment protection insurance business or allocated to this segments other lines of business; and policy fees and other income, including fees for mortality and surrender charges primarily from universal life insurance policies, and other administrative charges. Retirement Income and Investments. The revenues in our Retirement Income and Investments segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies; net investment income allocated to this segment; and policy fees and other income, including surrender charges, mortality and expense charges, investment management fees and commissions. Mortgage Insurance. The revenues in our Mortgage Insurance segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on mortgage insurance policies; net investment income on the segments separate investment portfolio; and policy fees and other income, including fees from contract underwriting services. 95 Table of Contents Corporate and Other. The revenues in our Corporate and Other segment consist primarily of: net premiums, policy fees and other income from the insurance businesses in this segment; unallocated net investment income; and net realized investment gains (losses). We allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Protection (except payment protection insurance) and Retirement Income and Investments segments using an approach based principally upon the investment portfolio established to support each of those segments products and targeted capital levels. We do not allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Mortgage Insurance segment or to our payment protection insurance product within the Protection segment, because they have their own separate investment portfolios, and the net investment income from those portfolios is reflected in the Mortgage Insurance and Protection segment results. In our historical financial statements, we allocated net investment income to our Affinity segment in the same manner that we allocated these items to our Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments. All net realized investment gains (losses) are reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and are not reflected in the results of any of our other segments. Our expenses consist primarily of the following: benefits provided to policyholders and contractholders and changes in reserves; interest credited on general account balances; underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, including commissions, marketing expenses, policy and contract servicing costs, overhead and other general expenses that are not capitalized (shown net of deferrals); amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other intangible assets; interest and other financing expenses; and income taxes. We allocate corporate expenses to each of our operating segments based on the amount of capital allocated to that segment. Business trends and conditions In recent years, our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry wide and product specific trends and conditions. Market and economic environment Aging U.S. population with growing retirement income needs. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, from 1945 to 2003, U.S. life expectancy at birth increased from 62.9 years to 74.4 years for men and from 68.4 years to 79.5 years for women, respectively, and life expectancy is expected to increase further. In addition, increasing numbers of baby boomers are approaching retirement age. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the percentage of the U.S. population aged 55 or older will increase from approximately 22% (65 million) in 2004 to more than 29% (97 million) in 2020. These increases in life expectancy and the average age of the U.S. population heighten the risk that individuals will outlive their retirement savings. In addition, approximately $4.4 trillion of invested financial assets (25% of all U.S. invested financial assets) are held by people within 10 years of retirement and will be available to be converted to income as those people retire, and approximately $3.3 trillion of invested financial assets are held by individuals who are under age 70 and consider themselves retired, in each case according to a survey conducted by SRI Consulting Business Intelligence in 2002. We believe these trends will lead to growing demand for retirement income and investment products, such as our annuities and other investment products, that help consumers accumulate assets and provide reliable retirement income. 96 Table of Contents Growing lifestyle protection gap. The aging U.S. population and a number of other factors are creating a significant lifestyle protection gap for a growing number of individuals. This gap is the result of individuals not having sufficient resources, including insurance coverage, to ensure that their future assets and income will be adequate to support their desired future lifestyle. Other factors contributing to this gap include declining individual savings rates, rising healthcare and nursing care costs, and a shifting of the burden for funding protection needs from governments and employers to individuals. Recent reductions in employer paid benefits by many companies, coupled with uncertainty over the future of government benefit programs, underscore the potential for long term benefit reductions from these traditional sources and the potential need for individuals to identify alternative sources of these benefits. At the same time, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal savings rates decreased from 10.8% in 1984 to 1.0% in 2004. Consumers are exposed to the rising costs of healthcare and nursing care during their retirement years, and some experts believe that many consumers are underinsured with respect to their protection needs. We expect these trends to result in increased demand for our life, long term care and small group life and health insurance products. Increasing opportunities for mortgage insurance internationally and in the U.S. We believe a number of factors have contributed and will contribute to the growth of mortgage insurance in Canada, Australia and the U.S., where we have significant mortgage insurance operations. These factors include increasing homeownership levels (spurred in part by government housing policies that favor homeownership and demographic factors driving demand for housing); expansion of low down payment mortgage loan offerings; legislative and regulatory policies that provide capital incentives for lenders to transfer the risks of low down payment mortgages to mortgage insurers; and expansion of secondary mortgage markets that require credit enhancements, such as mortgage insurance. We believe a number of these factors also are becoming evident in some European, Latin American, and Asian markets, where lenders increasingly are using mortgage insurance to manage the risks of their loan portfolios and to expand low down payment lending. General conditions and trends affecting our businesses Interest rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a significant effect on our sales of insurance and investment products and our margins on these products. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. In our Retirement Income and Investments and Protection segments, low market interest rates may reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to policyholders and contractholders and the yield we earn on the investments that support these obligations. In response to the unusually low interest rates that have prevailed during the last several years, we have reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on newly issued fixed annuity contracts and have reduced crediting rates on in force contracts where permitted to do so. These actions have helped mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our spreads and profitability on these products. A gradual increase in interest rates generally would have a favorable effect on the profitability of these products. However, rapidly rising interest rates also could result in reduced persistency in our spread based retail products as contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. In our Protection segment, the pricing and expected future profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products are based in part on expected investment returns. Over time, term life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as we receive them. Low interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products. The impact of interest rate fluctuations on our universal life insurance products is similar to their impact on spread based products in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. In our Mortgage Insurance segment, increasing interest rates in 2004 have contributed to a decrease in new mortgage originations in the U.S. and a resulting decrease in new mortgage insurance written. Our U.S. new insurance written decreased by 58% from $67.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $28.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily because of increased interest rates. Higher interest rates in 2004 and 97 Table of Contents the significant refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 also resulted in reduced refinancing activity in 2004, which had a positive impact on U.S. flow persistency. U.S. flow persistency rates increased from 46% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 65% for the year ended December 31, 2004, excluding the effect of a periodic payoff reconciliation on one structured transaction involving single premium mortgage insurance that today would be classified as bulk insurance. We expect that continued interest rate increases will have a favorable impact on persistency and an adverse impact on new mortgage originations and new mortgage insurance written. Volatile equity markets. Equity market volatility may discourage purchases of separate account products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products. Equity market volatility also affects the value of the assets in our separate accounts, which, in turn, affects our earnings from fee based products. After several years of declines, equity markets increased in 2003 and 2004, and we expect that increases or relative stability in equity markets could have a favorable impact on our sales of variable products and our earnings from those products. The potential impact of volatile equity markets on our results has been significantly reduced as a result of our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC, pursuant to which we reinsured, effective as of January 1, 2004, substantially all of our in force blocks of variable annuities. We retain variable annuities sold after January 1, 2004 for our own account, subject to third party reinsurance transactions in the ordinary course of business, and therefore we bear the risk of any adverse impact of future equity market fluctuations on those annuities. In addition, fluctuations in the equity markets may affect revenues and returns from our private asset management products and services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management. Credit default risk. As a result of the economic downturn in 2000 through 2002 and some high profile corporate bankruptcies and scandals, the number of companies defaulting on their debt obligations increased dramatically in 2001 and 2002. These defaults and other declines in the value of some of our investments resulted in impairment charges. Credit defaults have decreased in recent years as the economy has improved. Charges associated with impairments of investments were $26 million, $224 million, and $343 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A weakening in the economic recovery could lead to increased credit defaults. Investment portfolio. The yield on our investment portfolio is affected by the practice, prior to our separation from GE, of realizing investment gains through the sale of appreciated securities and other assets during a period of historically low interest rates. This strategy had been pursued to offset impairments and losses in our investment portfolio, fund consolidations and restructurings in our business and provide current income. Our gross realized gains were $473 million and $790 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This strategy has had an adverse impact on the yield on our investment portfolio and our net investment income as we typically sold higher yielding securities and reinvested the proceeds in lower yielding securities during periods of declining or low interest rates. The impact is most significant in the Retirement Income and Investments segment, which has a higher percentage of our fixed maturities allocated to it than to our other segments. Since our separation from GE, our investment strategy has been to optimize investment income without relying on realized investment gains. As a result, our gross realized gains decreased to $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We also are currently experiencing a challenging interest rate environment in which the yields that we can achieve on new investments are lower than the aggregate yield on our existing portfolio. This environment has resulted in a decline in our overall investment yield, from 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 5.8% and 5.5% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We seek to mitigate this decline in investment yields by continuously evaluating our asset class mix, pursuing additional investment classes and accepting additional credit risk when we believe that it is prudent to do so. A continued increase in prevailing interest rates also will mitigate this decline, whereas a decrease in interest rates could lead to further declines. Globalization. Historically, we have derived a majority of our revenues and profits from our operations in the U.S. However, in recent years, our international business has grown and has had an increasing impact on our 98 Table of Contents financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 19%, 18% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and 29%, 26% and 12% of our net earnings from continuing operations, respectively, were generated by our international operations. These increases were largely due to growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Our payment protection insurance business also derives revenues in the countries where it offers its products. We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our financial statements. As a result, period to period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $31 million and $25 million, respectively, due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our four principal foreign currencies are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the euro. Ongoing operating cost reductions and efficiencies. Our underwriting, acquisition, and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, have decreased to 16% of our revenues in 2004 from 18% in 1999. We continually focus on reducing our cost base while maintaining strong service levels for our customers. We expect to accomplish this goal in each of our operating units through a wide range of cost management disciplines, including consolidating operations, using low cost operating locations, reducing supplier costs, leveraging process improvement efforts, forming dedicated teams to identify opportunities for cost reductions and investing in new technology, particularly for web based, digital end to end processes. Developments affecting our product lines The following business trends and conditions have had a significant impact on our products during the last three years: Life insurance. Regulation XXX requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees. In response to this regulation, we increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves, implemented reinsurance and capital management actions and increased our premium rates for term life insurance products in March 2003. This increase in premium rates has contributed to lower term life insurance sales in 2003 and 2004. Our annualized first year premiums and deposits for term and universal life insurance products decreased by 16% from $195 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $164 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and by 12% to $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our pricing, reinsurance and capital management actions in response to Regulation XXX have collectively enabled us to improve our new business returns on equity, and in October 2003 and June 2004, we decreased our premium rates for term life insurance products. This decrease has led to an increase in term life insurance sales at the end of 2004. Our annualized first year premiums for term life insurance products increased by 42% from $19 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 to $27 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004, and we further decreased our premium rates for term life insurance in January 2005. We believe our recent price reductions, together with ongoing service and distribution support initiatives, will continue to lead to increased term life insurance sales over time. Long term care insurance. Total individual long term care insurance premiums for in force policies in the U.S. increased from approximately $2.4 billion in 1997 to $6.8 billion in 2004, according to LIMRA International. Industry wide sales of individual long term care insurance peaked in 2002 at approximately $1.0 billion and decreased by 7% in 2003 and 25% in 2004. We believe this decrease was due primarily to decisions by several providers to cease offering long term care insurance, to raise premiums on in force policies, and or to introduce new products with higher prices. These actions resulted in decreased purchases of long term care insurance products and have caused some distributors to reduce their sales focus on these products. In addition, we have been experiencing lower lapse rates than we originally anticipated on long term care insurance policies that we issued prior to the mid 1990s. This has adversely affected our overall claims experience on those policies. In the third quarter of 2003, we started selling our newest long term care insurance products in selected states. These products were priced to achieve our target returns on capital and to reflect new features and benefits, trends in lapse rates, interest rates, morbidity and adverse claims experience in certain higher risk policyholder classes. Our pricing strategy for these products, along with declines in overall industry sales, have contributed to lower sales in recent periods. Our annualized first year premiums for the long term care business 99 Table of Contents decreased by 33% from $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In late fourth quarter of 2004, we began selling these products in the majority of the remaining states, and we expect there may be a similar adverse impact on sales in those states, potentially resulting in uneven sales in our long term care business. We believe that our pricing strategy is appropriate and that over time, the long term care insurance market will continue to expand as the result of aging demographics, increasing healthcare and nursing care costs, the uncertainty regarding government programs that currently cover these costs and the increasing public awareness of the benefits of private long term care insurance. On January 27, 2005 the NAIC Capital Adequacy Task Force recommended a new formula that ties the calculation of risk based capital for long term care insurance more closely to claims than to collected premiums, which is the current practice. The new formula is subject to approval by the NAIC. If approved, the new formula may enable us to release capital temporarily from our long term care insurance business for use in other business lines in December 2005. Payment protection insurance. Our payment protection insurance business has expanded as a result of our strategy to enter additional markets in Continental Europe and Ireland and to develop new relationships with distributors in those markets. However, the margins of our payment protection business in the U.K. have decreased in recent years as a result of increased pricing pressure and greater competition from captive insurance arrangements by distributors that provide payment protection insurance directly to their customers. As a result, in the third quarter of 2003, we evaluated our contractual relationships with our payment protection insurance distributors against our targeted return thresholds and decided to terminate or not to renew certain relationships that we refer to as run off. In the aggregate, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, in our payment protection insurance business decreased by 31% from $2,175 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,501 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. However, excluding run off business, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, increased by 21% from $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,441 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although we expect the total revenue from our payment protection business to continue to decline over the next few years as our run off business diminishes, we believe this will not have a material impact on our operating earnings and will have a favorable effect on our returns as capital is released and redeployed into markets with potential for higher growth and returns. Annuities. The results of our Retirement Income and Investments segment are affected primarily by interest rate fluctuations and volatile equity markets, as discussed above under Overview Business trends and conditions General conditions and trends affecting our businesses. In addition, our competitive position within many of our distribution channels depends significantly upon product features, including our crediting rates on spread based products relative to our competitors, minimum guaranteed rates, surrender charge periods and agent commissions. We continually evaluate our competitive position based upon each of those features, and we make adjustments as appropriate to meet our target return thresholds. For example, our deposits in fixed annuities increased by 67% from $1,028 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 to $1,719 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of our expanded distribution relationships with financial intermediaries and a new fixed annuity product we introduced in 2004 that incorporates flexible product features. We believe that a gradual increase in market interest rates will have a favorable impact on consumer demand for these products. We also recently introduced the Income Distribution Series of guaranteed income annuity products and riders that provide the contractholder with a guaranteed minimum income stream and an opportunity to participate in market appreciation but reduce some of the risks to insurers that generally accompany traditional products with guaranteed minimum income benefits. Sales of these products increased by 82% from $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $258 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our new deposits in variable annuities decreased by 48% from $2,048 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1,075 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We believe this decline was primarily driven by a market shift to variable annuity products with certain guaranteed benefit features that we chose not to offer due to their risk profile. 100 Table of Contents Mortgage insurance. As discussed above under Overview Business trends and conditions General conditions and trends affecting our businesses, increasing interest rates in 2004 have contributed to a significant decrease in U.S. new mortgage insurance written. Our U.S. new insurance written also has been adversely affected by our actions in connection with our captive reinsurance arrangements. Starting in late 2003, we generally sought to exit or restructure a portion of our excess of loss risk sharing arrangements with premium cessions in excess of 25% to improve profitability. This resulted in a significant reduction in business from several of these lenders. We later re evaluated these relationships on a case by case basis, assessing various factors, including ceding terms, attachment points and quality of portfolios. As a result, we reinstated or restructured some of these arrangements in a form that we believe allows us to achieve acceptable returns. For the foregoing reasons, as well as the continued popularity of simultaneous second, or 80 10 10, loans as an alternative to private mortgage insurance, our U.S. new insurance written decreased by 58% from $67.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $28.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the significant U.S. refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 and the significant expansion of our international business in recent years, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 80% of our U.S. risk in force and 72% of our international risk in force had not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years, which are generally between the third and seventh year of the loan. We expect our loss experience on these loans will increase as policies continue to age. Our international mortgage insurance business has continued to expand and has had a favorable impact on our results of operations. International new insurance written increased by 32% from $39.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $51.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was driven by a larger mortgage origination market in Canada and increased account penetration in both Canada and Australia, as well as growth in new insurance written in Europe and favorable foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by a smaller mortgage origination market in Australia. We expect that the growth of our international mortgage insurance business will continue to contribute an increasing portion of this segments total revenues and profits. Separation from GE and related financial arrangements GE historically has provided a variety of products and services to us, and we have provided various products and services to GE. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a transition services agreement and various other agreements with GE that, together with a number of agreements that were in effect before the IPO, govern the relationship between GE and us. Services received from GE Support services and corporate overhead. GE historically has provided a variety of support services for our businesses, including: customer service, transaction processing and a variety of functional support services provided by an outsourcing provider in India that was wholly owned by GE until December 2004 and is now 40% owned by GE; employee benefit processing and payroll administration, including relocation, travel, credit card processing and related services; employee training programs, including access to GE training courses; insurance coverage under the GE insurance program; information systems, network and related services; leases for vehicles, equipment and facilities; and other financial advisory services such as tax consulting, capital markets services, research and development activities, and use of trademarks and licenses. We have reimbursed GE for the costs of providing these services to us. We paid GE a total of $65 million, $87 million and $74 million for these services for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 101 Table of Contents In addition, GE historically has allocated to us a share of its corporate overhead expenses for certain services provided to us, which are not specifically billed to us, including public relations, investor relations, treasury, and internal audit services. Our total expense for this allocation was $14 million, $50 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We have not reimbursed these amounts to GE, and have recorded them as a capital contribution in each year. Following the completion of the IPO, GE no longer allocates any of its corporate expenses to us. GE continues to provide us with many of the corporate services described above on a transitional basis, and we are arranging to procure other services pursuant to arrangements with third parties or through our own employees. In the aggregate, we expect that our total costs for procuring corporate services that previously had been provided by GE will not materially exceed the amounts we historically have paid to GE for these services, including GEs allocation to us for its corporate overhead. However, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental advertising, marketing, investor relations and legal entity transition expenses to establish a new brand identity. We also incurred compensation expense with respect to the establishment of our new equity plans. In addition, we have obtained direct access to a variety of third party products and services, including technology licenses, as a result of GEs relationships with those third parties. We have negotiated and are continuing to negotiate our own arrangements with third party providers for these products and services, and we do not believe these arrangements will result in materially increased costs in the aggregate. Investment management services. We have received and will continue to receive investment management services from GE Asset Management Incorporated, or GEAM, a subsidiary of GE, pursuant to agreements that were, with limited exceptions, amended in connection with the IPO. We also entered into new agreements with GE Asset Management Limited, or GEAML, an affiliate of GEAM, for investment management services in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Pursuant to these agreements, the fees charged by GEAM and GEAML are based on a percentage of the value of the assets under management. This percentage is established annually by agreement between us and GEAM or GEAML and is intended to reflect the cost to GEAM or GEAML of providing its services and, for the agreements with GEAML, a premium of 5%. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our aggregate costs for investment management and related administration services provided by GEAM and GEAML were approximately $33 million, $61 million and $39 million, respectively. Reinsurance transactions. In addition to our arrangements with UFLIC, we have entered into reinsurance transactions with affiliates of GE, principally Employers Reassurance Company and ERC Life Reinsurance Corporation (formerly an affiliate of GE), which we refer to collectively as ERC, under which we have reinsured some of the risks of our insurance policies on terms comparable to those we could obtain from third parties. We have paid premiums to these affiliates of $39 million, $56 million and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, in 2002, one of our subsidiaries entered into a life reinsurance agreement with an affiliated company, GE Pensions Limited, to reinsure 95% of our liabilities under certain life insurance policies. We have paid premiums to this affiliate of $100 million and $94 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This agreement was terminated as of December 31, 2003. Employee benefit plans. Historically, we have reimbursed GE for benefits it has provided to our employees under various employee benefit plans, including GEs retirement plan, retiree health and life insurance benefit plans, defined contribution savings plan and life and health insurance benefits through the GE benefit program. We incurred expenses associated with these plans of $108 million, $109 million and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. GE will continue to provide these benefits to our employees for so long as GE owns more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. See note 13 to our financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition to these expenses for which we have reimbursed GE, we have incurred expenses of $2 million, $9 million and $6 million for certain GE stock option and restricted stock unit grants for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As in the case of the allocation of corporate overhead, we have not reimbursed these amounts with respect to stock options and restricted stock units to GE. In connection with the IPO, we established our own equity compensation plans. See Equity plans below. 102 Table of Contents Services provided to GE We have provided various products and services to GE on terms comparable to those we provide to third parties and we expect to continue to provide many of these products and services to GE. In addition, in connection with the IPO, we entered into a series of arrangements with GE pursuant to which we will provide a variety of additional services to GE, including the arrangements discussed below. The following describes the principal impact of those service arrangements on our results of operations: Transition services relating to GE and GEFAHI businesses not acquired by us. We provide services to certain of GEs insurance businesses that we did not acquire. These services include finance, information systems, network services and regulatory support. We continue to provide these services and will do so for a minimum of two years and a maximum of three years, in most cases, following the IPO. For the two years following the completion of the IPO, GE generally may not terminate any of the services we provide. GE has agreed to pay us $40 million in equal quarterly installments during each of the first two years following the completion of the IPO for our provision of the transition services to GE. The charges for the transition services generally are intended to allow the providing company to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services, plus all out of pocket costs and expenses, generally without profit. Management consulting services. We have agreed to provide certain management consulting services to GE for a period of five years following the IPO. These services include delivering training, providing consultation and strategic advice with respect to actuarial, regulatory and other emerging issues, planning and participating in meetings with rating agencies and regulators, participating in government relations activities and various other activities. In consideration for these services, GE will pay us a fee of $1 million per month during the first four years following the completion of the IPO and $0.5 million per month during the fifth year. GE cannot terminate this arrangement before the expiration of the five year term. GIC investment administration services. We entered into three agreements with affiliates of GE, effective as of January 1, 2004, to manage a pool of municipal guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, issued by those affiliates. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to originate GIC liabilities and advise the GE affiliates regarding the investment, administration and management of their assets that support those liabilities. Under two of those agreements, we receive an administration fee of 0.165% per annum of the maximum program size for those GE affiliates, which is $15 billion. The agreements also provide for termination fees in the event of early termination at the option of either affiliate. Under a third agreement with another affiliate, we receive a management fee of 0.10% per annum of the book value of the investment contracts or similar securities issued by this affiliate after January 1, 2003, which was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2004. The fee we receive on the contracts issued by that affiliate before January 1, 2003 is based upon a pricing arrangement that varies depending upon the maturities of those contracts and that affiliates cost of capital. The book value of the contracts issued before January 1, 2003 was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 and is expected to generate a weighted average fee of approximately 0.35% in 2005. We also will receive reimbursement of our operating expenses under each of the agreements. The initial term of each of the three agreements will expire December 31, 2006, and unless terminated at the option of either party, each agreement automatically will renew on January 1 of each year for successive terms of one year. Institutional asset management services. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we offered a broad range of institutional asset management services to third parties. GEAM provided the portfolio management services for this business, and we provided marketing, sales and support services. We did not acquire the institutional asset management services business from GEFAHI, but we continue to provide services to GEAM and GEFAHI related to this asset management business, including client introduction services, asset retention services and compliance support. GEFAHI has agreed to pay us a fee of up to $10 million per year for four years following the completion of the IPO to provide these services. The fee will be determined based upon the level of third party assets under management managed by GEAM over the four year term. The agreement may not be terminated by GEAM or GEFAHI, except for non performance or in the event that we commence a similar institutional asset management business. 103 Table of Contents Additional arrangements with GE In addition to the arrangements described above pursuant to which we and GE will provide services to each other, we also entered into the following additional arrangements with GE: Tax Matters Agreement. As a consequence of our separation from GE, and our election jointly made with GE to treat that separation as an asset sale under section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to become entitled to additional tax deductions for periods after our corporate reorganization. We expect to realize tax savings from these deductions and have recorded our estimate of these tax savings on our statement of financial position as a $718 million reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities. We are obligated, pursuant to our Tax Matters Agreement with GE, to pay to GE, on an after tax basis, 80% of the amount of tax we are projected to save for each tax period as a result of these increased tax benefits, up to a maximum of $640 million. We have recorded the $389 million present value of this obligation to GE as our estimate of this liability in our statement of financial position. Since our initial estimates recorded at the time of the IPO, our estimate of the expected tax savings has increased significantly, while the present value of our obligation to GE has increased slightly. This is because (1) a portion of the future savings now exceeds the $640 million maximum payment to GE, (2) the discount rate increased from that estimated at the time of the IPO, and (3) the average life of the obligation increased. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we would also be required to pay to GE additional amounts in the event we realize certain other contingent benefits, or if we choose to defer certain payments and thereby incur interest on any such deferrals. To the extent that we never realize the anticipated tax savings because we have insufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (or because of a reduction in tax rates), we may, at our option, defer payments until 2029. These deferred payments would bear interest over the term of the deferral at an interest rate of 5.72% per annum (estimated, in accordance with the Tax Matters Agreement, to be our cost of funds as of the date of our initial public offering for a borrowing of like duration) from the time that we were scheduled to make the payments. In certain circumstances, we may realize tax savings later than projected in calculating the schedule of corresponding payments to GE pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, but our payment schedule to GE would not be changed. In these circumstances, we will remain obligated to pay amounts to GE even before we realize the corresponding tax savings, although we can choose to defer such payments. There are two categories of such circumstances. First, in certain limited instances the Tax Matters Agreement establishes binding factual assumptions pursuant to which we are scheduled to make payments to GE in advance of the time we anticipate realizing the corresponding tax savings. We estimate that the interest expense we will incur with respect to such advance payments over the entire life of the Tax Matters Agreement, if we choose to defer them, will be approximately $25 million. The second, broader category of these circumstances are those situations in which our actual tax savings are delayed beyond the time we currently project for any reason other than a change in the tax returns on which the section 338 sales are reported. In the case of either the first or second category, we may defer the scheduled payments to GE until we actually realize the corresponding tax savings or, alternatively, we may make the payments from sources other than the projected tax savings. Any deferred payments would bear interest until made at the rate of 5.72% per annum. The $329 million difference between the $718 million benefit we have recorded as the expected future tax savings and the $389 million liability to GE we have recorded is part of our net stockholders interest. These amounts reflect considered judgments and assessments as to the underlying facts and assumptions. However, if and to the extent our final section 338 tax savings exceed (or fall short of) the amount of tax savings we currently project, our additional paid in capital would increase (or decrease) accordingly. As our obligation to make payments under the Tax Matters Agreement accretes over time, we will record interest expense at a rate of 5.72% per annum. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, GE also is responsible for certain taxes of our legal entities, other than taxes in respect of the section 338 elections described above, resulting from the various transactions implemented in connection with our 104 Table of Contents separation from GE (other than the reinsurance with UFLIC). We record (or will record) these non recurring taxes as a current tax expense (or benefit) when incurred, and we record (or will record) GEs payment of the taxes (or receipt of the benefit) as an equity contribution (or dividend). UFLIC reinsurance arrangements. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, an indirect subsidiary of GE. Under the terms of the agreements governing these reinsurance transactions, we transferred to UFLIC assets equal to the policyholder liabilities related to the ceded blocks of business and recorded a reinsurance recoverable asset for the amount of the policyholder liabilities reinsured, except with respect to the in force liabilities for the variable annuity separate accounts, for which there is no asset transfer. We will continue to have a separate account liability in the amount of the policyholder liabilities related to the separate account assets which we did not transfer to UFLIC. We remain liable under these contracts and policies as the ceding insurer and, as a result, will continue to carry insurance reserve liabilities for the reinsured policies on our balance sheet. In connection with the Medicare supplement insurance assumed by us, UFLIC transferred to us cash and other investments, and we recorded a reinsurance liability, equal to the policyholder liabilities related to this assumed block of business. As of December 31, 2004, our total reinsurance recoverable for all our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC was $16.2 billion. The reinsurance transactions have the effect of transferring the financial results of the reinsured blocks of business (except for Medicare supplement insurance) from us to UFLIC and the Medicare supplement insurance block of business from UFLIC to us. With respect to the long term care insurance policies reinsured to UFLIC, we retained an interest in the future profitability of the block if it exceeds certain thresholds. We also are continuing to administer all the policies reinsured by UFLIC, and we will receive an expense allowance to reimburse us for the costs we incur to service these policies. Equity plans Prior to the IPO, our key employees participated in a number of GEs equity compensation plans. For grants issued prior to January 1, 2002, we recorded compensation expense related to our employees participation in those plans over the vesting period of the awards based upon their intrinsic value at the grant date. For grants issued after January 1, 2002, we recorded compensation expense for share based compensation awards over the vesting period of the awards based upon their fair value at the grant date in accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In connection with the IPO, we established our own equity compensation plans. Under these plans, unvested GE stock options, vested stock options held by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, GE stock appreciation rights and GE restricted stock units were canceled and converted into awards of our company, and we also granted new stock options in our company in connection with our separation from GE and the IPO. The GE stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units were converted based upon a ratio equal to the initial offering price of our common stock in the IPO ($19.50), divided by the weighted average stock price of GE common stock for the trading day immediately preceding the pricing date of the IPO ($30.52). The converted securities, if unvested, generally continue to vest over their original vesting periods. The unvested converted awards had approximately the same fair value at the date of the conversion as the GE awards that were replaced. We incurred compensation expense of $29 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and expect to incur expenses of $41 million and $31 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, for 2004 and prior awards to our employees under these plans. Branding costs We expect to incur aggregate expenses of approximately $35 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 on marketing, advertising and legal entity transition expenses, relating to the costs of establishing our new brand throughout our business, including with sales intermediaries, employees, investors and consumers. 105 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be particularly critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our ability to judge the effect of inherently uncertain matters on our financial results. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and our managements best estimates may require adjustment. Reserves. We calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders and contractholders based on actuarial assumptions and in accordance with industry practice and U.S. GAAP. Many factors can affect these reserves, including economic and social conditions, inflation, healthcare costs, changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Therefore, the reserves we establish are necessarily based on estimates, assumptions and our analysis of historical experience. Our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products. Our reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. Insurance reserves differ for long and short duration insurance policies and annuity contracts. Measurement of long duration insurance reserves (such as guaranteed renewable term life, whole life and long term care insurance policies) is based on approved actuarial methods, but necessarily includes assumptions about expenses, mortality, morbidity, lapse rates and future yield on related investments. Short duration contracts (such as payment protection insurance) are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that periods claims, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. Short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events. Estimates of mortgage insurance reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on notices of mortgage loan defaults and estimates of defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, using assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim. As is common accounting practice in the mortgage insurance industry and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, loss reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default. Deferred acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs, or DAC, represents costs which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts that are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. DAC is subsequently amortized to expense, over the lives of the underlying contracts, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits. The amortization of DAC for traditional long duration insurance products (including guaranteed renewable term life, life contingent structured settlements and immediate annuities and long term care insurance) is determined as a level proportion of premium based on commonly accepted actuarial methods and reasonable assumptions established when the contract or policy is issued about mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, expenses, and future yield on related investments. Amortization for annuity contracts without significant mortality risk and investment and universal life products is based on estimated gross profits and is adjusted as those estimates are revised. The DAC amortization methodology for our variable products (variable annuities and variable universal life insurance) includes a long term equity market average appreciation assumption of 8.5%. When actual returns vary from the expected 8.5%, we assume a reversion to this mean over a 3 to 7 year period, subject to the imposition of ceilings and floors. The assumed returns over this reversion period are limited to the 85th percentile of historical market performance. We regularly review all of these assumptions and periodically test DAC for recoverability. For deposit products, if the current present value of estimated future gross profits is less than the unamortized DAC for a line 106 Table of Contents of business, a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization. For other products, if the benefit reserves plus anticipated future premiums and interest earnings for a line of business are less than the current estimate of future benefits and expenses (including any unamortized DAC), a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization or for increased benefit reserves. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves. In recent years, the portion of estimated product margins required to amortize DAC and PVFP has increased in most lines of our business, with the most significant impact on investment products, primarily as the result of lower investment returns. Present value of future profits. In conjunction with the acquisition of a block of life insurance policies or investment contracts, a portion of the purchase price is assigned to the right to receive future gross profits arising from existing insurance and investment contracts. This intangible asset, called the present value of future profits, or PVFP, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. PVFP is amortized, net of accreted interest, in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC. We regularly review our assumptions and periodically test PVFP for recoverability in a manner similar to our treatment of DAC. Goodwill impairment. Goodwill resulting from acquisitions is tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge to income would be recorded. Valuation of investment securities. We obtain values for actively traded securities from external pricing services. For infrequently traded securities, we obtain quotes from brokers or we estimate values using internally developed pricing models. These models are based upon common valuation techniques and require us to make assumptions regarding credit quality, liquidity and other factors that affect estimated values. Impairment of investment securities. We regularly review investment securities for impairment in accordance with our impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security position is in an unrealized loss position, and for fixed maturities, whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent to hold the security until recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams, as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of GEAM and other third party managers, as required. We actively perform comprehensive market research, monitor market conditions and segment our investments by credit risk in order to minimize impairment risks. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Impairments of investment securities and note 6 to our financial statements. Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations The following table sets forth our historical and pro forma results of operations. The pro forma financial information reflects our historical results of operations as adjusted to reflect the various adjustments described under Item 6. Selected Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information. The pro forma financial information principally reflects the exclusion from our results of operations of the structured settlement, variable annuity and long term care insurance in force blocks that we ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions; the exclusion from our results of operations of certain businesses, including the Affinity segment, and other assets and liabilities of GEFAHI that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization; the inclusion in our results of operations of incremental interest expense associated with the consideration that we issued to GEFAHI in connection with our corporate reorganization, including $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock and the $550 million Contingent Note; and the issuance of $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. 107 Table of Contents Our historical results of operations include the results of operations of the Affinity segment and the blocks of business that we ceded to UFLIC through for all periods presented through May 24, 2004, the date of our corporate reorganization. Pro forma revenues and benefits and expenses (except interest expense) are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured blocks of business and the to the Affinity segment. Pro forma interest expense is higher than historical interest expense as the result of our revised capital structure following our corporate reorganization and the IPO. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 6,559 $ 6,707 $ 6,107 $ 6,388 Net investment income 3,648 4,051 3,979 3,160 Net realized investment gains 26 10 204 23 Policy fees and other income 824 915 939 664 Total revenues 11,057 11,683 11,229 10,235 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 4,804 5,270 4,640 4,340 Interest credited 1,432 1,624 1,645 1,319 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,812 1,916 1,808 1,657 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 1,154 1,351 1,221 1,052 Interest expense 217 140 124 243 Total benefits and expenses 9,419 10,301 9,438 8,611 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting change 1,638 1,382 1,791 1,624 Provision for income taxes 493 413 411 494 Net earnings from continuing operations before accounting change $ 1,145 $ 969 $ 1,380 $ 1,130 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Our premiums consist primarily of premiums earned on individual life, long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies, income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies and mortgage insurance policies. Premiums decreased $148 million, or 2%, to $6,559 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as the result of a $156 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $107 million decrease in our Protection segment, partially offset by an $84 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment and a $45 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investment segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in long term care insurance premiums as the result of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, as well as a decrease in payment protection insurance premiums as the result of the continued run off of low return books of business. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in international mortgage insurance premiums, attributable to the aging of our international in force block, which resulted in increased earned premiums from prior year new insurance written, offset in part by a decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums, attributable to decreased demand for mortgage insurance as the result of a smaller U.S. market for mortgage originations. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in premiums from life 108 Table of Contents contingent income annuities attributable to new distribution relationships in 2004, offset in part by a decrease in premiums from life contingent structured settlements attributable to our decision to write those contracts only when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Net investment income. Net investment income represents the income earned on our investments. Net investment income decreased $403 million, or 10%, to $3,648 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $4,051 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease in net investment income was primarily the result of a decrease in average invested assets, primarily due to the transfer of assets to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions, partially offset by new asset purchases. The decrease in net investment income was also the result of a decrease in weighted average investment yields to 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in weighted average investment yields was primarily attributable to purchases of new assets in an interest rate environment where current market yields are lower than existing portfolio yields. Net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains consist of gross realized investment gains and gross realized investment (losses), including charges related to impairments. Net realized investment gains increased $16 million to $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross realized gains and (losses) were $90 million and $(64) million, respectively. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $26 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($17 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the timber products, healthcare, consumer products industries ($6 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively). The equity securities impairments primarily related to mutual fund investments. The other investments impairments related to impairment of limited partnership investments. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross realized gains and (losses) were $473 million and $(463) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $43 million gain from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $224 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($126 million, $83 million and $15 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the transportation, mining and metals, utilities and energy and technology and communications industries ($36 million, $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively). In addition, $30 million of fixed maturities impairments were realized on asset backed securities. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($37 million and $46 million, respectively). The other investments impairments primarily related to impairment of limited partnership investments Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income consist primarily of cost of insurance and surrender charges assessed on universal life insurance policies, fees assessed against policyholder and contractholder account values, and commission income. Policy fees and other income decreased $91 million, or 10%, to $824 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of a $156 million decrease in our Affinity segment and a $12 million decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decreases were partially offset by a $46 million increase in our Corporate and Other segment, and a $28 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily the result of a decrease in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to lower refinancing activity in the U.S. The increase in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to a gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in commission income due to increased sales of third party products and fee income earned in connection with investment and administrative services related to a pool of municipal GICs issued by affiliates of GE, offset by a decrease in fee income attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. 109 Table of Contents Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves consist primarily of reserve activity related to current claims and future policy benefits on life, long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies, structured settlements and income annuities with life contingencies and claim costs incurred related to mortgage insurance products. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $466 million, or 9%, to $4,804 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $5,270 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $253 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, a $116 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $107 million decrease in our Protection segment and a $40 million decrease in our Corporate and Other segment, offset partially by a $50 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to a decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC and a reclassification of variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders, which were classified as underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, in 2003. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily related to a decrease in our payment protection insurance business attributable to the lower loss ratio in the payment protection insurance run off block. The decrease in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to lower litigation expenses and higher reserves at our Bermuda reinsurer. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in paid claims as well as an increase in loans in default associated with higher insurance in force in our international mortgage insurance business. Interest credited. Interest credited represents interest credited on behalf of policyholder and contractholder general account balances. Interest credited decreased $192 million, or 12%, to $1,432 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $189 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment that was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest credited associated with the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease in interest credited was also the result of lower interest credited on institutional products due to a decrease in the average size of the in force block. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, represent costs and expenses related to the acquisition and ongoing maintenance of insurance and investment contracts, including commissions, policy issue expenses and other underwriting and general operating costs. These costs and expenses are net of amounts that are capitalized and deferred, which are primarily costs and expenses which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts, such as first year commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and other policy issue expenses. These expenses decreased $104 million, or 5%, to $1,812 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $1,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as the result of a $121 million decrease in our Affinity segment, a $37 million decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment and a $32 million decrease in our Corporate and Other Segment, partially offset by a $75 million increase in our Protection segment and a $11 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenses primarily from lower underwriting expenses due to a decline in refinancing activity in the U.S., lower administrative costs and a decrease in the provision for indemnity liabilities related to a decline in mortgage loan origination. The decrease in our Corporate and Other segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in allocated expenses from GE as the result of our corporate reorganization and lower litigation expenses. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to an increase in our payment protection insurance business related primarily to an increase in commissions and other compensation arrangements in our run off block, partially offset by decreased legal fees in our life insurance business following an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit in 2003 and lower other expenses and a decrease in the long term care business primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in commission and other expenses incurred in our fee based products primarily due to increased sales. 110 Table of Contents Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of acquisition costs that are capitalized and PVFP. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $197 million, or 15%, to $1,154 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $132 million decrease in our Protection segment, a $58 million decrease in our Affinity segment, and a $20 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, partially offset by a $14 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in payment protection insurance due to our decision not to renew certain distribution relationships, partially offset by the impact of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease in our Affinity segment relates to the exclusion of this segment as a result of our corporate reorganization. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The increase in the Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization reflecting higher than expected early year margins on recently written policies in the U.S. and the continued growth of our international business. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $77 million, or 55%, to $217 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization, as well as the full year contribution of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and interest paid on non recourse funding obligations issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $80 million, or 19%, to $493 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $413 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate increased to 30.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to the loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE, a decrease in benefits related to dividends received, and favorable examination developments in 2003, which did not recur in 2004, offset in part by tax benefits recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization. Net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings from continuing operations increased by $176 million, or 18%, to $1,145 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations reflects increases in segment net earnings in each of our segments, except for our Affinity segment, whose net earnings decreased as a result of its exclusion as a result of our corporate reorganization. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $600 million, or 10%, to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6,107 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $500 million increase in our Protection segment, a $58 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment, and a $39 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to increases in payment protection insurance premiums as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates and growth of the in force block as well as growth in long term care insurance premiums. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in life contingent structured settlement premiums, offset in part by a decrease in life contingent income annuities. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to an increase in international mortgage insurance premiums, offset in part by a decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $72 million, or 2%, to $4,051 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $3,979 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in net investment income was primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in weighted average investment yields, primarily attributable to investments in the U.S., to 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002. 111 Table of Contents Net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains decreased $194 million to $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, gross realized gains and (losses) were $473 million and $(463) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2003 included a $43 million gain from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $224 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($126 million, $83 million and $15 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the transportation, mining and metals, utilities and energy and technology and communications industries ($36 million, $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively). In addition, $30 million of fixed maturities impairments were realized on asset backed securities. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($37 million and $46 million, respectively). The other investments impairments primarily related to impairment of limited partnership investments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, gross realized gains and (losses) were $790 million and $(586) million, respectively. The realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2002 included $29 million from a securitization of certain financial assets. Realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2002 included $343 million of impairments. These impairments were attributable to fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments ($193 million, $133 million and $17 million, respectively). The fixed maturities impairments primarily related to securities issued by companies in the technology and communications and airline industries ($131 million and $27 million, respectively). The technology and communication industry impairments include $83 million related to securities issued by WorldCom Inc. and its affiliates. The equity securities impairments related to mutual fund and common stock investments ($81 million and $52 million, respectively). The other investments impairments are related to impairment of limited partnership and other private equity investments. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $24 million to $915 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $939 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $25 million decrease in our Protection segment and an $11 million decrease in our Affinity segment, partially offset by a $10 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The decrease in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business. The decrease in our Affinity segment was primarily attributable to the decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to higher contract underwriting fees related to increased refinancing activity in the U.S. and higher fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $630 million, or 14%, to $5,270 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $4,640 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $367 million increase in our Protection segment, a $117 million increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment and a $69 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to an increase in changes in policy reserves for long term care insurance, payment protection insurance and life insurance. The increase in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to an increase in changes in policy reserves for structured settlements. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to favorable loss development on prior year reserves. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $21 million, or 1%, to $1,624 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,645 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $24 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment that was primarily attributable to lower credited rates on GICs and funding agreements, offset in part by an increase in interest credited resulting from more variable annuity policyholders selecting the fixed account option on their contracts, on which we credit interest. The decrease in interest credited was also the result of a reduction in our weighted average crediting rates to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002. 112 Table of Contents Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, increased $108 million, or 6%, to $1,916 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,808 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $89 million increase in our Protection segment, a $66 million increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment, partially offset by a $68 million decrease in our Affinity segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The increase in our Mortgage Insurance segment was primarily attributable to higher expenses associated with increased refinancing activity in the U.S., continued investment in our international mortgage insurance business and higher indemnity liabilities for U.S. contract underwriting claims, which are included as other liabilities in our statement of financial position. U.S contract underwriting indemnification claims arise out of our contract underwriting agreements, pursuant to which we agree to indemnify lenders against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors during the underwriting process. These claims are classified in this line item (and not in Benefits and other changes in policy reserves) because they do not relate to insured events. Our indemnification liabilities related to U.S. contract underwriting claims increased as the result of our updating the assumptions we used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans underwritten due to significant refinancing activity. The decrease in our Affinity segment was primarily attributable to cost saving initiatives that reduced compensation and benefits and other general expenses. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization increased $130 million, or 11%, to $1,351 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,221 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $155 million increase in our Protection segment, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. The increase in our Protection segment was primarily attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The decrease in our Retirement Income and Investments segment was primarily attributable to the impact of additional amortization in 2002 due to lower equity valuations of assets in our variable annuity separate accounts. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $16 million, or 13%, to $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $27 million of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003, and $3 million of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, supporting certain term life insurance policies. These increases were partially offset by a $14 million decrease in interest expense that was primarily the result of lower average short term borrowings and long term borrowings. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $2 million to $413 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a $152 million decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 that was attributable to a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to the treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders on life insurance contracts, partially offset by dividend received deduction benefits realized in 2003. Excluding the effect of the settlement, our effective tax rate would have been 29.9% and 31.4% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net earnings from continuing operations. Net earnings from continuing operations decreased by $411 million, or 30%, to $969 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,380 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in net realized investment gains and the impact of a favorable settlement with the IRS in 2002. The decline in net earnings from continuing operations reflects decreases in segment net earnings in our Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, Mortgage Insurance and Corporate and Other segments, partially offset by increased segment net earnings in our Affinity segment. 113 Table of Contents Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations by Segment Set forth below is historical financial information for each of our operating segments (Protection, Retirement Income and Investments and Mortgage Insurance), together with our Corporate and Other segment and the Affinity segment. Set forth below also is pro forma financial information for our Protection, Retirement Income and Investments and Corporate and Other segments. There were no pro forma adjustments to the results of operations of our Mortgage Insurance segment, and pro forma financial information is not provided for the Affinity segment because we did not acquire that segment from GEFAHI. All pro forma segment information is prepared on the same basis as the segment information presented in our unaudited financial statements. Management regularly reviews the performance of each of our operating segments based on the after tax net earnings (loss) of the segment, which excludes: (1) net realized investment gains (losses), (2) most of our interest and other financing expenses, (3) amounts reserved for the settlement in principle of the class action litigation relating to sales practices in our life insurance business, and (4) advertising and marketing costs and severance and restructuring charges. Although these excluded items are significant to our consolidated financial performance, we believe that the presentation of segment net earnings (loss) enhances our understanding and assessment of the results of operations of our operating segments by highlighting net earnings (loss) attributable to the normal, recurring operations of our business. However, segment net earnings (loss) is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Historical Pro forma As of or for the yearsended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues by segment: Protection $ 6,064 $ 6,143 $ 5,605 $ 5,935 Retirement Income and Investments 3,361 3,803 3,756 2,891 Mortgage Insurance 1,090 982 946 1,090 Affinity 218 566 588 Corporate and Other 324 189 334 319 Total revenues $ 11,057 $ 11,683 $ 11,229 $ 10,235 Segment net earnings (loss) from continuing operations: Protection $ 528 $ 487 $ 554 $ 527 Retirement Income and Investments 153 151 186 148 Mortgage Insurance 426 369 451 426 Affinity (14 ) 16 (3 ) Corporate and Other 52 (54 ) 192 29 Total segment net earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ 1,145 $ 969 $ 1,380 $ 1,130 Total assets by segment (as of the period ended): Protection $ 31,806 $ 29,254 Retirement Income and Investments 56,610 55,614 Mortgage Insurance 6,428 6,110 Affinity 2,315 Corporate and Other 9,034 10,138 Total assets $ 103,878 $ 103,431 114 Table of Contents Protection segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Protection segment. Prior to our corporate reorganization, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions in which we ceded to UFLIC a block of long term care insurance policies that we reinsured from Travelers in 2000, and we assumed from UFLIC in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance policies. We ceded the Travelers long term care block to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore its results are not included in our historical results after that date. Similarly, we assumed the Medicare supplement blocks from UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore their results are included in our historical results after that date. As a result of the foregoing, our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The pro forma earnings information below reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions as if they had been effective as of January 1, 2004. There were no pro forma adjustments to interest credited or interest expense because the long term care insurance policies we ceded to UFLIC, and the Medicare supplement insurance policies UFLIC ceded to us, in connection with the reinsurance transactions do not generate such fees, interest credited or interest expense. Pro forma revenues and benefits and expenses are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured block of long term care insurance. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 4,481 $ 4,588 $ 4,088 $ 4,398 Net investment income 1,224 1,199 1,136 1,178 Policy fees and other income 359 356 381 359 Total revenues 6,064 6,143 5,605 5,935 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 2,890 2,997 2,630 2,788 Interest credited 362 365 362 362 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 1,094 1,019 930 1,077 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 869 1,001 846 861 Interest expense 15 3 15 Total benefits and expenses 5,230 5,385 4,768 5,103 Earnings before income taxes 834 758 837 832 Provision for income taxes 306 271 283 305 Segment net earnings $ 528 $ 487 $ 554 $ 527 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums decreased $107 million, or 2%, to $4,481 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $4,588 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $102 million decrease in long term care insurance premiums, consisting of a $124 million decrease attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by a $22 million increase in premiums associated with the growth of the in force block. The decrease was also the result of a $81 million decrease in payment protection insurance premiums, consisting of a $231 million decrease on a constant currency basis, net of a $150 million increase attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The $231 million decrease consisted of a $393 million decrease in premiums in our run off block, offset by a $162 million increase in our continuing business 115 Table of Contents due to new distribution relationships and the growth of consumer lending in Continental Europe. These decreases were offset in part by a $61 million increase in life insurance premiums that was primarily attributable to growth of the term life insurance in force block. The decreases were also offset in part by a $15 million increase in group life and health insurance premiums attributable to growth of the in force block that was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of non medical products as the result of enhancements in our life insurance and disability product offerings and the expansion of our dental network. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $25 million, or 2%, to $1,224 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,199 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase, which included $13 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was primarily the result of an increase in average invested assets, offset in part by declining yields on investments and by a decrease in invested capital allocated to this segment in preparation for our corporate reorganization and initial public offering. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $3 million, or 1%, to $359 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $13 million increase in our life insurance business primarily attributable to an increase in policy fees and other income in our universal life insurance business. This increase was partially offset by a $9 million decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher lapse rates in 2004. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $107 million, or 4%, to $2,890 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $2,997 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $113 million decrease in our payment protection insurance business attributable to the lower loss ratio in the payment protection insurance run off block, $27 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was also attributable to a $85 million decrease in long term care benefits and other changes in policy reserves, consisting of a $150 million decrease primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by a $65 million increase primarily attributable to increased reserves and benefit payments resulting from the normal, expected increases in claims volume associated with the aging and continued growth of the long term care in force block. The decrease was partially offset by a $71 million increase in our life insurance business attributable to growth of the in force block and less favorable claim experience compared to 2003, as well as a $19 million increase in our group life and health insurance business primarily attributable to growth in the in force block and loss ratios that were more in line with expectations after favorable results in 2003. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $3 million, or 1%, to $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased crediting rates for universal life insurance policies, offset in part by increased policyholder account balances on corporate owned life insurance policies. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals increased $75 million, or 7%, to $1,094 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to an $116 million increase in our payment protection insurance business related primarily to an increase in commissions and other compensation arrangements in our run off block. This increase was partially offset by a $27 million decrease in our life insurance business primarily attributable to decreased legal fees following the agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit in 2003 and lower other expenses. The increase was also partially offset by an $18 million decrease in our long term care insurance business primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $132 million, or 13%, to $869 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $184 million decrease 116 Table of Contents in payment protection insurance due to our decision not to renew certain distribution relationships, partially offset by an increase of $69 million due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was also partially attributable to a $20 million decrease in our life insurance business due to lower 2004 lapses in our term life insurance block and lower amortization on our universal life insurance block due to additional investment income related to bond calls and favorable universal life insurance claims experience, both of which resulted in accelerated amortization in 2003 and did not recur in 2004. Long term care amortization decreased $3 million primarily as a result of a $14 million decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, partially offset by an increase in our long term care business due to growth in the in force block. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $12 million to $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2004, supporting certain term life insurance policies. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $35 million, or 13%, to $306 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 36.7% and 35.8% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to a loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased by $41 million, or 8%, to $528 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net earnings primarily reflects increases in net earnings in our life, payment protection and long term care insurance businesses, offset in part by a decrease in net earnings in our group life and health insurance business. The increase in life insurance was primarily attributable to growth of the in force block and lower legal expenses following the agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit. The increase in payment protection insurance was primarily attributable to $10 million in one time charges related to employee benefit costs, as well as an $8 million increase due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase due to growth in our continuing business, partially offset by the loss of certain foreign tax benefits. The increase in our long term care insurance business was primarily attributable to the growth of the block, partially offset by a loss of earnings on invested capital attributable to a reallocation of capital to our Corporate and Other segment and decreased earnings as a result of the reinsurance transactions. The decrease in our group life and health insurance business was attributable to loss experience that was more in line with expectations after favorable results in 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $500 million, or 12%, to $4,588 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $4,088 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $265 million increase in payment protection insurance premiums, with $155 million of that increase attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates and $110 million of that increase attributable to growth of the in force block. The increase was also the result of a $232 million increase in long term care insurance premiums that was primarily attributable to growth of the in force block. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $63 million, or 6%, to $1,199 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,136 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in invested assets, offset in part by declining yields on investments in the lower interest rate environment. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $25 million, or 7%, to $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $13 million decrease in administrative fees from our group life and health insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher lapse rates. 117 Table of Contents Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $367 million, or 14%, to $2,997 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,630 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $267 million increase in changes in reserves and benefit payments resulting from the normal, expected increases in claims volume associated with the aging of the long term care insurance in force block. The increase was also the result of a $69 million increase in changes in policy reserves attributable to growth of the payment protection insurance in force block, of which $34 million was attributable to a lower amount of favorable loss development on prior year reserves, and a $38 million increase in life insurance reserves. Interest credited. Interest credited increased $3 million, or 1%, to $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of increased policyholder account balances on corporate owned life insurance policies, offset in part by decreased crediting rates for universal life insurance policies. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals increased $89 million, or 10%, to $1,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $930 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an $83 million increase attributable to growth in the payment protection insurance in force block that was primarily associated with an increase in net commission expense. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $155 million, or 18%, to $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $846 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $96 million increase resulting from growth of the payment protection insurance in force block. The increase was also the result of a $33 million increase primarily attributable to additional investment income due to early bond calls within the universal life insurance investment portfolio and to favorable universal life insurance claims experience, both of which accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. In addition, $19 million of the increase was the result of the impact of the amortization of PVFP in 2002 for the block of long term care insurance reinsured from Travelers. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of interest paid on non recourse funding obligations, issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, supporting certain term life insurance policies. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $12 million, or 4%, to $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $283 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a decrease in certain foreign tax loss and dividend benefits. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased by $67 million, or 12%, to $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $554 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in segment net earnings primarily reflects decreases in net earnings for life, payment protection and group life and health insurance products, offset in part by increases in net earnings for long term care insurance products. The decrease in life insurance was primarily attributable to an increase in life insurance reserves, as well as accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles related to additional investment income resulting from early bond calls and favorable claims experience. The decrease in payment protection insurance was primarily attributable to higher underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, and the impact of the recognition in 2002 of certain foreign tax loss benefits. The decrease in group life and health insurance was primarily attributable to lower administration fees due to higher lapse rates. The increase in long term care insurance was primarily attributable to growth in the in force blocks. 118 Table of Contents Retirement Income and Investments segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Retirement Income and Investments segment. Prior to our corporate reorganization, we entered into several significant reinsurance transactions in which we ceded to UFLIC all of our in force structured settlements contracts and substantially all of our in force variable annuity contracts. We ceded these blocks of business to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004, and therefore their results are not included in our historical results after that date. As a result of the foregoing, our historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are not comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The pro forma earnings information below reflects adjustments to record the effects of the reinsurance transactions as if they had been effective as of January 1, 2004. Pro forma revenues (except premiums) and benefits and expenses are lower than our historical revenues and benefits and expenses primarily as the results of the exclusion of revenues and expenses related to the reinsured block of long term care insurance. There were no pro forma adjustments to premiums because the structured settlements we ceded are single premium products and do not have renewal premiums, and the variable annuity products we ceded are deposit contracts and their deposits are not recorded as premiums. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 1,094 $ 1,049 $ 991 $ 1,094 Net investment income 1,996 2,511 2,522 1,582 Policy fees and other income 271 243 243 215 Total revenues 3,361 3,803 3,756 2,891 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 1,633 1,886 1,769 1,352 Interest credited 1,070 1,259 1,283 957 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 250 239 221 229 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 170 190 210 122 Interest expense 1 1 Total benefits and expenses 3,124 3,574 3,483 2,661 Earnings before income taxes 237 229 273 230 Provision for income taxes 84 78 87 82 Segment net earnings $ 153 $ 151 $ 186 $ 148 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums increased $45 million, or 4%, to $1,094 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $68 million increase in premiums for life contingent income annuities that was primarily attributable to new distribution relationships in 2004. The increase was partially offset by a $23 million decrease in premiums for life contingent structured settlements that was primarily attributable to our decision to write those contracts only when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $515 million, or 21%, to $1,996 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of a decrease in average invested assets, primarily associated with assets transferred to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions, partially offset by new asset purchases. The decrease in net investment income also was the result of declining yields on investments. 119 Table of Contents Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $28 million, or 12%, to $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily attributable to a $38 million increase in commission income due to increased sales of third party products. The increase was also attributable to $34 million of fee income earned pursuant to new arrangements we entered into, effective as of January 1, 2004, to provide investment and administrative services related to a pool of municipal GICs issued by affiliates of GE. The increase was also attributable to a $10 million increase in fee income attributable to increased assets under management and a $10 million increase in asset management service fees. These increases were partially offset by a $62 million decrease in fee income primarily attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $253 million, or 13%, to $1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $341 million decrease related to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease was also partially attributable to a $34 million reclassification in variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders, which were classified as underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, in 2003. This reclassification was the result of the adoption of SOP 03 1 on January 1, 2004. The decrease was partially offset by a $68 million increase in reserves relating to life contingent income annuities and a $17 million increase related to favorable mortality on income annuities in 2003 which did not recur in 2004. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a one time charge of $49 million, $41 million of which was recorded in benefits and other changes in policy reserves. This charge related to a small run off block of equity indexed annuities and resulted from an adjustment of reserving processes. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $189 million, or 15%, to $1,070 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $1,259 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $172 million decrease in interest credited as the result of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. This decrease was also the result of a $16 million decrease relating to lower interest credited on institutional products due to a decrease in the average size of the in force block, as well as lower average interest crediting rates. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals, increased by $11 million, or 5%, to $250 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $32 million in commission and other expenses incurred in our fee based products primarily due to increased sales. The increase was also the result of the reclassification of $33 million of variable annuity sales inducements paid to contractholders which were classified as deferred acquisition costs in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a $45 million decrease in expenses associated with blocks of business ceded as part of the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC and an $7 million decrease in guarantee fund assessments. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $20 million, or 11%, to $170 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $33 million decrease attributable to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC. The decrease was partially offset by $8 million of accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs associated with variable life insurance. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $6 million, or 8%, to $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate increased to 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of the impact of higher dividends received deduction benefits related to separate account annuity products in 2003. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased $2 million, or 1%, to $153 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result 120 Table of Contents of lower expenses due primarily to the reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, offset by declining yields on invested assets. The increase in segment net earnings also was attributable to an increase in fees received under new contracts with GE to manage its municipal GIC business, as well as growth in our asset management businesses, growth in assets under management overall, and improved spreads, offset by a one time charge of $32 million (post tax) related to an adjustment of reserving processes related to a small run off block of equity indexed annuities. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $58 million, or 6%, to $1,049 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $991 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $92 million increase in premiums for life contingent structured settlements that was attributable to higher sales of this product. This increase was offset in part by a $31 million decrease in premiums for life contingent income annuities that was primarily attributable to lower sales of this product resulting from a reduction of crediting and payout rates in 2003 in the lower interest rate environment. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $11 million to $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of declining yields on investments, which was offset in part by an increase in invested assets. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income were unchanged at $243 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $117 million, or 7%, to $1,886 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,769 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $107 million increase in changes in policy reserves for structured settlements attributable to higher sales of this product. Interest credited. Interest credited decreased $24 million, or 2%, to $1,259 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $1,283 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower credited rates on GICs and funding agreements attributable to the lower interest rate environment, offset in part by an increase in interest credited attributable to more variable annuity policyholders selecting the fixed account option on their contracts, on which we credit interest. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased by $18 million, or 8%, to $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in general operating expenses, offset in part by an increase in deferrals of acquisition costs resulting from increased sales of variable annuities with bonus features, for which a portion of the benefit expense is deferred and amortized over the life of the product. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $20 million, or 10%, to $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the impact of a $26 million increase in additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2002 that was primarily attributable to lower equity valuations of assets in our variable annuity separate accounts. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $9 million, or 10%, to $78 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of the impact of higher dividends received deduction benefits related to separate account annuity products in 2002. 121 Table of Contents Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased $35 million, or 19%, to $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease in segment net earnings was primarily the result of lower policy fees and other income and declining yields on invested assets. The decrease in segment net earnings reflects decreases in net earnings for structured settlement, fixed annuity and GIC products and an increase in net earnings for variable annuity products. The decrease in structured settlements and GICs was primarily attributable to lower reinvestment rates. The decrease in fixed annuities was primarily attributable to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The increase in variable annuities was primarily attributable to tax benefits resulting from higher dividend deductions on our separate accounts. Mortgage Insurance segment The following table sets forth the historical results of operations relating to our Mortgage Insurance segment. The Mortgage Insurance segments results of operations are not affected by any of the pro forma adjustments. Years ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 800 $ 716 $ 677 Net investment income 254 218 231 Policy fees and other income 36 48 38 Total revenues 1,090 982 946 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 165 115 46 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 262 299 233 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 51 37 39 Total benefits and expenses 478 451 318 Earnings before income taxes 612 531 628 Provision for income taxes 186 162 177 Segment net earnings $ 426 $ 369 $ 451 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums increased $84 million, or 12%, to $800 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $125 million increase in premiums in our international mortgage insurance business, $35 million of which was attributable to favorable foreign exchange rates. The increase also was partially attributable to the aging of our international in force block, which resulted in increased earned premiums from prior year new insurance written. The increase in international premiums was partially offset by a $41 million decrease in our U.S. mortgage insurance premiums. This decrease in U.S. mortgage insurance premiums was primarily the result of the decline in our in force block due to decreased demand for mortgage insurance as the result of a smaller market for mortgage originations, as well as a reduction in business from some mortgage lenders following our actions to restructure our captive reinsurance arrangements with premium risk cessions in excess of 25%. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $36 million, or 17%, to $254 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $32 million increase in investment income in our international business, $13 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates, related to the growth in invested assets. Investment income in 122 Table of Contents our U.S. mortgage insurance business increased $4 million due to increasing yields on invested assets. As discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources, our U.S. mortgage insurance business paid a $700 million dividend to our parent holding company in December 2004. This dividend reduced the invested assets in our U.S. mortgage insurance business at the end of 2004. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income decreased $12 million, or 25%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of a $19 million decrease in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to lower refinancing activity in the U.S. This decrease was offset in part by a $7 million increase in fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $50 million, or 43%, to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of a $28 million increase in U.S. paid losses and a $22 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in claims and loans in default associated with higher insurance in force in our international mortgage insurance business, $4 million of which was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, decreased $37 million, or 12%, to $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $299 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $54 million decrease in expenses primarily attributable to lower underwriting expenses due to a decline in refinancing activity in the U.S. and lower administrative costs, and a $17 million decrease in the provision for indemnity liabilities related to a decline in mortgage loan origination primarily attributable to decreased mortgage refinancing activity. These declines were offset in part by a $34 million increase in expenses to support the expansion of our international mortgage insurance business, $8 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $14 million, or 38%, to $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was partially attributable to a $6 million increase in mortgage insurance amortization in the U.S. primarily due to accelerated amortization reflecting higher than expected early year margins on recently written policies. The increase was also attributable to an $8 million increase in international insurance amortization due primarily to the continued growth of our international business, $2 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $24 million, or 15%, to $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 30.4% and 30.5% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes and an increase in the benefit of tax exempt investment income, offset by the loss of foreign tax benefits as a result of the separation from GE. Our Mortgage Insurance segments effective tax rate is below the statutory rate primarily as a result of tax exempt investment income. Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings increased $57 million, or 15%, to $426 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase in segment net earnings was primarily attributable to a $58 million increase in net earnings attributable to continued growth in our international mortgage insurance business, $23 million of which was due to favorable foreign exchange rates. The relatively constant net earnings in our U.S. mortgage insurance business were primarily attributable to lower expenses, offset by a continued decrease in the in force block and an increase in our paid claims. 123 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $39 million, or 6%, to $716 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $677 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of an $88 million increase in premiums in our international mortgage insurance business, $24 million of which was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. This increase in international premiums was offset in part by a $26 million decrease in premiums in our U.S. mortgage insurance business that was primarily attributable to higher premiums ceded in captive reinsurance transactions and a $23 million decrease in premiums that was primarily attributable to lower persistency resulting from increased refinancing activity. Net investment income. Net investment income decreased $13 million, or 6%, to $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $42 million decrease in net investment income that was primarily attributable to a decrease in invested assets resulting from the payment of dividends by the U.S. mortgage insurance business to our holding company. The decrease was also the result of declining yields on investments. These decreases were offset in part by a $29 million increase in net investment income resulting from additional invested assets in our international mortgage insurance business, $10 million of which was due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $10 million, or 26%, to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $5 million increase in fees for contract underwriting services attributable to higher refinancing activity in the U.S. and a $5 million increase in fees from increased volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $69 million, or 150%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $60 million increase primarily attributable to a lower amount of favorable loss development on prior year reserves and a $9 million increase in paid claims on U.S. flow mortgage insurance offset in part by a $4 million decrease primarily attributable to favorable loss development on U.S. bulk mortgage insurance, and a $4 million increase primarily attributable to an increase in loans in default associated with higher insurance in force levels in our international mortgage insurance business. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased $66 million, or 28%, to $299 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was the result of a $37 million increase in expenses that was primarily attributable to a significant increase in underwriting volume associated with refinancing activity in the U.S., an $11 million increase attributable to higher indemnity liabilities for U.S. contract underwriting claims as the result of updating of the assumptions we used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans underwritten due to significant refinancing activity and an $18 million increase attributable to continued investment in our international mortgage insurance business. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $2 million, or 5%, to $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the amortization of a lower amount of U.S. deferred expenses, offset by the higher volume in our international mortgage insurance business. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $15 million, or 8%, to $162 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate increased to 30.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of a greater proportion of foreign income taxed at a higher rate than in the U.S. Our Mortgage Insurance segments effective tax rate is significantly below the statutory rate primarily as the result of tax exempt investment income. 124 Table of Contents Segment net earnings. Segment net earnings decreased $82 million, or 18%, to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $451 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of a $141 million decrease in U.S. net earnings, offset in part by a $59 million increase in international net earnings. The decrease in U.S. net earnings was primarily attributable to greater losses from less favorable loss development on prior year reserves, decreases in premiums from increased ceding and lower persistency, and increases in underwriting expenses from refinancing activity and contract underwriting indemnification liabilities as the result of our updating the assumptions used to calculate these indemnity liabilities to reflect recent underwriting experience and increased volume. The increase in international net earnings was primarily the result of growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Affinity segment The following table sets forth the historical results of operations relating to the Affinity segment. Because we did not acquire any of the Affinity segment businesses from GEFAHI in our corporate reorganization, this segments results of operations are included in our results of operations only for periods through May 24, 2004 and are not included in our pro forma financial information. Years ended December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 88 $ 244 $ 247 Net investment income 26 62 70 Policy fees and other income 104 260 271 Total revenues 218 566 588 Benefits and expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 80 196 180 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 123 244 312 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 47 105 116 Total benefits and expenses 250 545 608 Earnings (loss) before income taxes (32 ) 21 (20 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (18 ) 5 (17 ) Segment net earnings (loss) $ (14 ) $ 16 $ (3 ) Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenues, benefits and expenses, provision (benefit) for income taxes and segment net earnings for the Affinity segment decreased because the Affinity segments results are not included in our results of operations for periods after May 24, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Total revenues. Total revenues decreased $22 million, or 4%, to $566 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $588 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of lower premiums and other income attributable to our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in premiums attributable to a reinsurance transaction in which certain premiums were ceded to us by the purchaser of a discontinued operation. Total benefits and expenses. Total benefits and expenses decreased $63 million, or 10%, to $545 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $608 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships and implement cost savings initiatives that reduced compensation and benefits, as well as other general expenses. Our decision to discontinue certain products and distribution relationships and implement cost savings initiatives also reduced 125 Table of Contents our deferrable expenses, resulting in a decrease in amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in benefits and expenses attributable to a reinsurance transaction in which certain benefits and expenses were ceded to us by the purchaser of a discontinued operation. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes increased $22 million to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(17) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increased provision was the result of a foreign loss valuation allowance. Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) increased $19 million to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(3) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of our discontinuation of products and distribution relationships that did not meet our target return thresholds and reductions of compensation and benefit expenses and other general expenses resulting from cost savings initiatives. Corporate and Other segment The following table sets forth the historical and pro forma results of operations relating to our Corporate and Other segment. There were no pro forma adjustments to premiums or policy fees and other income because there are no premiums or policy fees and other income in the Corporate and Other segment that were ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions. Pro forma net investment income is lower than our historical net investment income primarily as a result of a decrease attributable to reduced net investment income related to the $1.836 billion capital contribution that we made to UFLIC in connection with our corporate reorganization, offset in part by an increase attributable to net investment income earned on excess surplus assets that were transferred from the Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments to the Corporate and Other segment in 2004. Pro forma revenues are lower than our historical revenues primarily as a result of the adjustments to net investment income as described above, as well as the exclusion from our results of operations of net realized investment gains (losses) related to the long term care insurance, structured settlement and variable annuity blocks we ceded to UFLIC in connection with the reinsurance transactions and net realized investment gains (losses) related to the Affinity segment. Pro forma expenses are higher than our historical expenses primarily as a result of the interest expense attributable to our debt structure following the IPO, including the offerings of senior notes and commercial paper. Historical Pro forma Years ended December 31, Year endedDecember 31, 2004 (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues: Premiums $ 96 $ 110 $ 104 $ 96 Net investment income 148 61 20 146 Net realized investment gains 26 10 204 23 Policy fees and other income 54 8 6 54 Total revenues 324 189 334 319 Expenses: Benefits and other changes in policy reserves 36 76 15 35 Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses, net of deferrals 83 115 112 89 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles 17 18 10 18 Interest expense 201 137 124 227 Total expenses 337 346 261 369 Earnings (loss) before income taxes (13 ) (157 ) 73 (50 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (65 ) (103 ) (119 ) (79 ) Segment net earnings (loss) $ 52 $ (54 ) $ 192 $ 29 126 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Premiums. Premiums decreased $14 million, or 13%, to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased premiums from our Bermuda reinsurer attributable to the run off of certain credit life insurance blocks. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $87 million, or 143%, to $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in investment income associated with an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments. The increase was also the result of a $28 million increase in interest income from two securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003 and an $18 million increase in partnership income. Net realized investment gains. See the comparison for this line item under Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $46 million to $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This was primarily the result of a $40 million gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in the fourth quarter. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves decreased $40 million, or 53%, to $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of lower litigation expenses and higher reserves at our Bermuda reinsurer. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, decreased $32 million, or 28%, to $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of $36 million lower allocated expenses from GE resulting from our corporate reorganization, $26 million of lower litigation expenses and $13 million of lower operating and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by expenses of $20 million relating to the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights in connection with our corporate reorganization and $23 million relating to the costs of establishing the Genworth brand. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles decreased $1 million, or 6%, to $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $64 million, or 47%, to $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of $45 million of interest expense associated with our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization and a $20 million increase attributable to the securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $38 million to ($65) million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from ($103) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decreased benefit was primarily due to a lower pre tax loss in 2004, a one time reduction in U.K. taxes related to the restructuring of our U.K. legal entities and favorable examination developments in 2003, which did not recur in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $47 million of tax benefits recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization. 127 Table of Contents Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) increased $106 million to $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $(54) million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in segment net earnings was primarily the result of an $87 million increase in net investment income primarily attributable to an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments, a $46 million tax benefit recognized in connection with our corporate reorganization, a $25 million after tax gain related to our waiver of contractual rights under an outsourcing services agreement with GEs global outsourcing provider, 60% of which was sold in 2004, and an increase in invested assets not required to be allocated to our operating segments partially offset by a $64 million increase in interest expense attributable to our revised debt structure following our corporate reorganization. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Premiums. Premiums increased $6 million, or 6%, to $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $4 million increase in premiums attributable to our Mexican auto insurer. Net investment income. Net investment income increased $41 million, or 205%, to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of a $36 million increase relating to the adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. Net realized investment gains. See the comparison for this line item under Historical and Pro Forma Results of Operations. Policy fees and other income. Policy fees and other income increased $2 million to $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves. Benefits and other changes in policy reserves increased $61 million, or 407%, to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of certain litigation settlements resulting in an increase in reserves, as well as increased claims in our Mexican auto insurer due to unfavorable weather conditions and increased costs in our Viking reinsurer relating to experience payments on previously novated businesses. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals. Underwriting, acquisition, insurance and other expenses, net of deferrals, increased $3 million, or 3%, to $115 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $45 million higher litigation expense during 2003, partially offset by $11 million of miscellaneous asset write offs, $10 million of expenses associated with the relocation of our long term care insurance business and $21 million of higher operating expenses during 2002. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and intangibles increased $8 million, or 80%, to $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $13 million, or 10%, to $137 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily the result of $27 million of interest expense associated with securitization entities that were consolidated in our financial statements in connection with our adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. This increase was offset in part by a $14 million decrease in interest expense that was primarily the result of lower average borrowings. Provision (benefit) for income taxes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes decreased $16 million to $(103) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $(119) million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This 128 Table of Contents decrease was the result of the recognition in 2002 of a favorable settlement with the IRS related to the treatment of certain reserves for obligations to policyholders of life insurance contracts, offset in part by lower pre tax earnings, a one time reduction in U.K. taxes related to the restructuring of our U.K. legal entities, and increased dividends received deduction benefits. Changes to tax expense for our Corporate and Other segment are primarily the result of tax exempt investment income and other items not directly allocated to specific products or segments. Segment net earnings (loss). Segment net earnings (loss) decreased $246 million to $(54) million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in benefit for income taxes attributable to the impact of the 2002 favorable settlement with the IRS, the decrease in net realized investment gains and higher litigation reserves for the year ended December 31, 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We conduct all our operations through our operating subsidiaries. Dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations, including payments of principal and interest on the notes. Our primary uses of funds at our holding company level include payment of general operating expenses, payment of principal, interest and other expenses related to holding company debt, payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock, amounts we will owe to GE under the Tax Matters Agreement, contract adjustment payments on our Equity Units, contributions to subsidiaries, and, potentially, acquisitions. We currently pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate of $0.065 per share. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Our payment of dividends to our stockholders will depend partly upon our receipt of dividends from our insurance and other operating subsidiaries. In addition, our Series A Preferred Stock bears dividends at an annual rate of 5.25% of the liquidation value of $50 per share. We also pay quarterly contract adjustment payments with respect to our Equity Units at an annual rate of 2.16% of the stated amount of $25 per Equity Unit. We declared dividends of $171 million to our parent during 2002, of which $107 million was paid in 2002 and $64 million was paid in 2003. We declared and paid dividends of $3,168 million to our parent during 2003, including a dividend of $2,930 million paid on December 15, 2003. This dividend included the distribution of proceeds from the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which closed on August 29, 2003, and other dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries. During 2004, as part of our corporate reorganization and prior to the IPO, we paid dividends of $2,029 million to our parent. Since the completion of the IPO, we have declared a dividend on our common stock of $32 million in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2004. The fourth quarter dividend was paid in January 2005. The payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $2,111 million ($1,244 million of which were deemed extraordinary), $1,472 million ($1,400 million of which were deemed extraordinary) and $840 million ($375 million of which were deemed extraordinary), respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received dividends from insurance subsidiaries related to discontinued operations of $0, $495 million and $62 million, respectively. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, also are subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings. Based on statutory results as of December 31, 2004, our subsidiaries could pay dividends of $1,450 million to us in 2005 without obtaining regulatory approval. However, as a result of the dividends we paid in connection with our corporate reorganization, most of our insurance subsidiaries will not be able to pay us dividends until 129 Table of Contents April 15, 2005. As part of our corporate reorganization, we retained cash at the holding company level which we believe will be adequate to fund our dividend payments, debt service, obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement and other obligations until our insurance subsidiaries can resume paying ordinary dividends to us. In addition, we received a dividend of $700 million from our U.S. mortgage insurance business in December 2004 (included above in dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries) following the release of statutory contingency reserves from that business. We used $550 million of those proceeds to repay the Contingent Note, and we have retained the remaining $150 million in a segregated account at our holding company to pay debt servicing expenses and dividends on our common stock. Of this amount, we expect that $50 million will be available for disbursement during 2005, and $100 million will be available for disbursement during 2006. In addition to dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, our other sources of funds will include service fees we receive from GE, as described under Overview Separation from GE and related financial arrangements Services provided to GE, payments from our subsidiaries pursuant to tax sharing arrangements, borrowings pursuant to our credit facilities, and proceeds from any additional issuance of commercial paper. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion note and the $550 million Contingent Note. As described above, the Contingent Note was repaid in December 2004 with a portion of the proceeds of a $700 million dividend paid to us by our U.S. mortgage insurance business. We repaid the $2.4 billion note upon the completion of the IPO with borrowings under a short term credit facility. We repaid those borrowings shortly thereafter with proceeds from our offering of $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper. The $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes includes $500 million LIBOR Floating Rate Notes due 2007, $500 million 4.75% Notes due 2009, $600 million 5.75% Notes due 2014, and $300 million 6.50% Notes due 2034. As a result of hedging arrangements entered into with respect to these securities, our effective interest rates are 3.53% on the 2007 notes, 4.48% on the 2009 notes, 5.51% on the 2014 notes and 6.35% on the 2034 notes. The commercial paper was issued under a $1 billion commercial paper program that we have established. We may issue additional commercial paper under this program from time to time. The liabilities we assumed from GEFAHI include the Yen Notes, which are &yen;60 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.60% notes due 2011 issued by GEFAHI, &yen;3 billion of which GEFAHI held and transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. In the third quarter of 2004, we retired the &yen;3 billion of Yen Notes that were transferred to us. We have entered into arrangements to swap our obligations under the Yen Notes to a U.S. dollar obligation with a principal amount of $491 million and bearing interest at a rate of 4.84% per annum. In connection with our corporate reorganization, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with GE, which represents an obligation by us to GE that is estimated to have a present value of approximately $389 million. In connection with our corporate reorganization, we also entered into $2 billion of revolving credit facilities, including a $1.0 billion 364 day facility and a $1.0 billion five year facility. The revolving credit facilities support our commercial paper program and provide us with liquidity to meet general funding requirements. We expect to replace the 364 day facility upon its expiration with a similar or longer term credit facility. Our ability to borrow under these facilities and to issue commercial paper in excess of $500 million in the aggregate may be subject to GEs right as the holder of the Class B Common Stock to approve our incurrence of debt in excess of $700 million outstanding at any one time (subject to certain exceptions). We believe our revolving credit facilities, further issuances under our commercial paper program and anticipated cash flows from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. For further information about our borrowings, see note 14 to our financial statements, included in Item 8. of this Annual Report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,498 million, $3,716 million and $4,883 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums received, fees received and investment income. Principal sources of cash include sales 130 Table of Contents of our products and services. The increase in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 of $1,782 million and the decrease in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 of $1,167 million was primarily the result of the timing of cash settlement for other assets and liabilities. As an insurance business, we typically generate positive cash flows from operating and financing activities, as premiums and deposits collected from our insurance and investment products exceed benefits paid and redemptions, and we invest the excess. Accordingly, in analyzing our cash flow we focus on the change in the amount of cash available and used in investing activities. Net cash from investing activities was $(5,404) million, $(681) million and $(6,525) million for the years December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003, of $4,723 million was primarily the result of a $1,621 million decrease in cash provided by the proceeds from the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses in 2003 that did not recur in 2004 and an increase of $2,057 million in net investment purchases. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, of $5,844 million was the result of both less cash provided by operating activities of $1,167 million, as discussed above, and more cash used in financing activities of $5,007 million. Within our investing activities, during 2003, we received $2,126 million of proceeds and dividends associated with the sale of our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses. Net cash from financing activities was $(791) million, $(2,714) and $2,293 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Changes in cash from financing activities primarily relate to the issuance and repayment of borrowings, dividends to our stockholders and other capital transactions, as well as the issuance of, and redemptions and benefit payments on, investment contracts. The $1,923 million increase in cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, was primarily the result of an increase in net cash flows from our stockholder, primarily in transactions related to our corporate reorganization, of $2,430 million, as well as the issuance of long term borrowings of $1,895 million and lower net redemptions and deposits in investment contracts of $678 million, partially offset by the decrease in net short term borrowings of $2,713 million and the repayment of the $550 million Contingent Note. The decrease in cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, of $5,007 million was primarily the result of both lower deposits and higher redemptions of investment contracts, as a result of the lower interest rate environment, equity market downturns and volatility and pricing actions we took. These factors contributed to a decrease in the use of net cash from investment contracts by $3,202 million. In addition, dividends paid to our stockholder, net of capital contributions received, increased by $2,871 million. These increased uses of cash were partially offset by a net increase in cash provided from borrowings of $1,066 million, consisting of a net increase in short term borrowings, including commercial paper, of $466 million, and an increase in non recourse funding obligations of $600 million. The liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries principally relate to the liabilities associated with their various insurance and investment products, operating costs and expenses, the payment of dividends to us, contributions to their subsidiaries, payment of principal and interest on their outstanding debt obligations and income taxes. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment products include the payment of benefits, as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders and withdrawals, policy loans and obligations to redeem funding agreements under applicable put option provisions. Historically, our insurance subsidiaries have used cash flow from operations and sales of investment securities to fund their liquidity requirements. Our insurance subsidiaries principal cash inflows from operating activities derive from premiums, annuity deposits and policy and contract fees and other income, including commissions, cost of insurance, mortality, expense and surrender charges, contract underwriting fees, investment management fees, and dividends and distributions from their subsidiaries. The principal cash inflows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, sales of invested assets and investment income. 131 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $2.8 billion of renewable floating rate funding agreements, which are deposit type products that generally credit interest on deposits at a floating rate tied to an external market index. Purchasers of renewable funding agreements include money market funds, bank common trust funds and other short term investors. Some of our funding agreements contain put provisions, through which the contractholder has an option to terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contracts specified notice period, which is generally 90 days. Of the $2.8 billion aggregate amount outstanding as of December 31, 2004, $1.6 billion had put option features, none of which were less than 90 days. GE Capital has guaranteed certain obligations under floating rate funding agreements with a final maturity on or before June 30, 2005. This guarantee covers our obligations to contractholders and requires us to reimburse GE Capital for any payments made to contractholders under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2004, GE Capitals guarantee covered $1.4 billion of outstanding floating rate funding agreements. Our insurance subsidiaries maintain investment strategies intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. Products having liabilities with longer durations, such as certain life insurance and long term care insurance policies, are matched with investments having similar estimated lives such as long term fixed maturities and mortgage loans. Shorter term liabilities are matched with fixed maturities that have short and medium term fixed maturities. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries hold highly liquid, high quality short term investment securities and other liquid investment grade fixed maturities to fund anticipated operating expenses, surrenders, and withdrawals. As of December 31, 2004, our total cash and invested assets was $67.1 billion. Our investments in privately placed fixed maturities, mortgage loans, policy loans, limited partnership interests and restricted investments held by securitization entities are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented approximately 30% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2004. Total assets were $103.9 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $103.4 billion as of December 31, 2003. Total assets remained relatively unchanged, with an increase in assets primarily attributable to normal business growth, partially offset by a decrease of $5.7 billion of assets that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. Total liabilities were $91.0 billion as of December 31, 2004, compared to $87.6 billion as of December 31, 2003. This increase of $3.4 billion was primarily due to growth in contractholder liabilities, as well as the issuance of $600 million of our Equity Units and $100 million of our mandatorily redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, partially offset by the tax impact of our corporate reorganization and other liabilities that were not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. Contractual obligations We enter into obligations to third parties in the ordinary course of our operations. These obligations, as of December 31, 2004, are set forth in the table below. However, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations. The most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers. Future cash outflows, whether they are contractual obligations or not, also will vary based upon our future needs. Although some outflows are fixed, others depend on future events. Examples of fixed obligations include our obligations to pay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings. Examples of obligations that will vary include obligations to pay interest on variable rate borrowings and insurance liabilities that depend on future interest rates and market performance. Many of our obligations are linked to cash generating contracts. These obligations include payments to contractholders that assume those contractholders will continue to make deposits in accordance with the terms of their contracts. In addition, our operations involve significant expenditures that are not based upon commitments. These include expenditures for income taxes and payroll. 132 Table of Contents Payments due by period (Dollar amounts in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 and thereafter Borrowings(1) $ 4,606 $ 559 $ 500 $ 1,100 $ 2,447 Operating lease obligations 139 29 47 37 26 Purchase obligations(2) 289 149 56 48 36 Insurance liabilities(3) 60,643 10,060 13,623 10,393 26,567 Other contractual liabilities(4) 625 31 41 54 499 Total contractual obligations $ 66,302 $ 10,828 $ 14,267 $ 11,632 $ 29,575 (1) Includes principal of our short and long term borrowings, non recourse funding obligations, senior notes underlying equity units and mandatorily redeemable Series A Preferred Stock, as described in note 14 to our financial statements. Any payment of principal of, including by redemption, or interest on, the non recourse funding obligations is subject to regulatory approval. (2) Includes contractual purchase commitments; excludes funding commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business. (3) Includes guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements, structured settlements and income annuities (including contracts we ceded to UFLIC, because we remain the primary obligor under those contracts), based upon scheduled payouts, as well as those contracts with reasonably determinable cash flow, such as deferred annuities, universal life, term life, long term care, whole life and other life insurance contracts. (4) Because their future cash outflows are uncertain, the following non current liabilities are excluded from this table: deferred taxes (except the Tax Matters Agreement, which is included, as described in note 15 to our financial statements), derivatives, deferred revenue and certain other items. Impairments of Investment Securities We regularly review investment securities for impairment in accordance with our impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position, and for fixed maturities, whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Our qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent to hold the security until recovery. Our impairment reviews involve our finance, risk and asset management teams, as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of GEAM and other third party asset managers, as required. Our qualitative review attempts to identify those issuers with a greater than 50% chance of default in the coming twelve months. These securities are characterized as at risk of impairment. As of December 31, 2004, securities at risk of impairment had aggregate unrealized losses of approximately $50 million. For fixed maturities, we recognize an impairment charge to earnings in the period in which we determine that we do not expect either to collect principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments or to recover based upon underlying collateral values, considering events such as a payment default, bankruptcy or disclosure of fraud. For equity securities, we recognize an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that the security will not recover to book value within a reasonable period. We determine what constitutes a reasonable period on a security by security basis based upon consideration of all the evidence available to us, including the magnitude of an unrealized loss and its duration. In any event, this period does not exceed 18 months for common equity securities. We measure impairment charges based upon the difference between the book value of a security and its fair value. Fair value is based upon quoted market price, except for certain infrequently traded securities where we estimate values using internally developed pricing models. These models are based upon common valuation techniques and require us to make assumptions regarding credit quality, liquidity and other factors that affect estimated values. The carrying value of infrequently traded securities as of December 31, 2004 was $12.3 billion. 133 Table of Contents For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized impairments of $26 million and $224 million, respectively. We generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they recover. However, from time to time, we sell securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio to meet diversification, credit quality, yield and liquidity requirements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the pre tax realized investment loss incurred on the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities was $38 million. The aggregate fair value of securities sold at a loss during twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 billion, which was approximately 98.6% of book value. The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values of our investment securities, aggregated by investment type and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004: Less Than 12 Months (Dollar amounts in millions) Amortized costor cost Estimated fairvalue Grossunrealizedlosses % below cost # of securities Description of Securities Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agencies $ 115 $ 114 $ (1 ) 0.9 % 15 State and municipal 89 88 (1 ) 1.1 % 28 Government non U.S. 225 222 (3 ) 1.3 % 32 U.S. corporate 3,496 3,426 (70 ) 2.0 % 400 Corporate non U.S. 1,224 1,207 (17 ) 1.4 % 155 Asset Backed 857 853 (4 ) 0.5 % 125 Mortgage Backed 2,807 2,776 (31 ) 1.1 % 259 Subtotal, fixed maturities 8,813 8,686 (127 ) 1.4 % 1,014 Equities securities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 % Below cost fixed maturities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 8,799 $ 8,678 $ (121 ) 1.4 % 1,002 20 50% Below cost 14 8 (6 ) 42.9 % 6 &gt;50% Below cost 6 Total fixed maturities 8,813 8,686 (127 ) 1.4 % 1,014 % Below cost equity securities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 7 $ 7 $ 12 20 50% Below cost &gt;50% Below cost 1 Total equity maturities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 Investment grade $ 8,026 $ 7,930 $ (96 ) 1.2 % 869 Below investment grade 600 575 (25 ) 4.2 % 114 Not Rated Fixed maturities 187 181 (6 ) 3.2 % 31 Not Rated Equities 7 7 13 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 8,820 $ 8,693 $ (127 ) 1.4 % 1,027 134 Table of Contents 12 Months or More (Dollar amounts in millions) Amortized costor cost Estimated fairvalue Grossunrealizedlosses % below cost # of securities Description of Securities Fixed maturities: U.S. government and agencies $ 3 $ 3 $ 1 State and municipal 1 1 2 Government non U.S. 106 106 30 U.S. corporate 834 763 (71 ) 8.5 % 127 Corporate non U.S. 181 176 (5 ) 2.8 % 35 Asset Backed 55 54 (1 ) 1.8 % 5 Mortgage Backed 244 233 (11 ) 4.5 % 78 Subtotal, fixed maturities 1,424 1,336 (88 ) 6.2 % 278 Equities securities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 % Below cost fixed maturities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 1,319 $ 1,262 $ (57 ) 4.3 % 234 20 50% Below cost 95 69 (26 ) 27.4 % 23 &gt;50% Below cost 10 5 (5 ) 50.0 % 21 Total fixed maturities 1,424 1,336 (88 ) 6.2 % 278 % Below cost equity securities: &lt;20% Below cost $ 21 $ 20 $ (1 ) 4.8 % 8 20 50% Below cost 2 1 (1 ) 50.0 % 10 &gt;50% Below cost 1 Total equity maturities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 Investment grade $ 973 $ 934 $ (39 ) 4.0 % 188 Below investment grade 450 401 (49 ) 10.9 % 88 Not Rated Fixed maturities 1 1 2 Not Rated Equities 23 21 (2 ) 8.7 % 19 Total temporarily impaired securities $ 1,447 $ 1,357 $ (90 ) 6.2 % 297 The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 for less than twelve months account for $127 million, or 58%, of our total unrealized losses. Of the securities in this category, there were three securities with an unrealized loss in excess of $5 million. These three securities had aggregate unrealized losses of $18 million. The amount of the unrealized loss on these securities is driven primarily by the relative size of the holdings, the par values of which range from $15 million to $386 million, the maturities, which range from 2010 to 2036, and the credit quality of the issuers. The issuer of the investment scheduled to mature in 2010 prepaid the related principal and interest along with a prepayment fee in January 2005. The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2004 for twelve months or more account for $90 million, or 42%, of our total unrealized losses. There are 104 fixed maturities in four industry groups that account for $54 million, or 60%, of the unrealized losses in this category. Forty four of these 104 securities are in the finance and insurance sector. Within this sector, no single issue has unrealized losses greater than $5 million. The unrealized losses of these securities are due primarily to changes in interest rates from the time the securities were purchased. Thirty five of these 104 securities are in the transportation sector and are related to the airline industry. All of our airline securities, with one exception, are collateralized by commercial jet aircraft associated with several 135 Table of Contents domestic airlines and one cargo airline. The collateral underlying these securities consists of commercial jet aircraft, except for one that is secured by airline ticket receivables. We believe these security holdings are in a temporary loss position as a result of ongoing negative market reaction to difficulties in the commercial airline industry. Within this sector, we have recognized $1 million and $36 million of other than temporary impairments in 2004 and 2003, respectively. These holdings were written down to estimated fair value based upon the present value of expected cash flows associated with revised lease terms or the value of the underlying aircraft. As of December 31, 2004, we expect to collect full principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments of our remaining holdings in airline securities. For those airline securities that we have previously impaired, we expect to recover our carrying amount based upon underlying aircraft collateral values. Fourteen of these 104 securities are in the consumer non cyclical sector, of which there was one issuer with unrealized losses in excess of $5 million. This issuer, which had a $7 million unrealized loss, is in the tobacco industry, is current on all terms, shows improving trends with regards to liquidity and security price and is not considered at risk of impairment. Each of the other securities in this sector has unrealized losses of less than $5 million. Eleven of these 104 securities are in the consumer non cyclical sector, of which there was one issuer with unrealized losses in excess of $5 million. The aggregate par value of securities was $37 million. This issuer is current on all terms and is not considered at risk of impairment. In the remaining industry sectors, as of December 31, 2004, one issuer of fixed maturity securities had an unrealized loss of $5 million. This issuer is current on all terms, has sufficient liquidity to service current debt obligations and is seeking additional financing. No other single issuer of fixed maturities in these sectors has an unrealized loss of greater than $5 million. The equity securities in an unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004, for twelve months or more are primarily preferred stocks with fixed maturity like characteristics. No single security had an unrealized loss greater than $2 million. Off balance Sheet Transactions We have used off balance sheet securitization transactions to mitigate and diversify our asset risk position and to adjust the asset class mix in our investment portfolio by reinvesting securitization proceeds in accordance with our approved investment guidelines. We have not used securitization transactions to provide us with additional liquidity, and we do not anticipate using securitization transactions for that purpose in the future. The transactions we have used involved securitizations of some of our receivables and investments that were secured by commercial mortgage loans, fixed maturities or other receivables, consisting primarily of policy loans. Total securitized assets remaining as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were $1.6 billion. Securitization transactions resulted in net gains, before taxes, of approximately $43 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and were included in net realized investment gains (losses) in our financial statements. There were no securitization transactions in the year ended December 31, 2004. We have arranged for the assets that we have transferred in securitization transactions to be serviced by us directly or pursuant to arrangements and with General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Servicing activities include ongoing review, credit monitoring, reporting and collection activities. We have entered into credit support arrangements in connection with our securitization transactions. Pursuant to these arrangements, as of December 31, 2004, we provided limited recourse for a maximum of $119 million of credit losses. To date, we have not yet been required to make payments under any of these credit support agreements. The agreements will remain in place throughout the life of the related entities. 136 Table of Contents GE Capital, our indirect parent and majority stockholder, provides credit and liquidity support to a funding conduit it sponsored, which exposes it to a majority of the risks and rewards of the conduits activities and therefore makes GE Capital the primary beneficiary of the funding conduit. Upon adoption of FIN 46, GE Capital was required to consolidate the funding conduit because of this financial support. As a result, assets and liabilities of certain previously off balance sheet securitization entities, for which we were the transferor, were required to be included in our financial statements because the funding conduit no longer qualified as a third party. Because these securitization entities lost their qualifying status, we were required to include $1.2 billion of securitized assets and $1.1 billion of associated liabilities in our Statement of Financial Position in July 2003. The assets and liabilities associated with these securitization entities have been reported in the corresponding financial statement captions in our Statement of Financial Position, and the assets are noted as restricted due to the lack of legal control we have over them. These balances will decrease as the assets mature because we will not sell any additional assets to these consolidated entities. Our inclusion of these assets and liabilities does not change the economic or legal characteristics of the asset sales. Liabilities of these consolidated entities will be repaid with cash flows generated by the related assets. Credit recourse to us remains limited to the credit support described above. We included $36 million of revenue, $2 million of general expenses and $27 million of interest expense associated with these newly consolidated entities in our historical financial statements for the period from July 1 to December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we included $64 million of revenue, $3 million of general expenses and $47 million of interest expense associated with these entities in our historical financial statements. Our consolidation of these securitization entities had no effect on our previously reported earnings. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities associated with the securitization entities we included in our Statement of Financial Position, which are part of our Corporate and Other segment as of the dates indicated: December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2004 2003 Assets: Restricted investments held by securitization entities $ 860 $ 1,069 Other assets 24 65 Total(1) $ 884 $ 1,134 Liabilities: Borrowings related to securitization entities $ 849 $ 1,018 Other liabilities 3 59 Total $ 852 $ 1,077 (1) Includes $31 million and $51 million of retained interests in securitized assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, that are consolidated. Seasonality In general, our business as a whole is not seasonal in nature. However, in our Mortgage Insurance segment, the level of defaults, which increases the likelihood of losses, tends to decrease in the first and second quarters of the calendar year and increase in the third and fourth quarters. As a result, we have experienced lower levels of losses resulting from defaults in the first and second quarters, as compared with the third and fourth quarters. Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our historical results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates. 137 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Currently effective In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03 1 (SOP 03 1), Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts, which we adopted on January 1, 2004. SOP 03 1 provides guidance on separate account presentation and valuation, accounting for sales inducements to contractholders and classification and valuation of long duration contract liabilities. Prior to adopting SOP 03 1 we held reserves for the higher tier annuitization benefit on two tiered annuities. To record these reserves in accordance with SOP 03 1, we released $10 million, or 7%, of our two tiered annuity reserves and $3 million of guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves. After giving effect to the impact of additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to these reserve releases, we recorded a $5 million benefit in cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of taxes, which is not reflected in net earnings from continuing operations. Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123R Share Based Payments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95, which we will adopt on July 1, 2005. This statement provides additional guidance on accounting for share based payments and will require all such awards to be measured at fair value with the related compensation cost recognized in income on a prospective basis. We currently recognize compensation cost using the fair value method for all stock based awards issued after January 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded. The following is a discussion of our market risk exposures and our risk management practices. We enter into market sensitive instruments primarily for purposes other than trading. The carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $66 billion and $79 billion, respectively, of which 80% and 83%, respectively, was invested in fixed maturities. The primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities. We mitigate the market risk associated with our fixed maturities portfolio by closely matching the duration of our fixed maturities with the duration of the liabilities that those securities are intended to support. The primary market risk for our long term borrowings and Equity Units is interest rate risk at the time of maturity or early redemption, when we may be required to refinance these obligations. We continue to monitor the interest rate environment and to evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. We are exposed to equity risk on our holdings of common stocks and other equities. We manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. We also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. Our international operations generate revenues denominated in local currencies, and we invest cash generated outside the U.S. in non U.S. denominated securities. Although investing in securities denominated in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, we remain exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our historical combined financial statements. We currently do not hedge this exposure. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 29% and 26%, respectively, of our net earnings from continuing operations were generated by our international operations. 138 Table of Contents We use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate and currency swaps, currency forwards and option based financial instruments, as part of our risk management strategy. We use these derivatives to mitigate certain risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk and equity risk, by: reducing the risk between the timing of the receipt of cash and its investment in the market; matching the currency of invested assets with the liabilities they support; converting the asset duration to match the duration of the liabilities; reducing our exposure to fluctuations in equity market indices that underlie some of our products; and protecting against the early termination of an asset or liability. As a matter of policy, we have not and will not engage in derivative market making, speculative derivative trading or other speculative derivatives activities. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other market rates or prices on the profitability of market sensitive financial instruments. The following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices is based on so called shock tests, which model the effects of interest rate, foreign exchange rate and equity market price shifts on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe shock tests provide the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, they are constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. Although the following results of shock tests for changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices may have some limited use as benchmarks, they should not be viewed as forecasts. These forward looking disclosures also are selective in nature and address only the potential impacts on our financial instruments. They do not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of these changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity market prices. One means of assessing exposure of our fixed maturities portfolio to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential changes in market value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points across all maturities. This is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve. Under this model, with all other factors constant and assuming no offsetting change in the value of our liabilities, we estimated that such an increase in interest rates would cause the market value of our fixed income securities portfolio to decline by approximately $2.9 billion, based on our securities positions as of December 31, 2004. One means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis. We analyzed our combined currency exposure as of December 31, 2004, including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges to identify assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their relevant functional currencies. Net unhedged exposures in each currency were then remeasured, generally assuming a 10% decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Under this model, with all other factors constant, we estimated as of December 31, 2004, that such a decrease would have an insignificant effect on our net earnings from continuing operations. One means of assessing exposure to changes in equity market prices is to estimate the potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 10%. Under this model, with all other factors constant, we estimated that such a decline in equity market prices would cause the market value of our equity investments to decline by approximately $8 million, 139 Table of Contents based on our equity positions as of December 31, 2004. In addition, fluctuations in equity market prices affect our revenues and returns from our separate account and private asset management products, which depend upon fees that are related primarily to the value of assets under management. Counterparty credit risk We manage counterparty credit risk on an individual counterparty basis, which means that gains and losses are netted for each counterparty to determine the amount at risk. When a counterparty exceeds credit exposure limits (see table below) in terms of amounts owed to us, typically as the result of changes in market conditions, no additional transactions are executed until the exposure with that counterparty is reduced to an amount that is within the established limit. All swaps are executed under master swap agreements containing mutual credit downgrade provisions that provide the ability to require assignment or termination in the event either party is downgraded below Moodys A3 or S&Ps A . Swaps, purchased options and forwards with contractual maturities longer than one year are conducted within the credit policy constraints provided in the table below. Our policy permits us to enter into derivative transactions with counterparties rated A3 by Moodys and A by S&P if the agreements governing such transactions require both parties to provide collateral in certain circumstances. Our policy further requires foreign exchange forwards with contractual maturities shorter than one year to be executed with counterparties having a credit rating by Moodys of A 1 and by S&P of P 1 and the credit limit for these transactions is $150 million per counterparty.
