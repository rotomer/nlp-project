During the accumulation period, we credit the account value of the annuity with interest earned at an interest rate, called the crediting rate. The crediting rate is guaranteed generally for one year but may be guaranteed for up to seven years, at the contractholders option, and thereafter is subject to annual changes at our discretion, based upon competitive factors, prevailing market rates and product profitability. Each contract also has a minimum guaranteed crediting rate. Our fixed annuity contracts are funded by our general account, and the accrual of 18 Table of Contents interest during the accumulation period is generally on a tax deferred basis to the owner. The majority of our fixed annuity contractholders retain their contracts for 5 to 10 years. After the period specified in the annuity contract, the contractholder may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity as a single payment or over time. Our fixed annuity contracts permit the contractholder at any time during the accumulation period to withdraw all or part of the premiums paid, plus the amount credited to his account, subject to contract provisions such as surrender charges that vary depending upon the terms of the product. The contracts impose surrender charges that typically vary from 5.0% to 9.0% of the account value, starting in the year of deposit and decreasing to zero over a 5 to 9 year period. The contractholder also may withdraw annually up to 10% of the account value without any contractual penalty. Approximately $11.9 billion, or 77% of the total account value of our fixed annuities as of December 31, 2005, were subject to surrender charges. At least once each month, we set an interest crediting rate for newly issued fixed SPDAs and additional deposits. We maintain the initial crediting rate for a minimum period of one year or the guarantee period, whichever is longer. Thereafter, we may adjust the crediting rate no more frequently than once per year for any given deposit. Our recently issued annuity contracts have minimum guaranteed crediting rates between 1.5% and 3.0%. Fixed immediate annuities In exchange for a single premium, fixed immediate annuities provide a fixed amount of income for either a defined number of years, the annuitants lifetime, or the greater of the two periods. Income can be paid monthly, quarterly, semi annually or annually and generally begins within one year of receipt of the premium. Fixed immediate annuities also include annuitizations chosen as a settlement option for an existing deferred annuity contract. Our fixed immediate annuities differ from deferred annuities in that they provide for contractually guaranteed payments that begin within one year of issue. Fixed immediate annuities do not provide for surrender or policy loans by the contractholder, and therefore they provide us with the opportunity to match closely the underlying investment of the deposit received to the cash benefits to be paid under a policy and provide for an anticipated margin for expenses and profit, subject to credit, reinvestment and, in some cases, mortality risk. The two most common types of fixed immediate annuities are the life contingent annuity, which makes payments for the life of a contractholder, and the joint and survivor annuity, which continues to make payments to a second contractholder, such as a spouse, after the death of the contractholder. We also offer period certain annuities, which generally make payments for a minimum period from 5 to 30 years even if the contractholder dies within the term certain period. Fixed immediate annuities typically are sold to contractholders approaching retirement. We anticipate higher sales of fixed immediate annuities with the demographic shift toward more people reaching retirement age and focusing on their need for dependable retirement income. Structured settlements Structured settlement contracts provide an alternative to a lump sum settlement, generally in a personal injury lawsuit or workers compensation claim, and typically are purchased by property and casualty insurance companies for the benefit of an injured claimant. The structured settlements provide scheduled payments over a fixed period or, in the case of a life contingent structured settlement, for the life of the claimant with a guaranteed minimum period of payments. Structured settlement contracts also may provide for irregularly scheduled payments to coincide with anticipated medical or other claimant needs. These settlements offer tax advantaged, long range financial security to the injured party and facilitate claim settlement for the property and casualty insurance carrier. Structured settlement contracts are long term in nature, guarantee a fixed benefit stream and generally do not permit surrender or borrowing against the amounts outstanding under the contract. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we ceded all of our in force structured settlements business to Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). We continue to write structured settlements selectively when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns, capitalizing on our experience and relationships in this product. 19 Table of Contents Spread based institutional products We offer GICs and funding agreements (including those issued pursuant to our registered notes program) which are deposit type products that pay a guaranteed return to the contractholder on specified dates. GICs are purchased by ERISA qualified plans, including pension and 401(k) plans. Funding agreements are purchased by institutional accredited investors for various kinds of funds and accounts that are not ERISA qualified. Purchasers of funding agreements include money market funds, bank common trust funds and other corporate and trust accounts and private investors including Genworth Global Funding Trust as part of our registered notes program. Substantially all our GICs allow for the payment of benefits at contract value (on a pro rata basis as to plan participants) to ERISA plan participants prior to contract maturity in the event of death, disability, retirement or change in investment election. We carefully underwrite these risks before issuing a GIC to a plan and historically have been able to effectively manage our exposure to these benefit payments. Our GICs typically credit interest at a fixed interest rate and have a fixed maturity generally ranging from two to six years. Our funding agreements generally credit interest on deposits at a floating rate tied to an external market index. To hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we invest the proceeds backing floating rate funding agreements in floating rate assets. Some of our funding agreements are purchased by money market funds, bank common trust funds and other short term investors. These funding agreements typically are renewed annually, and generally contain put provisions, through which the contractholder has an option to terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contracts specified notice period, which is generally 90 180 days. As of December 31, 2005, we had an aggregate of $2.7 billion of floating rate funding agreements outstanding, compared to $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2004. Of the $2.7 billion aggregate amount outstanding as of December 31, 2005, $1.0 billion had put option features, including $558 million with put option features of 90 days and the remaining $450 million with put option features of 180 days. We also issue funding agreements to trust accounts to back medium term notes purchased by investors. These contracts typically are issued for terms of one to seven years. As of December 31, 2005, we had an aggregate of $3.9 billion of these funding agreements, compared to $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2004. Of the $3.9 billion of these funding agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2005, $0.4 billion permitted early termination provisions upon twelve months notice and $0.7 billion permit early termination upon twenty one months notice. The remainder of these funding agreements did not permit early termination. Fee based products Variable annuities We offer variable annuities that allow the contractholder to make payments into a separate account that is divided into subaccounts that invest in underlying mutual funds. The contractholder also has an option to make allocations to a guaranteed interest rate account that is a part of our general account. All allocations are determined by the contractholder. Like a deferred fixed annuity, a deferred variable annuity has an accumulation period and a payout period. The main difference between our fixed annuity products and our variable annuity products is that the variable annuities allow the contractholder to allocate all or a portion of his account value to separate accounts that invest in investment accounts that are distinct from our general account. Assets allocated to each separate account have subaccounts that track the performance of selected mutual funds. There is no guaranteed minimum rate of return in these subaccounts, and the contractholder bears the entire risk associated with the performance of these subaccounts. Some of our variable annuities also permit the contractholder to allocate all or a portion of his account value to our general account, in which case we credit interest at specified rates, subject to certain guaranteed minimums. Similar to our fixed annuities, our variable annuity contracts permit the contractholder to withdraw all or part of the premiums paid, plus the amount credited to his account, subject to contract terms such as surrender charges. The cash surrender value of a variable annuity contract depends upon the value of the assets that have been allocated to the contract, how long those assets have been in the contract and the investment performance of the subaccounts that invest in the mutual funds to which the contractholder has allocated assets. 20 Table of Contents Variable annuities provide us with fee based revenue in the form of expense charges and, in some cases, mortality charges. The fees equal a percentage of the contractholders assets in the separate account and typically range from 1.45% to 1.70% per annum. We also receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate account to cover administrative costs and, in some cases, a distribution fee from the underlying mutual funds in which assets are invested. Our variable annuity contracts provide a basic guaranteed minimum death benefit, or GMDB, which provides a minimum account value to be paid upon the annuitants death. Contractholders also have the option to purchase through riders, at an additional charge, enhanced death benefits. Assuming every annuitant died on December 31, 2005, as of that date, contracts with death benefit features not covered by reinsurance had an account value of $2.1 billion and a related death benefit exposure of $8 million net amount at risk. In 2003, we raised prices of, and reduced certain benefits under, our newly issued GMDBs. We continue to evaluate our pricing, hedging and reinsurance of GMDB features and intend to change prices as appropriate. In addition, in 2004, we introduced a variable annuity product with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or GMWB. This product provides a guaranteed annual withdrawal of a fixed portion of the initial deposit over a fixed period of time, but requires a balanced asset allocation of the contractholders separate account deposit. In 2005, we expanded our GMWB lineup by offering a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for the life of the contractholder while maintaining our requirement for a balanced assets allocation of the contractholders separate account deposit. GMWB for life is a component of our Income Distribution Series of variable annuity products and riders. With some employers moving away from traditional defined benefit pension plans to 401(k) plans, in October 2005 we responded by introducing ClearCourseSM, a group variable annuity product. The ClearCourseSM product is designed to represent an investment option within a companys 401(k) retirement plan. It offers participants the ability to build guaranteed retirement income while maintaining liquidity and growth potential. ClearCourseSM provides participants with the ability to access defined benefit like features within a defined contribution environment. The product is distributed via direct salespeople and through third party benefits administrators. We continually review potential new variable annuity products and pursue only those where we believe we can achieve targeted returns in light of the risks involved. Unlike several of our competitors, we have not offered variable annuity products with traditional guaranteed minimum income benefits, or GMIBs, or with guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits, or GMABs. Traditional GMIB products guarantee an annuitization value for guaranteed income payments equal to the premium accumulated at a specified minimum appreciation rate for a defined period of time, after which annuity payments commence. GMAB products guarantee a customers account value will be no less than the original investment at the end of a specified accumulation period, plus a specified interest rate. Although we do not offer traditional GMIBs or GMABs, we have been able to capitalize on the demand for products with guarantees with our Retirement Answer product. Retirement Answer is a variable deferred annuity that has a minimum 10 year scheduled deposit period for customers who desire guaranteed minimum income streams at the end of an accumulation period. The income stream may exceed the guaranteed minimum based upon the performance of the subaccount investing in the mutual fund underlying the separate accounts. As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.56 billion of lump sum deposits, collected scheduled periodic deposits, and future scheduled periodic deposits for this product. Based on key product design features, some of which have patents pending, we believe Retirement Answer allows us to provide our customers with a guaranteed income annuity product that mitigates a number of the risks that accompany traditional guaranteed minimum income benefits offered by many of our competitors. Retirement Answer is a component of our Income Distribution Series of variable annuity products and riders. The Income Distribution Series also includes Guaranteed Income Advantage, or GIA, and Principal Protection Advantage, or PPA. GIA is a rider to several of our variable annuity products that provides retirement 21 Table of Contents benefits similar to Retirement Answer which requires contractholders to allocate assets to a specific investment option to obtain the minimum guarantee. PPA requires investment in available balanced funds and or an approved asset allocation strategy. The Retirement Answer and the GIA require a minimum ten year accumulation period, and the PPA, which is designed for purchasers nearing retirement, requires only a three year accumulation period before annuitization. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we ceded our in force variable annuities business, excluding the Retirement Answer product and a small block of contracts in run off, to UFLIC. Variable life insurance We offer variable life insurance products that provide insurance coverage through a policy that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, in some products, in premium payments and coverage amounts. Our variable life products allow the policyholder to allocate all or a portion of his premiums to separate subaccounts that invest in investment accounts that are distinct from our general account. Assets allocated to each separate subaccount track the performance of selected mutual funds. There is no guaranteed minimum rate of return in these subaccounts, and the policyholder bears the entire investment risk associated with the performance of the subaccounts. Some of our variable life insurance products also permit the policyholder to allocate all or a portion of his account value to our general account, in which case we credit interest at specified rates, subject to certain guaranteed minimums, which are comparable to the minimum rates in effect for our fixed annuities. Similar to our variable annuity products, we collect specified mortality and expense charges, fees charged on assets allocated to the separate subaccount to cover administrative services and costs, and a portion of the management fees from the various underlying mutual funds in which the assets are invested. We collect the cost of insurance charges on our variable life insurance products to compensate us for the mortality risk of the guaranteed death benefit, particularly in the early years of the policy when the death benefit is significantly higher than the value of the policyholders account. Asset management We offer asset management services to affluent individual investors. Most of our clients for these services have accumulated significant capital, and our principal asset management strategy is to help protect their assets while taking advantage of opportunities for capital appreciation. Our asset management clients are referred to us through financial advisers. We work with these financial advisers to develop portfolios consisting of individual securities, mutual funds and variable annuities designed to meet each clients particular investment objectives. Our products consist of separately managed accounts, managed mutual funds accounts, and managed variable annuity services. For each of these products, we receive a management fee based upon the amount of assets under management. Separately managed accounts are individually managed client portfolios that we structure based on the clients needs and investment objectives, with securities recommended by multiple institutional investment advisors according to defined investment strategies. Our clients directly own the securities in their individual portfolios, and we continuously monitor and evaluate each investment advisor and the investment performance in each portfolio. We also offer advisory services to help clients invest in a variety of mutual funds and other securities. By working in cooperation with our clients financial advisers, we seek to achieve each clients investment objectives by selecting the appropriate mutual funds. Our asset management services generally require minimum investments of $50,000. As of December 31, 2005, we managed more than $5.2 billion for more than 19,000 accounts. Our retail broker/dealers have approximately 2,400 affiliated financial professionals, who sell annuity and insurance products, including our proprietary products, as well as third party mutual funds and other investment 22 Table of Contents products. In connection with these sales, we receive commission and fee income from purchasers, and we pay a portion of the commissions and fees to financial professionals. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we offered a broad range of institutional asset management services to third parties. GE Asset Management Incorporated, or GEAM, provided the portfolio management services for this business, and we provided marketing, sales and support services. We did not acquire the institutional asset management services business from GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., or GEFAHI, but we will continue to provide services to GEAM and GEFAHI related to this asset management business, including client introduction services, asset retention services and compliance support. GEFAHI has agreed to pay us a fee of up to $10 million per year for four years to provide these services. The fee will be determined based upon the level of third party assets under the management of GEAM over the four year term. Unless renewed, this agreement will expire on December 31, 2007. As of January 1, 2004, we entered into three agreements with affiliates of GE to manage a pool of municipal guaranteed investment contracts issued by those affiliates. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to originate GIC liabilities and advise the GE affiliates regarding the investment, administration and management of their assets that support those liabilities. Under two of those agreements, we receive an administration fee of 0.165% per annum of the maximum program size for those GE affiliates, which is $15 billion. The agreements also provide for termination fees in the event of early termination at the option of either affiliate. Under a third agreement with another affiliate, we receive a management fee of 0.10% per annum of the book value of the investment contracts or similar securities issued by this affiliate after January 1, 2003, which was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2005. The fee we receive on the contracts issued by that affiliate before January 1, 2003 is based upon a pricing arrangement that varies depending upon the maturities of those contracts and that affiliates cost of capital. The book value of the contracts issued before January 1, 2003 was $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2005 and is expected to generate a weighted average fee of approximately 0.35% in 2006. We also will receive reimbursement of our operating expenses under each of these agreements. The initial term of each of the three agreements will expire December 31, 2006, and unless terminated at the option of either party, each agreement will automatically renew on January 1 of each year for successive terms of one year. Underwriting and pricing We generally do not underwrite individual lives in our annuity products, other than structured settlements and some income annuities. Instead, we price our products based upon our expected investment returns and our expectations for mortality, longevity and persistency for the group of our contractholders as a whole, taking into account mortality improvements in the general population and our historical experience. We price deferred annuities by analyzing longevity and persistency risk, volatility of expected earnings on our assets under management, and the expected time to retirement. We price our GICs using customized pricing models that estimate both expected cash flows and likely variance from those expectations caused by reallocations of assets by plan participants. We price income annuities and structured settlements using our mortality experience and assumptions regarding continued improvement in annuitant longevity, as well as assumptions regarding investment yields at the time of issue and thereafter. Competition We face significant competition in all our Retirement Income and Investments businesses. Many other companies actively compete for sales in our markets, including other major insurers, banks, other financial institutions, mutual fund and money asset management firms and specialty providers. In many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims paying ratings than we do. Many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels. The substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years has intensified pressure on margins and production levels and has increased the level of competition in many of our business lines. 23 Table of Contents Mortgage Insurance Overview Through our Mortgage Insurance segment, we offer mortgage insurance in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, Mexico and Japan. We also are exploring opportunities in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Private mortgage insurance expands homeownership opportunities by enabling borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages, which are usually defined as loans with a down payment of less than 20% of the homes value. Low down payment mortgages are sometimes also referred to as high loan to value mortgages. Mortgage insurance products increase the funds available for residential mortgages by protecting mortgage lenders and investors against loss in the event of a borrowers default. These products generally also aid financial institutions in managing their capital efficiently by reducing the capital required for low down payment mortgages. If a borrower defaults on mortgage payments, private mortgage insurance reduces and, in some instances, eliminates the loss to the insured institution. Private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. We have been providing mortgage insurance products and services in the U.S. since 1981 and now operate in all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, in 2005, we were the fifth largest provider of mortgage insurance in the U.S., based on flow new insurance written. We expanded our operations internationally throughout the 1990s and today we believe we are the largest provider of mortgage insurance outside the U.S. In 2005, we were the leading provider in Australia based upon flow new insurance written and primary insurance in force, and one of two major insurers in Canada. We are a leading private mortgage insurance provider in Europe, based upon flow new insurance written, and have a growing presence in the developing private mortgage insurance markets in Mexico and Japan. In addition to private mortgage insurance, we provide lenders with various underwriting and other products and services related to home mortgage lending. The following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our U.S. and international mortgage insurance business, as of or for the periods indicated. Additional selected financial information and operating performance measures regarding our Mortgage Insurance segment as of or for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are included under Item 7.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase residential mortgages from mortgage lenders and investors, as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. For the first nine months of 2005, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately 28.1% of all the mortgage loans originated in the U.S., as compared to 36.1% for 2004, according to statistics published by Inside the GSEs. We believe the significant reduction in the percentage of mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has reduced the market size for flow private mortgage insurance. Mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac totaled more than $3.56 trillion as of December 31, 2005, or approximately 39% of the total outstanding mortgage debt in the U.S. In connection with these activities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have established mortgage loan origination, documentation, servicing and selling requirements and standards for the loans they purchase. In addition, Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs current eligibility requirements provide that they will accept private mortgage insurance only from insurers that maintain financial strength ratings of at least AA by S&P and Aa3 by Moodys. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises, and we refer to them as the GSEs. The GSEs may purchase mortgages with unpaid principal amounts up to a specified maximum. The maximum single family principal balance loan limit eligible for purchase by the GSEs is called the conforming loan limit. It is currently $417,000 and subject to annual adjustment. Each GSEs Congressional charter generally prohibits it from purchasing a mortgage where the loan to value ratio exceeds 80% of home value unless the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of 80% of the value of the property securing the mortgage is protected against default by lender recourse, participation or by a qualified insurer. As a result, high loan to value mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured as of December 31, 2005. The majority of our U.S. mortgage insurance policies provide default loss protection on a portion (typically 10% 40%) of the balance of an individual mortgage loan. Most of our primary mortgage insurance policies are flow insurance policies, which cover individual loans at the time the loan is originated. We also enter into bulk transactions with lenders and investors in selected instances, under which we insure a portfolio of loans for a negotiated price. Bulk insurance constituted less than 2% of our new risk written for each of the years ended December 2005, 2004 and 2003. In addition to flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance business, we have written mortgage insurance on a pool basis. Under pool insurance, the mortgage insurer provides coverage on a group of specified loans, typically for 100% of all losses on every loan in the portfolio, subject to an agreed aggregate loss limit. Products and services Primary mortgage insurance Flow insurance. Flow insurance is primary mortgage insurance placed on an individual loan when the loan is originated. Our primary mortgage insurance covers default risk on first mortgage loans generally secured by one to four unit residential properties, and can be used to protect mortgage lenders and investors from default on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument that we have approved. Our insurance covers a specified coverage percentage of a claim amount consisting of unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure. As the insurer, we generally are required to pay the coverage percentage of a claim amount specified in the primary policy, but we also have the option to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure, and acquire title to the property. In addition, the claim amount may be reduced or 25 Table of Contents eliminated if the loss on the defaulted loan is reduced as a result of the lenders disposition of the property. The lender selects the coverage percentage at the time the loan is originated, often to comply with investor requirements to reduce the loss exposure on loans purchased by the investor. For a 30 year fixed rate mortgage, the most common mortgage product in the U.S., the GSEs generally require coverage percentages of 35% for loan to value ratios, determined at loan origination, of greater than 95.00%, 30% for loan to value ratios of 90.01% 95.00%, 25% for loan to value ratios of 85.01% 90.00% and 12% for loan to value ratios of 80.01% 85.00%. However, the GSEs may alter their coverage requirements and propose different product structures, and we also offer a range of other mortgage insurance products that provide greater or lesser coverage amounts. The borrowers mortgage loan instrument generally requires the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium. In other cases, no insurance requirement is imposed upon the borrower, in which case the lender pays the premium and recovers those payments through the interest rate charged on the mortgage. Our mortgage insurance premiums for flow insurance typically are paid monthly, with more than 97% of flow new insurance written during each of the last three years paid monthly, but premiums also may be paid annually or in a single, lump sum payment. We are not permitted to terminate our mortgage insurance coverage in force, except for non payment of premium or material breach of policy conditions. The insurance remains renewable at the option of the policyholder, usually at the renewal rate fixed when the loan was initially insured. As a result, we are not able to raise prices on existing policies to respond to unanticipated default patterns. In addition, our policyholders may cancel their insurance at any time at their option, including when a mortgage is repaid, which may be accelerated by mortgage refinancings in times of falling interest rates. Cancellations are primarily driven by the prevailing interest rate environment, home price appreciation trends and the cancellation policies of the GSEs and other investors. Under the U.S. Homeowners Protection Act, or the HPA, a borrower generally has the right to terminate private mortgage insurance coverage on loans closed after July 28, 1999 secured by a single dwelling property that is the borrowers primary residence when certain loan to value ratio thresholds are met. In general, a borrower may stop making mortgage insurance payments when the loan to value ratio is scheduled to reach 80% (based upon the loans amortization schedule established at loan origination) if the borrower so requests and if certain requirements relating to the borrowers payment history and the propertys value since origination are satisfied. In addition, a borrowers obligation to make payments for private mortgage insurance generally terminates regardless of whether a borrower so requests when the loan to value ratio reaches 78% of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage. Some states require mortgage servicers to notify borrowers periodically of the circumstances in which they may request a mortgage servicer to cancel private mortgage insurance. Some states allow the borrower to request that the mortgage servicer cancel private mortgage insurance or require the mortgage servicer to cancel such insurance automatically when the circumstances permitting cancellation occur. The level of new mortgage originations in the U.S. was $3,120 billion and $2,920 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. This compares to $3,945 billion of new mortgage originations for the year ended December 31, 2003. We believe the decrease in mortgage originations since 2003 was principally driven by two factors. First, increasing interest rates in 2004 and 2005 made refinancing of existing mortgages less attractive to consumers than in prior years. Second, with historically low interest rates in 2002 and 2003, many mortgages for which refinancing would otherwise have been economically attractive were already refinanced. As a result, our U.S. flow persistency increased from 46% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 65% for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. Continued interest rate increases may have a favorable impact on persistency and could have an adverse impact on new mortgage originations. If home price appreciation slows, policy cancellations may decline, which would positively affect our U.S. flow persistency rate. 26 Table of Contents We continue to develop innovative mortgage insurance products that are designed to attract first time home buyers and expand the scope of the traditional mortgage insurance market. For example, we have launched our HomeOpeners&reg; products: MonthlyPlus, PaymentPlus and LenderPlus. Our MonthlyPlus product combines a mortgage insurance policy with involuntary unemployment coverage on mortgage payments for a specified period of time in the event of involuntary job loss or accidental death. Our PaymentPlus and LenderPlus products are designed to compete with simultaneous second mortgages, as described below under Competition Mortgage lenders and other investors. Bulk insurance Under our primary bulk insurance, we insure a portfolio of loans in a single, bulk transaction. Generally, in our bulk insurance, the individual loans in the insured portfolio are insured to specified levels of coverage, and there is an aggregate loss limit applicable to all of the insured loans. We base the premium on our bulk insurance upon our evaluation of the overall risk of the insured loans included in a transaction, and we negotiate the premium directly with the securitizer or other owner of the loans. Most of our bulk insurance business through 2005 has related to loans financed by lenders who participate in the mortgage programs sponsored by the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). In addition to the FHLB business, we also participate in Alt A programs with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns. Premiums for bulk transactions generally are paid monthly by lenders or investors or a securitization vehicle in connection with a securitization transaction or the sale of a loan portfolio. The loans we insure in bulk transactions typically consist of prime credit quality loans with loan to value ratios of 50% to 95%. We generally have avoided the sub prime segments of the market, because we believe market pricing for mortgage insurance on sub prime bulk transactions has not been adequate and we have had concerns regarding the volatility of this segment. However, we may consider insuring such loans where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns. Loans that we insure in bulk transactions with loan to value ratios above 80% typically have primary mortgage insurance on a flow basis, written either by us or another private mortgage insurer. Our mortgage insurance coverage levels in bulk transactions typically range from 10% to 40%. Pool insurance In addition to our flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance, we previously have written mortgage insurance on a pool basis. Pool insurance generally is used as an additional credit enhancement for secondary market mortgage transactions. We ceased writing pool insurance in 1993 because of relatively high losses on pool policies, resulting primarily from inadequate pricing, loss severity and risk concentration in certain parts of the country. However in 2005, we began writing pool insurance for state housing finance agencies where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns. Our pool insurance in force, which relates primarily to policies written between 1990 and 1993, generally covers the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds either the claim payment under the primary coverage (if primary insurance is required on that loan) or the total loss (if that loan does not require primary insurance), in each case up to a stated aggregate loss limit. Mortgage loans we insured in pool insurance with loan to value ratios above 80% typically are covered by flow mortgage insurance, written either by us or another private mortgage insurer. Contract underwriting services We perform fee based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. Historically, lenders and mortgage insurers each maintained underwriting staffs and performed separate, and in many ways duplicative, underwriting activities with respect to each mortgage loan. Over time, lenders and mortgage insurers have developed a number of arrangements designed to eliminate those inefficiencies. The provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers serves this purpose and speeds the approval process. 27 Table of Contents The principal contract underwriting service we provide is determining whether the data relating to a borrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lenders loan underwriting guidelines or the investors loan purchase requirements. In connection with that service, we also compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements. If the loan being reviewed requires mortgage insurance under the applicable lender or investor criteria, we also underwrite the loan to our mortgage insurance guidelines and issue the appropriate mortgage insurance coverage. We believe our contract underwriting services appeal to mortgage lenders because they enable lenders to reduce their costs and improve their operating efficiencies. Under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations on liability. New risk written by our contract underwriters represented 24% of our new risk written for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 24% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Captive reinsurance Captive reinsurance is a reinsurance program in which we share portions of our U.S. mortgage insurance risk written on loans originated or purchased by lenders with captive reinsurance companies, or captive reinsurers, affiliated with these lenders. In return, we cede to the captive reinsurers an agreed portion of our gross premiums on flow insurance written. New insurance written through the bulk channel generally is not subject to these arrangements. The following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our captive reinsurance arrangements, as of or for the periods indicated: As of or for the years endedDecember 31, 2005 2004 2003 Primary risk in force subject to captive reinsurance arrangements, as a percentage of total primary risk in force 65 % 66 % 64 % Gross written premiums ceded pursuant to captive reinsurance arrangements, as a percentage of total gross written premiums 24 % 24 % 23 % Primary new risk written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements, as a percentage of total primary new risk written 61 % 70 % 75 % Customers Our principal mortgage insurance customers are originators of residential mortgage loans, such as mortgage banks, savings institutions, commercial banks, mortgage brokers, credit unions and other lenders, who typically determine which mortgage insurer or insurers they will use for the placement of mortgage insurance written on loans they originate. To obtain primary insurance written on a flow basis, a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive from us a mortgage guaranty master policy. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among the largest lenders, which now underwrite a substantial portion of all the mortgages written in the U.S. Our top ten lenders accounted for an aggregate of 36% of our flow new insurance written for the year ended December 31, 2005. We are focused on expanding our presence throughout the mortgage loan market by providing superior customer sales support, product offerings designed to meet the specific needs of our customers, and technology products designed to enable customers to reduce costs and expand revenues. In addition, as discussed under 28 Table of Contents Operations and Technology, we have developed web based technology services that enable our customers to interact more efficiently with us. Underwriting and pricing Loan applications for all loans we insure are reviewed to evaluate each individual borrowers credit strength and history, the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property. This analysis generally includes reviewing the following criteria: the borrowers credit strength and history, as reported by credit reporting agencies; the borrowers debt to income ratios where income is disclosed; the loan to value ratio; the type of mortgage instrument; the purpose of the loan; the type of property; and appraisals to confirm the property market value is fairly stated. Loan applications for primary mortgage insurance are reviewed by our employees directly as part of our traditional underwriting process or by our contract underwriters as we process mortgage loan applications requiring mortgage insurance. Some mortgage lenders also underwrite loan applications for mortgage insurance under a delegated underwriting program, in which we permit approved lenders to commit us to insure loans using underwriting guidelines we have previously approved. Before granting a lender delegated underwriting authority, our risk management personnel review the lenders underwriting experience and processes, loan quality and specific loan programs to be included in the delegated program. In addition, we conduct audits on a sample of the delegated loans we insure to confirm that lenders with delegated authority adhere to approved underwriting guidelines and procedures. The majority of mortgage loans we insure today are underwritten using Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs automated underwriting systems, or AUS, which lenders have widely adopted due to the GSEs requirements and the efficiencies that AUS provide. We have evaluated loans approved by Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs AUS and, like other mortgage insurers, we generally have agreed to insure loans approved by these systems. Under the delegated underwriting program, lenders may use their own AUS provided we have reviewed and approved their system. AUS have automated many of the underwriting steps that were previously performed by underwriters on a manual basis and use sophisticated mortgage scoring methodologies to evaluate borrower default risk. Although we review AUS before allowing their use under our delegated program, under which lenders have the responsibility to determine whether the loans comply with our approved underwriting guidelines, a potential risk to us of using AUS is factors we might otherwise evaluate in making an underwriting decision are not considered if not required by AUS. Loans insured under our delegated underwriting program accounted for approximately 60% of our total risk in force as of December 31, 2005, compared to 59% as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The percentage of new risk written by delegated underwriters was 61% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 58% and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In pricing mortgage insurance policies, we generally target substantially similar returns on capital regardless of the loan to value ratio, product type and depth of coverage. We establish premium rates principally on the basis of long term claims experience in the industry, reflecting periods of lower and higher losses and various regional economic downturns. We believe over the long term each region of the U.S. will be subject to similar factors affecting risk of loss on insurance written, and, therefore, we generally use a nationally based premium rate policy, 29 Table of Contents rather than a regional, local or lender based policy. Our premium rates vary with the coverage percentage and the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan, which takes into account the loan to value ratio, the type of mortgage and the term of the mortgage. Our premium rates also reflect our expectations, based upon our analysis of historical data, of the persistency of the policies in our book of business. Our premium rates also take into account competitive alternatives available to consumers, including rates offered by other mortgage insurers. For a certain number of our products, our premium rates do vary based on the location of the borrowers credit score within a range of credit scores. In accordance with industry practice, we use the FICO score as one indicator of a borrowers credit quality. Fair Isaac and Company, or FICO, developed the FICO credit scoring model to calculate a FICO score based upon a borrowers credit history. The higher the credit score, the lower the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. FICO credit scores range up to 850, with a score of 620 or more generally viewed as a prime loan and a score below 620 generally viewed as a sub prime loan. A minus loans generally are loans where the borrowers have FICO credit scores between 575 and 660, and where the borrower has a blemished credit history. Some of our products require a minimum FICO score and or have rates based on FICO scores. As of December 31, 2005, on a risk in force basis, approximately 92% of our flow insurance loans had FICO credit scores of at least 620, approximately 6% had FICO credit scores between 575 and 619, and approximately 2% had FICO scores of 574 or less. As of December 31, 2005, on a risk in force basis, approximately 96% of our bulk insurance loans had FICO credit scores of at least 620, approximately 2% had FICO credit scores between 575 and 619, and approximately 2% had FICO scores of 574 or less. The majority of loans we currently insure in bulk transactions meet the conforming loan limit and have FICO credit scores of at least 620. After 2001, we significantly reduced writing insurance of loans in bulk transactions that included non conforming and lesser quality loans, such as A minus loans and sub prime loans, because we believe market pricing was inadequate to compensate us for the risk. We also provide mortgage insurance for Alt A loans, which are originated under programs in which there is a reduced level of verification or disclosure of the borrowers income or assets. For an Alt A loan, the borrowers credit strength and history and the appraised value of the property are carefully reviewed. We also impose limitations on Alt A loans, including limitations with respect to the purpose of the loan and the type of property. Alt A loans represented 5.1%, 2.8% and 1.9% of our risk in force as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We also provide insurance for loans with an initial Interest Only payment option. The Interest Only payment option allows the borrower flexibility to pay interest only, or to pay interest and as much principal as desired, during an initial period of time. We impose credit score, occupancy type and loan to value restrictions on these loans. Interest Only loans represented 3.3% of our U.S. risk in force as of December 31, 2005 and 1.0% or less as of December 31, 2004 and prior. 30 Table of Contents Loan portfolio The following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our U.S. primary mortgage insurance loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Primary risk in force lender concentration (by original applicant) $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Top 10 lenders 8,608 9,755 12,047 Top 20 lenders 10,983 11,938 14,392 Loan to value ratio 95.01% and above $ 4,105 $ 3,601 $ 3,431 90.01% to 95.00% 8,362 9,450 10,759 80.01% to 90.00% 8,859 9,555 10,868 80.00% and below 412 363 747 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Loan grade Prime $ 19,482 $ 20,704 $ 23,408 A minus and sub prime 2,256 2,265 2,397 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Loan type(1) Fixed rate mortgage $ 20,325 $ 21,492 $ 24,354 Adjustable rate mortgage 1,413 1,477 1,451 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Type of documentation Alt A $ 1,104 $ 633 $ 503 Standard 20,634 22,336 25,302 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Mortgage term 15 years and under $ 737 $ 1,163 $ 1,489 More than 15 years 21,001 21,806 24,316 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 (1) For loan type in this table, any loan with an interest rate that is fixed for an initial term of five years or more is categorized as a fixed rate mortgage. Loans in default and claims Our default management process begins with notification by the loan servicer of a default on an insured loan. Default is defined in our master policies as the borrowers failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage. Generally, the master policies require an insured to notify us of a default no later than ten days after the borrower has been in default by three monthly payments. In most cases, however, defaults are reported earlier. We generally consider a loan to be in default and establish reserves if the borrower has failed to make a required mortgage payment for two consecutive months. Borrowers default for a variety of reasons, including a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit and interest rate levels. Borrowers may cure defaults by making all of the delinquent loan payments or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In most cases, defaults that are not cured result in a claim under our policy. 31 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the number of loans insured, the number of loans in default and the default rate for our U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio: December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Primary Insurance Insured loans in force 744,970 830,688 950,157 Loans in default 27,391 28,467 32,207 Percentage of loans in default (default rate) 3.7 % 3.4 % 3.4 % Flow loans in force 643,954 719,533 839,891 Flow loans in default 26,163 26,737 29,787 Percentage of flow loans in default (default rate) 4.1 % 3.7 % 3.5 % Bulk loans in force 101,016 111,155 110,266 Bulk loans in default 1,228 1,730 2,420 Percentage of bulk loans in default (default rate) 1.2 % 1.6 % 2.2 % A minus and sub prime loans in force 67,514 69,817 75,584 A minus and sub prime loans in default 7,072 7,068 6,881 Percentage of A minus and sub prime loans in default (default rate) 10.5 % 10.1 % 9.1 % Pool Insurance Insured loans in force 19,524 25,303 37,702 Loans in default 597 777 855 Percentage of loans in default (default rate) 3.1 % 3.1 % 2.3 % Primary insurance default rates differ from region to region in the U.S. at any one time depending upon economic conditions and cyclical growth patterns. The two tables below set forth our primary default rates for the various regions of the U.S. and the ten largest states by our risk in force as of December 31, 2005. Default rates are shown by region based upon location of the underlying property, rather than the location of the lender. We believe that increases in the 2005 default rates for the South Central and Southeast regions reflect increased delinquencies associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, this did not have a material impact to our 2005 results of operations.

Based upon our experience, the majority of claims on primary mortgage insurance loans occur in the third through seventh years after loan origination, and relatively few claims are paid during the first two years after loan origination. Primary insurance written from the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2002 represented 18% of our primary insurance in force as of December 31, 2005. This portion of our loan portfolio is in its expected peak claim period with respect to traditional primary loans. We believe our A minus and sub prime loans will have earlier incidences of default than our prime loans. A minus loans represented 4.8% and 4.4% of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and sub prime loans represented 5.6% and 5.5% of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table sets forth the dispersion of our primary insurance in force and risk in force as of December 31, 2005, by year of policy origination and average annual mortgage interest rate since we began operations in 1981: (Dollar amounts in millions) Average rate Primary insurance in force Percent of total Primary risk in force Percent of total Policy Year 1996 and Prior 8.18 % $ 3,086 3.08 % $ 739 3.40 % 1997 7.83 % 543 0.54 147 0.67 1998 7.12 % 1,496 1.49 383 1.76 1999 7.24 % 1,727 1.72 430 1.98 2000 8.15 % 1,046 1.04 258 1.19 2001 7.38 % 3,982 3.98 964 4.43 2002 6.54 % 9,713 9.69 2,314 10.65 2003 5.62 % 34,681 34.60 6,234 28.68 2004 5.80 % 19,411 19.37 4,286 19.72 2005 5.97 % 24,545 24.49 5,983 27.52 Total portfolio 6.19 % $ 100,230 100.00 % $ 21,738 100.00 % Primary mortgage insurance claims paid, including loss adjustment expenses, or LAE, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $145 million, compared to $146 million and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pool insurance claims paid were $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The frequency of defaults may not correlate directly with the number of claims received because the rate at which defaults are cured is influenced by borrowers financial resources and circumstances and regional economic differences. Whether an uncured default leads to a claim principally depends upon the borrowers 33 Table of Contents equity at the time of default and the borrowers or the insureds ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan. When we receive notice of a default, we use a proprietary model to determine whether a delinquent loan is a candidate for work out. When the model identifies such a candidate, our loan workout specialists prioritize cases for loss mitigation based upon the likelihood that the loan will result in a claim. Loss mitigation actions include loan modification, extension of credit to bring a loan current, foreclosure forbearance, pre foreclosure sale, and deed in lieu. These loss mitigation efforts often are an effective way to reduce our claim exposure and ultimate payouts. Our policies require the insured to file a claim with us, specifying the claim amount (unpaid principal, interest and expenses), no later than 60 days after it has acquired title to the underlying property, usually through foreclosure. The claim amount is subject to our review and possible adjustment. Depending upon the applicable state foreclosure law, an average of approximately 18 months elapse from the date of default to the filing of a claim on an uncured default. Our master policies exclude coverage where there is physical damage whether caused by fire, earthquake or other catastrophe, unless the property is restored to its condition at the time the insurance was placed, with reasonable wear and tear excepted. We have the right to rescind coverage and refuse to pay a claim if it is determined that the insured or its agents misrepresented material information in the insurance application. In addition, where loans are underwritten by lenders through our delegated underwriting program, we have the right to rescind coverage if the loan was not underwritten in compliance with our approved guidelines. Within 60 days after a claim and supporting documentation have been filed, we have the option: to pay the claim amount, multiplied by coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance; in the event the property is sold pursuant to an agreement made prior to payment of the claim, which we refer to as a pre arranged sale, to pay the lesser of 100% of the claim amount less the proceeds of sale of the property, or the claim amount multiplied by the coverage percentage; or to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure, and acquire title to the property. We bear the risk of any loss in connection with the acquisition and sale of the property. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we settled approximately 50% of the primary insurance claims processed for payment on the basis of a pre arranged sale. The ratio of the claim paid to the current risk in force for a loan is referred to as claim severity. The current aggregate risk in force is equal to the unpaid principal amount multiplied by the coverage percentage. The main determinants of claim severity are the age of the mortgage loan, the value of the underlying property, accrued interest on the loan, expenses advanced by the insured and foreclosure expenses. These amounts depend partly upon the time required to complete foreclosure, which varies depending upon state laws. Pre foreclosure sales, acquisitions and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall claim severity. Our average primary mortgage insurance claim severity was 95%, 94% and 93% for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Competition We compete primarily with U.S. and state government agencies, other private mortgage insurers, mortgage lenders and other investors, the GSEs and, potentially, the Federal Home Loan Banks. We also compete, indirectly, with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate credit risk. U.S. and state government agencies. We and other private mortgage insurers compete for flow business directly with U.S. federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies, principally the FHA and, to a lesser degree, the VA. In the aggregate, the FHA and VA had a 23.5% market share in 2005 and a 32.8% market share in 2004, according to information published by Inside Mortgage Finance. 34 Table of Contents Loans insured by the FHA cannot exceed maximum principal amounts that are determined by a percentage of the conforming loan limit. For 2006, the maximum FHA loan amount for homes with one dwelling unit in high cost areas is $362,790 and the maximum VA loan amount is $417,000. We and other private mortgage insurers are not limited as to maximum individual loan amounts we can insure. In addition to competition from the FHA and the VA, we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from state supported mortgage insurance funds in several states, including California, Illinois and New York. From time to time, other state legislatures and agencies consider expansions of the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages. Government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do. Although private companies establish pricing terms for their products to achieve targeted returns, these government entities may offer products on terms designed to accomplish social or political objectives or reflect other non economic goals. Private mortgage insurers. The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. The private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of seven mortgage insurers plus our company. Mortgage lenders and other investors. We and other mortgage insurers compete with transactions structured by mortgage lenders to avoid mortgage insurance on low down payment mortgage loans. These transactions include self insuring and simultaneous second loans, which separate a mortgage with a loan to value ratio of more than 80%, which generally would require mortgage insurance, into two loans, a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio of 80% and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan. Simultaneous second loans are also often known as 80 10 10 loans, because they often comprise a first mortgage with an 80% loan to value ratio, a second mortgage with a 10% loan to value ratio and the remaining 10% paid in cash by the buyer, rather than a single mortgage with a 90% loan to value ratio. However, simultaneous seconds also can be structured as 80 15 5 loans or 80 20 0 loans, as well as other configurations. Over the past several years, we believe the volume of simultaneous second loans as an alternative to loans requiring private mortgage insurance has increased substantially. We believe this recent increase reflects the following factors: the lower cost of simultaneous second loans compared to the cost of mortgage insurance, due to the current low interest rate environment and the emerging popularity of 15 and 30 year amortizing and adjustable rate simultaneous seconds; the fact that second mortgage interest is generally tax deductible, whereas mortgage insurance payments currently are not tax deductible (although from time to time there have been proposed legislative initiatives to permit deductions for mortgage insurance payments); negative consumer, broker and realtor perceptions of private mortgage insurance; and the desire by some investors to hold second mortgages. We are developing mortgage insurance products that seek to enhance the appeal of private mortgage insurance in view of the increasing volume of simultaneous second loans. For example, in 2004, we launched our HomeOpeners&reg; suite of products designed to compete more effectively with simultaneous second loans by offering consumers lower monthly payments, more deductible interest and involuntary job loss protection at no additional cost. Mortgage lenders also may compete with mortgage insurers as a result of legislation that has removed restrictions on affiliations between banks and insurers. The Graham Leach Bliley Act of 1999 permits the combination of banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company. This legislation may increase competition by increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. In addition, mortgage lenders that establish or affiliate with competing mortgage insurers may reduce their purchases of our products. 35 Table of Contents We also compete with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults, such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes, with lenders who forego mortgage insurance (self insure) on loans held in their portfolios, and with mortgage lenders who maintain captive mortgage insurance and reinsurance programs. The GSEs Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and The Federal Home Loans Banks. As the predominant purchasers of conventional mortgage loans in the U.S., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide a direct link between mortgage origination and capital markets. As discussed above under Primary mortgage insurance, most high loan to value mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are insured with private mortgage insurance issued by an insurer deemed qualified by the GSEs. Our mortgage insurance company is a qualified insurer with both GSEs. Private mortgage insurers may be subject to competition from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the extent the GSEs are compensated for assuming default risk that would otherwise be insured by the private mortgage insurance industry. The GSEs are currently subject to oversight by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD. In November 2004, HUD announced new GSE mortgage purchase requirements, known as affordable housing goals. Under these goals, which became effective January 1, 2005, the minimum percent of all loans purchased by the GSEs that must support low and moderate income home buyers increases annually from 50% in 2004 to 56% in 2008, and the minimum percent of such loans that must be on properties in underserved areas increases annually from 36% in 2004 to 39% in 2008. The GSEs goals to expand purchases of affordable housing loans may increase the size of the mortgage insurance market. The GSEs also have expanded programs to include commitments to purchase certain volumes of loans with loan to value ratios greater than 95%. Private mortgage insurers must satisfy requirements set by the GSEs to be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs, and the GSEs have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers. They also have the authority to change the pricing arrangements for purchasing retained participation mortgages as compared to insured mortgages, increase or reduce required mortgage insurance coverage percentages, and alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase. In addition to the GSEs, the Federal Home Loan Banks, or FHLBs, purchase single family conforming mortgage loans. Although not required to do so, the FHLBs currently use mortgage insurance on substantially all mortgage loans with a loan to value ratio above 80%. International mortgage insurance We have significant mortgage insurance operations in Australia and Canada, two of the largest markets for mortgage insurance products outside the U.S., as well as smaller operations in New Zealand and the developing markets in Europe, Mexico and Japan. The net premiums written in our international mortgage insurance business have increased by a compound annual growth rate of 32% for the three years ended December 31, 2005. Insurance in force for our international mortgage insurance business contributed 71% of our total insurance in force as of December 31, 2005 compared to 64% as of December 31, 2004 and 53% as of December 31, 2003. In addition, earnings from our international mortgage insurance business represented 53%, 47% and 39% of our mortgage insurance net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 37% from 2003 to 2005. The mortgage loan markets in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand are well developed. Although mortgage insurance plays an important role in each of these markets, the markets vary significantly and are influenced in large part by the different cultural, economic and regulatory conditions in each market. We believe the following factors have contributed to the growth of robust mortgage insurance demand in these countries: a desire by lenders to offer low down payment mortgage loans to facilitate the expansion of their business; 36 Table of Contents the recognition of the higher default risk inherent in low down payment lending and the need for specialized underwriting expertise to conduct this business prudently; government housing policies that support increased homeownership; government policies that support the use of securitization and secondary market mortgage sales, in which third party credit enhancement is often used, as a source of funding and liquidity for mortgage lending; and bank regulatory capital policies that provide incentives to lenders to transfer some or all of the increased credit risk on low down payment mortgages to third parties, such as mortgage insurers. We believe a number of these factors are becoming evident in certain markets throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia and provide opportunities for us to expand our mortgage insurance business in those markets. Based upon our experience in the mature markets, we believe a favorable regulatory framework is important to the development of an environment in which lenders routinely extend high loan to value loans and use products such as mortgage insurance to protect against default risk or obtain capital relief. As a result, we have advocated governmental and policymaking agencies throughout our markets adopt legislative and regulatory policies supporting increased homeownership and capital relief for lenders and mortgage investors that insure their loan portfolios with private mortgage insurance. Although the products we offer in each of our international markets differ, they represent substantially similar risk propositions and involve similar business practices. We have developed significant expertise in mature markets, and we leverage this experience in developing markets as we continue to encourage regulatory authorities to implement incentives for private mortgage insurance as an effective risk management strategy. We believe the revisions to a set of regulatory rules and procedures governing global bank capital standards that were introduced by the Basel Committee of the Bank for International Settlements, known as Basel II, also may encourage further growth of international mortgage insurance. Basel II has been designed to reward banks that have developed effective risk management systems by allowing them to hold less capital than banks with less effective systems. For example, Basel II may reward a lender that transfers some risk of mortgage default to a third party insurer by reducing the amount of capital that the lender must hold to back a mortgage. Basel II was finalized and issued in June 2004; however, its adoption by individual countries is ongoing. Therefore, we cannot predict the benefits that ultimately will be provided to lenders, or how any such benefits may affect the opportunities for the growth of mortgage insurance. Under proposed rules released by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) during 2005 in connection with the Basel II framework, certain approved deposit taking institutions (ADIs) in Australia would be required to hold less capital on high loan to value mortgage loans and would also receive a capital incentive for using mortgage insurance, but at a reduced level when compared to current regulations in Australia. APRA has also proposed that ADIs would need to acquire mortgage insurance coverage levels lower than existing requirements in order to obtain these reduced capital incentives. We continue to work with APRA on this proposed rulemaking, which is expected to become effective January 1, 2008. If the final rules retain these provisions, lenders in Australia may be able to reduce their use of mortgage insurance for high loan to value ratio mortgages, which may have an adverse affect on our Australian business. Certain markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia have strong demand for housing, but are underserved by the existing housing finance systems. As a result, we believe that mortgage insurance could enhance the overall scale, effectiveness and efficiency of these mortgage markets. We expect lenders in these countries will seek to expand their consumer mortgage loan portfolios, while maintaining strong risk and capital management routines. With the expected implementation of the new Basel II standards, we believe we will be well positioned to assist lenders in these markets in meeting those goals and in complying with the anticipated complexity of the risk based capital and operating standards. 37 Table of Contents Canada We entered the Canadian mortgage insurance market in 1995 with our acquisition of certain assets and employees from the Mortgage Insurance Corporation of Canada, and we now operate in every province and territory. We are currently the only private mortgage insurer in the Canadian market, although other companies have recently applied for a license to sell mortgage insurance in Canada. Products We offer two products in Canada: primary flow insurance and portfolio credit enhancement insurance. Our principal product is primary flow insurance, which is similar to the primary flow insurance we offer in the U.S. Regulations in Canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks, trust companies and insurers, where the loan to value ratio exceeds 75%. Mortgage insurance in Canada is typically single premium and provides 100% coverage, in contrast to the U.S., where monthly premiums and lower coverage levels are typical. Under the single premium plan, lenders usually include the single premium as a part of the aggregate loan amount and pay a single premium to us as the mortgage insurer. We, in turn, record the proceeds to unearned premium reserves, invest those proceeds and recognize the premiums over time in accordance with the expected expiration of risk. We also provide portfolio credit enhancement insurance to lenders that have originated loans with loan to value ratios of less than 75%. These policies provide lenders with immediate capital relief from applicable bank regulatory capital requirements and facilitate the securitization of mortgages in the Canadian market. In both primary flow insurance and portfolio policies, our mortgage insurance in Canada provides insurance coverage for the entire unpaid loan balance, including interest, selling costs and expenses, following the sale of the underlying property. The leading mortgage product in the Canadian market is a mortgage with the interest rate fixed for the first five years of the loan. After the fifth year, the loan becomes due and payable and the borrower must negotiate its renewal, at which time the borrower may choose to have the interest rate float or have it fixed for an additional period. Lenders typically charge a mortgage pre payment penalty that serves as a disincentive for borrowers to refinance their mortgages. Changes in interest rates, adverse economic conditions and high levels of borrowing affect the frequency of defaults and claims with respect to these loans, which may adversely affect our loss experience. Regulations in Canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks, trust, companies and insurers with loan to value ratios greater than 75%. In February 2005, as part of a periodic review of the federal financial services regulatory framework, the Canadian Department of Finance issued a consultation document seeking comment on a wide variety of potential initiatives relating to the regulation of financial services, including whether to remove the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance on all loans with loan to value ratios greater than 75%. The removal of the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance, in whole or in part, may result in a reduction in the amount of business we write in future years in Canada. See Regulation Mortgage Insurance International Regulation Canada. Government guarantee We have an agreement with the Canadian government under which it guarantees the benefits payable under a mortgage insurance policy, less 10% of the original principal amount of an insured loan, in the event that we fail to make claim payments with respect to that loan because of insolvency. We pay the Canadian government a risk premium for this guarantee and make other payments to a reserve fund in respect of the governments obligation. Because banks are not required to maintain regulatory capital on an asset backed by a sovereign guarantee, our 90% sovereign guarantee permits lenders purchasing our mortgage insurance to reduce their regulatory capital charges for credit risks on mortgages by 90%. 38 Table of Contents Customers The nine largest mortgage originators in Canada, consisting of banks, trust companies, and credit unions, collectively provide more than 80% of the financing for Canadas residential mortgage financing. The nine largest originators in each of the past three years provided us with 83%, 87% and 85% of our new insurance written for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other market participants include regional banks, trust companies, and credit unions. Competitors Currently, the only other mortgage insurance competitor in Canada is the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, or CMHC, which is a Crown corporation owned by the Canadian government. Because CMHC is a government owned entity, its mortgage insurance provides lenders with 100% capital relief from bank regulatory requirements. We compete with CMHC primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service, quick decision making on insurance applications, strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development. In April 2005, the CMHC announced a 15% rate reduction for loans with a loan to value ratio exceeding 90%, which we have matched. Rate reductions or other actions taken by the CMHC to reduce rates or compete with us in other ways may cause our revenue in our Canadian mortgage insurance business to decline. In addition, as in other markets, we compete in Canada with alternative products and financial structures, such as credit default swaps, which are designed to transfer credit default risk on mortgage loans. Australia and New Zealand We entered the Australian mortgage insurance market in 1997 with our acquisition of the operating assets of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, or HLIC, from the Australian government. We entered the New Zealand mortgage insurance market in 1999 as an expansion of our Australian operations. Products In Australia and New Zealand, we offer primary flow insurance, known as lenders mortgage insurance, or LMI, and portfolio credit enhancement policies. Our principal product is LMI, which is similar to the primary flow insurance we offer in Canada, with single premiums and 100% coverage. Lenders usually collect the single premium from prospective borrowers at the time the loan proceeds are advanced and remit the amount to us as the mortgage insurer. We in turn record the proceeds to unearned premium reserves, invest those proceeds and recognize the premiums over time in accordance with the expected expiration of risk. We provide LMI on a flow basis to two types of customers: banks, building societies and credit unions; and non bank mortgage originators, called mortgage managers. Banks, building societies and credit unions generally acquire LMI only for residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios above 80%. Under APRA requirements, effective January 1, 2006, reduced capital requirements apply to high loan to value residential mortgages only if they have been insured by a mortgage insurance company that is regulated by APRA or is subject to comparable regulation in its home jurisdiction and is otherwise acceptable to APRA. After October 1, 2004, non standard loans with a loan to value ratio above 60% are entitled to a reduced capital requirement only if they meet strict requirements as established by APRA or are insured by a qualified LMI. APRAs regulations currently require APRA regulated lenders to determine the criteria for determining if a loan is a non standard type loan. Our insurance subsidiary that serves the Australian and New Zealand markets has financial strength ratings of AA (Very Strong) from S&P and Fitch and a rating of Aa2 (Excellent) from Moodys. The AA rating is the third highest of S&Ps 20 ratings categories and the third highest of Fitchs 24 ratings categories. The Aa2 rating is the third highest of Moodys 21 ratings categories. Mortgage managers fund their operations primarily through the issuance of mortgage backed securities. Because they are not regulated by APRA, they do not have the same capital incentives as banks for acquiring 39 Table of Contents LMI. However, they use LMI as the principal form of credit enhancement for these securities and generally purchase insurance for every loan they originate, without regard to the loan to value ratio. We also provide portfolio credit enhancement policies to APRA regulated lenders that have originated loans for securitization in the Australian market. Portfolio mortgage insurance serves as an important source of credit enhancement for the Australian securitization market, and our portfolio credit enhancement coverage generally is purchased for low loan to value, seasoned loans written by APRA regulated institutions. To date, a market for these portfolio credit enhancement policies has not developed in New Zealand to the same extent as in Australia. In both primary LMI and portfolio credit enhancement policies, our mortgage insurance provides insurance coverage for the entire unpaid loan balance, including selling costs and expenses, following the sale of the security property. Most of the loans we insure in Australia and New Zealand are variable rate mortgages with loan terms of between 20 and 30 years. In connection with our acquisition of the operating assets of HLIC in 1997, we agreed to service a mortgage insurance portfolio that was retained by the Australian government. We receive a small amount of management fees for handling claims and providing loss mitigation and related services, but we did not acquire HLICs originated insurance policies and do not bear any risk on those policies. Customers The ten largest mortgage originators in Australia, consisting of banks and mortgage managers, collectively provide more than 80% of Australias and New Zealands residential mortgage financing. The ten largest originators in each of the past three years provided us with 67% of our new insurance written for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 78% for 2004 and 2003. Other market participants in Australian and New Zealand mortgage lending include regional banks, building societies and credit unions. Competitors The Australian and New Zealand flow mortgage insurance markets currently are served by one other independent LMI company, as well as various lender affiliated captive mortgage insurance companies. We compete primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service, quick decision making on insurance applications, strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development. As in Canada, our products also compete in Australia and New Zealand with alternative products and financial structures that are designed to transfer credit default risk on mortgage loans. We believe other U.S. mortgage insurance providers are considering opportunities in Australia. APRAs license conditions require Australian mortgage insurance companies, including ours, to be mono line insurers, which are insurance companies that offer just one type of insurance product. Europe We began our European operations in the U.K., which is Europes largest market for mortgage loan originations. We expanded into six additional countries and we continue to explore opportunities in other European countries. Mortgage insurance originating in the U.K. accounted for approximately 42% of our European mortgage insurance in force as of December 31, 2005 as compared to 54% as of December 31, 2004. This large concentration in the U.K. is attributable primarily to the fact that we have been operating in that country considerably longer than in any other European country. Our growth in other European countries has helped to diversify our risk. Products Our European business currently consists principally of primary flow insurance on adjustable rate mortgages. As is the case in our other non U.S. markets, most primary flow insurance policies written in Europe 40 Table of Contents are structured with single premium payments. Our primary flow insurance generally provides first loss coverage in the event of default on a portion (typically 10% 20%) of the balance of an individual mortgage loan. We believe that, over time, there is an opportunity to provide additional products with higher coverage percentages to reduce the risks to lenders of low down payment lending to levels similar to those in more mature mortgage insurance markets. We also recently began offering portfolio credit enhancement policies to lenders that have originated loans for securitization in select European markets. Customers As a result of our strategy to expand organically into new markets in Europe with attractive growth potential, we have diversified our risk among seven countries, thereby reducing our historical concentration in the U.K. Our portfolio of international mortgage insurance in force in Europe is concentrated in the countries where we have been active for the longest period of time and with customers with whom we have been doing business for the longest period of time. We expect this concentration to diminish over time. Our customers are primarily banks and mortgage investors, and our largest customer in Europe represented 26% of our new insurance written for the year ended December 31, 2005. Competitors Our European business faces competition from both traditional mortgage insurance companies as well as providers of alternative credit enhancement products. Our competitors are both public and private entities. Public mortgage guarantee facilities exist in a number of countries, which may compete with our products. We also face competition from some of our U.S. private mortgage competitors as well as multi line insurers primarily in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. We also face competition from alternative credit enhancement products, such as personal guarantees on high loan to value loans, second mortgages and bank guarantees, and captive insurance companies organized by lenders. Lenders also have sought other forms of risk transfer, such as the use of capital market solutions through credit derivatives. In addition, some European lenders have chosen to price for and retain the additional credit risk, effectively self insuring their low down payment loans. We believe that our global expertise, coverage flexibility, and strong ratings provide a very valuable offering compared with competitors and alternative products.

The table above presents effective risk in force, which recognizes the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property. Effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor that represents our highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of our businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. As of December 31, 2005, this factor was 35%. Loans in default and claims The claim process in our international mortgage insurance business is similar to the process we follow in our U.S. mortgage insurance business. See Mortgage Insurance U.S. mortgage insurance Loans in default and claims. The following table sets forth the number of loans insured, the number of loans in default and the default rate for our international mortgage insurance portfolio: December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Primary insurance Insured loans in force 1,910,964 1,591,485 1,282,731 Loans in default 7,091 5,304 4,926 Percentage of loans in default (default rate) 0.4 % 0.3 % 0.4 % Flow loans in force 1,627,587 1,346,035 1,044,131 Flow loans in default 6,866 5,084 4,679 Percentage of flow loans in default (default rate) 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % Portfolio credit enhancement loans in force 283,377 245,450 238,600 Portfolio credit enhancement loans in default 225 220 247 Percentage of portfolio credit enhancement loans in default (default rate) 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Corporate and Other Our Corporate and Other segment consists of net realized investment gains (losses), and unallocated corporate income and expenses (including amounts accrued in settlement of class action lawsuits), interest, and other financing expenses that are incurred at our holding company level. This segment also includes the results of our subsidiaries Viking Insurance Company LTD. (Viking), GE Seguros (Seguros) and other small, non core businesses that are managed outside our operating segments. Beginning in 2006, Seguros will be managed within our Protection segment as part of the payment protection business. Viking is a Bermuda based reinsurer primarily of leased equipment insurance and consumer credit insurance underwritten by American Bankers Insurance Company, or ABIC. GE Commercial Finance, formerly known as Vendor Financial Services, purchased property and casualty insurance from ABIC on behalf of certain of its lessees to cover leased equipment. ABIC then reinsured those policies with Viking. GE Consumer Finance, formerly Card Services, develops and markets credit insurance through credit card issuers, retailers and banks. These credit insurance policies also are underwritten by ABIC and then reinsured with Viking. GE Commercial Finance ceased purchasing new insurance coverage on behalf of lessees through ABIC, as of March 1, 2004, and GE Consumer Finance intends to phase out marketing credit insurance over the next several years. GE Capital has agreed to take all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the relevant existing insurance and reinsurance relationships, but we expect Vikings reinsurance programs with GE Consumer Finance and GE Commercial Finance to decline steadily over the next several years and, ultimately, be discontinued. With respect to GE Consumer Finances credit insurance, GE Capital may decide to encourage a switch of existing coverages to another program. In that event, GE Capital has agreed to pay Viking an amount equal to the net underwriting income Viking is projected to receive as reinsurer from the date of discontinuation of any credit insurance program through December 31, 2008. 42 Table of Contents Viking also has an in force block of reinsurance of U.S. and Canadian consumer auto warranties and property and casualty gap insurance that protects consumers from the risk of loss on any difference between the value of an automobile and any loans secured by it. We do not intend to enter into any new warranty of gap insurance reinsurance treaties, and the existing treaties are in run off, with the remaining program expiring gradually through 2008. Seguros, is a small Mexican domiciled multi line insurer. We acquired this business in 1995 and currently hold 99.6% of its outstanding shares. Seguros is licensed to sell property and casualty, life and health insurance in Mexico. Seguros currently writes primarily motor vehicle coverage for personal and commercial domestic vehicles and personal coverage for tourist vehicles. It also writes a small amount of homeowners, commercial property, transport and life insurance. Seguros distributes its products through independent agents in Mexico and, for the tourist auto business, it also distributes its products through agents located in key U.S. border locations. Seguros maintains agency relationships through its branch offices in major Mexican cities. Viking and Seguros had aggregate net earnings of $28 million, $44 million, and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase residential mortgages from mortgage lenders and investors, as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. For the first nine months of 2005, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately 28.1% of all the mortgage loans originated in the U.S., as compared to 36.1% for 2004, according to statistics published by Inside the GSEs. We believe the significant reduction in the percentage of mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has reduced the market size for flow private mortgage insurance. Mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac totaled more than $3.56 trillion as of December 31, 2005, or approximately 39% of the total outstanding mortgage debt in the U.S. In connection with these activities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have established mortgage loan origination, documentation, servicing and selling requirements and standards for the loans they purchase. In addition, Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs current eligibility requirements provide that they will accept private mortgage insurance only from insurers that maintain financial strength ratings of at least AA by S&P and Aa3 by Moodys. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises, and we refer to them as the GSEs. The GSEs may purchase mortgages with unpaid principal amounts up to a specified maximum. The maximum single family principal balance loan limit eligible for purchase by the GSEs is called the conforming loan limit. It is currently $417,000 and subject to annual adjustment. Each GSEs Congressional charter generally prohibits it from purchasing a mortgage where the loan to value ratio exceeds 80% of home value unless the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of 80% of the value of the property securing the mortgage is protected against default by lender recourse, participation or by a qualified insurer. As a result, high loan to value mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured as of December 31, 2005. The majority of our U.S. mortgage insurance policies provide default loss protection on a portion (typically 10% 40%) of the balance of an individual mortgage loan. Most of our primary mortgage insurance policies are flow insurance policies, which cover individual loans at the time the loan is originated. We also enter into bulk transactions with lenders and investors in selected instances, under which we insure a portfolio of loans for a negotiated price. Bulk insurance constituted less than 2% of our new risk written for each of the years ended December 2005, 2004 and 2003. In addition to flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance business, we have written mortgage insurance on a pool basis. Under pool insurance, the mortgage insurer provides coverage on a group of specified loans, typically for 100% of all losses on every loan in the portfolio, subject to an agreed aggregate loss limit. Products and services Primary mortgage insurance Flow insurance. Flow insurance is primary mortgage insurance placed on an individual loan when the loan is originated. Our primary mortgage insurance covers default risk on first mortgage loans generally secured by one to four unit residential properties, and can be used to protect mortgage lenders and investors from default on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument that we have approved. Our insurance covers a specified coverage percentage of a claim amount consisting of unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure. As the insurer, we generally are required to pay the coverage percentage of a claim amount specified in the primary policy, but we also have the option to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure, and acquire title to the property. In addition, the claim amount may be reduced or 25 Table of Contents eliminated if the loss on the defaulted loan is reduced as a result of the lenders disposition of the property. The lender selects the coverage percentage at the time the loan is originated, often to comply with investor requirements to reduce the loss exposure on loans purchased by the investor. For a 30 year fixed rate mortgage, the most common mortgage product in the U.S., the GSEs generally require coverage percentages of 35% for loan to value ratios, determined at loan origination, of greater than 95.00%, 30% for loan to value ratios of 90.01% 95.00%, 25% for loan to value ratios of 85.01% 90.00% and 12% for loan to value ratios of 80.01% 85.00%. However, the GSEs may alter their coverage requirements and propose different product structures, and we also offer a range of other mortgage insurance products that provide greater or lesser coverage amounts. The borrowers mortgage loan instrument generally requires the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium. In other cases, no insurance requirement is imposed upon the borrower, in which case the lender pays the premium and recovers those payments through the interest rate charged on the mortgage. Our mortgage insurance premiums for flow insurance typically are paid monthly, with more than 97% of flow new insurance written during each of the last three years paid monthly, but premiums also may be paid annually or in a single, lump sum payment. We are not permitted to terminate our mortgage insurance coverage in force, except for non payment of premium or material breach of policy conditions. The insurance remains renewable at the option of the policyholder, usually at the renewal rate fixed when the loan was initially insured. As a result, we are not able to raise prices on existing policies to respond to unanticipated default patterns. In addition, our policyholders may cancel their insurance at any time at their option, including when a mortgage is repaid, which may be accelerated by mortgage refinancings in times of falling interest rates. Cancellations are primarily driven by the prevailing interest rate environment, home price appreciation trends and the cancellation policies of the GSEs and other investors. Under the U.S. Homeowners Protection Act, or the HPA, a borrower generally has the right to terminate private mortgage insurance coverage on loans closed after July 28, 1999 secured by a single dwelling property that is the borrowers primary residence when certain loan to value ratio thresholds are met. In general, a borrower may stop making mortgage insurance payments when the loan to value ratio is scheduled to reach 80% (based upon the loans amortization schedule established at loan origination) if the borrower so requests and if certain requirements relating to the borrowers payment history and the propertys value since origination are satisfied. In addition, a borrowers obligation to make payments for private mortgage insurance generally terminates regardless of whether a borrower so requests when the loan to value ratio reaches 78% of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage. Some states require mortgage servicers to notify borrowers periodically of the circumstances in which they may request a mortgage servicer to cancel private mortgage insurance. Some states allow the borrower to request that the mortgage servicer cancel private mortgage insurance or require the mortgage servicer to cancel such insurance automatically when the circumstances permitting cancellation occur. The level of new mortgage originations in the U.S. was $3,120 billion and $2,920 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. This compares to $3,945 billion of new mortgage originations for the year ended December 31, 2003. We believe the decrease in mortgage originations since 2003 was principally driven by two factors. First, increasing interest rates in 2004 and 2005 made refinancing of existing mortgages less attractive to consumers than in prior years. Second, with historically low interest rates in 2002 and 2003, many mortgages for which refinancing would otherwise have been economically attractive were already refinanced. As a result, our U.S. flow persistency increased from 46% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 65% for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. Continued interest rate increases may have a favorable impact on persistency and could have an adverse impact on new mortgage originations. If home price appreciation slows, policy cancellations may decline, which would positively affect our U.S. flow persistency rate. 26 Table of Contents We continue to develop innovative mortgage insurance products that are designed to attract first time home buyers and expand the scope of the traditional mortgage insurance market. For example, we have launched our HomeOpeners&reg; products: MonthlyPlus, PaymentPlus and LenderPlus. Our MonthlyPlus product combines a mortgage insurance policy with involuntary unemployment coverage on mortgage payments for a specified period of time in the event of involuntary job loss or accidental death. Our PaymentPlus and LenderPlus products are designed to compete with simultaneous second mortgages, as described below under Competition Mortgage lenders and other investors. Bulk insurance Under our primary bulk insurance, we insure a portfolio of loans in a single, bulk transaction. Generally, in our bulk insurance, the individual loans in the insured portfolio are insured to specified levels of coverage, and there is an aggregate loss limit applicable to all of the insured loans. We base the premium on our bulk insurance upon our evaluation of the overall risk of the insured loans included in a transaction, and we negotiate the premium directly with the securitizer or other owner of the loans. Most of our bulk insurance business through 2005 has related to loans financed by lenders who participate in the mortgage programs sponsored by the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). In addition to the FHLB business, we also participate in Alt A programs with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns. Premiums for bulk transactions generally are paid monthly by lenders or investors or a securitization vehicle in connection with a securitization transaction or the sale of a loan portfolio. The loans we insure in bulk transactions typically consist of prime credit quality loans with loan to value ratios of 50% to 95%. We generally have avoided the sub prime segments of the market, because we believe market pricing for mortgage insurance on sub prime bulk transactions has not been adequate and we have had concerns regarding the volatility of this segment. However, we may consider insuring such loans where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns. Loans that we insure in bulk transactions with loan to value ratios above 80% typically have primary mortgage insurance on a flow basis, written either by us or another private mortgage insurer. Our mortgage insurance coverage levels in bulk transactions typically range from 10% to 40%. Pool insurance In addition to our flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance, we previously have written mortgage insurance on a pool basis. Pool insurance generally is used as an additional credit enhancement for secondary market mortgage transactions. We ceased writing pool insurance in 1993 because of relatively high losses on pool policies, resulting primarily from inadequate pricing, loss severity and risk concentration in certain parts of the country. However in 2005, we began writing pool insurance for state housing finance agencies where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns. Our pool insurance in force, which relates primarily to policies written between 1990 and 1993, generally covers the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds either the claim payment under the primary coverage (if primary insurance is required on that loan) or the total loss (if that loan does not require primary insurance), in each case up to a stated aggregate loss limit. Mortgage loans we insured in pool insurance with loan to value ratios above 80% typically are covered by flow mortgage insurance, written either by us or another private mortgage insurer. Contract underwriting services We perform fee based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. Historically, lenders and mortgage insurers each maintained underwriting staffs and performed separate, and in many ways duplicative, underwriting activities with respect to each mortgage loan. Over time, lenders and mortgage insurers have developed a number of arrangements designed to eliminate those inefficiencies. The provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers serves this purpose and speeds the approval process. 27 Table of Contents The principal contract underwriting service we provide is determining whether the data relating to a borrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lenders loan underwriting guidelines or the investors loan purchase requirements. In connection with that service, we also compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements. If the loan being reviewed requires mortgage insurance under the applicable lender or investor criteria, we also underwrite the loan to our mortgage insurance guidelines and issue the appropriate mortgage insurance coverage. We believe our contract underwriting services appeal to mortgage lenders because they enable lenders to reduce their costs and improve their operating efficiencies. Under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations on liability. New risk written by our contract underwriters represented 24% of our new risk written for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 24% and 23% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Captive reinsurance Captive reinsurance is a reinsurance program in which we share portions of our U.S. mortgage insurance risk written on loans originated or purchased by lenders with captive reinsurance companies, or captive reinsurers, affiliated with these lenders. In return, we cede to the captive reinsurers an agreed portion of our gross premiums on flow insurance written. New insurance written through the bulk channel generally is not subject to these arrangements. The following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our captive reinsurance arrangements, as of or for the periods indicated: As of or for the years endedDecember 31, 2005 2004 2003 Primary risk in force subject to captive reinsurance arrangements, as a percentage of total primary risk in force 65 % 66 % 64 % Gross written premiums ceded pursuant to captive reinsurance arrangements, as a percentage of total gross written premiums 24 % 24 % 23 % Primary new risk written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements, as a percentage of total primary new risk written 61 % 70 % 75 % Customers Our principal mortgage insurance customers are originators of residential mortgage loans, such as mortgage banks, savings institutions, commercial banks, mortgage brokers, credit unions and other lenders, who typically determine which mortgage insurer or insurers they will use for the placement of mortgage insurance written on loans they originate. To obtain primary insurance written on a flow basis, a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive from us a mortgage guaranty master policy. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among the largest lenders, which now underwrite a substantial portion of all the mortgages written in the U.S. Our top ten lenders accounted for an aggregate of 36% of our flow new insurance written for the year ended December 31, 2005. We are focused on expanding our presence throughout the mortgage loan market by providing superior customer sales support, product offerings designed to meet the specific needs of our customers, and technology products designed to enable customers to reduce costs and expand revenues. In addition, as discussed under 28 Table of Contents Operations and Technology, we have developed web based technology services that enable our customers to interact more efficiently with us. Underwriting and pricing Loan applications for all loans we insure are reviewed to evaluate each individual borrowers credit strength and history, the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property. This analysis generally includes reviewing the following criteria: the borrowers credit strength and history, as reported by credit reporting agencies; the borrowers debt to income ratios where income is disclosed; the loan to value ratio; the type of mortgage instrument; the purpose of the loan; the type of property; and appraisals to confirm the property market value is fairly stated. Loan applications for primary mortgage insurance are reviewed by our employees directly as part of our traditional underwriting process or by our contract underwriters as we process mortgage loan applications requiring mortgage insurance. Some mortgage lenders also underwrite loan applications for mortgage insurance under a delegated underwriting program, in which we permit approved lenders to commit us to insure loans using underwriting guidelines we have previously approved. Before granting a lender delegated underwriting authority, our risk management personnel review the lenders underwriting experience and processes, loan quality and specific loan programs to be included in the delegated program. In addition, we conduct audits on a sample of the delegated loans we insure to confirm that lenders with delegated authority adhere to approved underwriting guidelines and procedures. The majority of mortgage loans we insure today are underwritten using Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs automated underwriting systems, or AUS, which lenders have widely adopted due to the GSEs requirements and the efficiencies that AUS provide. We have evaluated loans approved by Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs AUS and, like other mortgage insurers, we generally have agreed to insure loans approved by these systems. Under the delegated underwriting program, lenders may use their own AUS provided we have reviewed and approved their system. AUS have automated many of the underwriting steps that were previously performed by underwriters on a manual basis and use sophisticated mortgage scoring methodologies to evaluate borrower default risk. Although we review AUS before allowing their use under our delegated program, under which lenders have the responsibility to determine whether the loans comply with our approved underwriting guidelines, a potential risk to us of using AUS is factors we might otherwise evaluate in making an underwriting decision are not considered if not required by AUS. Loans insured under our delegated underwriting program accounted for approximately 60% of our total risk in force as of December 31, 2005, compared to 59% as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The percentage of new risk written by delegated underwriters was 61% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 58% and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In pricing mortgage insurance policies, we generally target substantially similar returns on capital regardless of the loan to value ratio, product type and depth of coverage. We establish premium rates principally on the basis of long term claims experience in the industry, reflecting periods of lower and higher losses and various regional economic downturns. We believe over the long term each region of the U.S. will be subject to similar factors affecting risk of loss on insurance written, and, therefore, we generally use a nationally based premium rate policy, 29 Table of Contents rather than a regional, local or lender based policy. Our premium rates vary with the coverage percentage and the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan, which takes into account the loan to value ratio, the type of mortgage and the term of the mortgage. Our premium rates also reflect our expectations, based upon our analysis of historical data, of the persistency of the policies in our book of business. Our premium rates also take into account competitive alternatives available to consumers, including rates offered by other mortgage insurers. For a certain number of our products, our premium rates do vary based on the location of the borrowers credit score within a range of credit scores. In accordance with industry practice, we use the FICO score as one indicator of a borrowers credit quality. Fair Isaac and Company, or FICO, developed the FICO credit scoring model to calculate a FICO score based upon a borrowers credit history. The higher the credit score, the lower the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. FICO credit scores range up to 850, with a score of 620 or more generally viewed as a prime loan and a score below 620 generally viewed as a sub prime loan. A minus loans generally are loans where the borrowers have FICO credit scores between 575 and 660, and where the borrower has a blemished credit history. Some of our products require a minimum FICO score and or have rates based on FICO scores. As of December 31, 2005, on a risk in force basis, approximately 92% of our flow insurance loans had FICO credit scores of at least 620, approximately 6% had FICO credit scores between 575 and 619, and approximately 2% had FICO scores of 574 or less. As of December 31, 2005, on a risk in force basis, approximately 96% of our bulk insurance loans had FICO credit scores of at least 620, approximately 2% had FICO credit scores between 575 and 619, and approximately 2% had FICO scores of 574 or less. The majority of loans we currently insure in bulk transactions meet the conforming loan limit and have FICO credit scores of at least 620. After 2001, we significantly reduced writing insurance of loans in bulk transactions that included non conforming and lesser quality loans, such as A minus loans and sub prime loans, because we believe market pricing was inadequate to compensate us for the risk. We also provide mortgage insurance for Alt A loans, which are originated under programs in which there is a reduced level of verification or disclosure of the borrowers income or assets. For an Alt A loan, the borrowers credit strength and history and the appraised value of the property are carefully reviewed. We also impose limitations on Alt A loans, including limitations with respect to the purpose of the loan and the type of property. Alt A loans represented 5.1%, 2.8% and 1.9% of our risk in force as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We also provide insurance for loans with an initial Interest Only payment option. The Interest Only payment option allows the borrower flexibility to pay interest only, or to pay interest and as much principal as desired, during an initial period of time. We impose credit score, occupancy type and loan to value restrictions on these loans. Interest Only loans represented 3.3% of our U.S. risk in force as of December 31, 2005 and 1.0% or less as of December 31, 2004 and prior. 30 Table of Contents Loan portfolio The following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our U.S. primary mortgage insurance loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Primary risk in force lender concentration (by original applicant) $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Top 10 lenders 8,608 9,755 12,047 Top 20 lenders 10,983 11,938 14,392 Loan to value ratio 95.01% and above $ 4,105 $ 3,601 $ 3,431 90.01% to 95.00% 8,362 9,450 10,759 80.01% to 90.00% 8,859 9,555 10,868 80.00% and below 412 363 747 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Loan grade Prime $ 19,482 $ 20,704 $ 23,408 A minus and sub prime 2,256 2,265 2,397 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Loan type(1) Fixed rate mortgage $ 20,325 $ 21,492 $ 24,354 Adjustable rate mortgage 1,413 1,477 1,451 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Type of documentation Alt A $ 1,104 $ 633 $ 503 Standard 20,634 22,336 25,302 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 Mortgage term 15 years and under $ 737 $ 1,163 $ 1,489 More than 15 years 21,001 21,806 24,316 Total $ 21,738 $ 22,969 $ 25,805 (1) For loan type in this table, any loan with an interest rate that is fixed for an initial term of five years or more is categorized as a fixed rate mortgage. Loans in default and claims Our default management process begins with notification by the loan servicer of a default on an insured loan. Default is defined in our master policies as the borrowers failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage. Generally, the master policies require an insured to notify us of a default no later than ten days after the borrower has been in default by three monthly payments. In most cases, however, defaults are reported earlier. We generally consider a loan to be in default and establish reserves if the borrower has failed to make a required mortgage payment for two consecutive months. Borrowers default for a variety of reasons, including a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit and interest rate levels. Borrowers may cure defaults by making all of the delinquent loan payments or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In most cases, defaults that are not cured result in a claim under our policy. 31 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the number of loans insured, the number of loans in default and the default rate for our U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio: December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Primary Insurance Insured loans in force 744,970 830,688 950,157 Loans in default 27,391 28,467 32,207 Percentage of loans in default (default rate) 3.7 % 3.4 % 3.4 % Flow loans in force 643,954 719,533 839,891 Flow loans in default 26,163 26,737 29,787 Percentage of flow loans in default (default rate) 4.1 % 3.7 % 3.5 % Bulk loans in force 101,016 111,155 110,266 Bulk loans in default 1,228 1,730 2,420 Percentage of bulk loans in default (default rate) 1.2 % 1.6 % 2.2 % A minus and sub prime loans in force 67,514 69,817 75,584 A minus and sub prime loans in default 7,072 7,068 6,881 Percentage of A minus and sub prime loans in default (default rate) 10.5 % 10.1 % 9.1 % Pool Insurance Insured loans in force 19,524 25,303 37,702 Loans in default 597 777 855 Percentage of loans in default (default rate) 3.1 % 3.1 % 2.3 % Primary insurance default rates differ from region to region in the U.S. at any one time depending upon economic conditions and cyclical growth patterns. The two tables below set forth our primary default rates for the various regions of the U.S. and the ten largest states by our risk in force as of December 31, 2005. Default rates are shown by region based upon location of the underlying property, rather than the location of the lender. We believe that increases in the 2005 default rates for the South Central and Southeast regions reflect increased delinquencies associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, this did not have a material impact to our 2005 results of operations.

Based upon our experience, the majority of claims on primary mortgage insurance loans occur in the third through seventh years after loan origination, and relatively few claims are paid during the first two years after loan origination. Primary insurance written from the period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2002 represented 18% of our primary insurance in force as of December 31, 2005. This portion of our loan portfolio is in its expected peak claim period with respect to traditional primary loans. We believe our A minus and sub prime loans will have earlier incidences of default than our prime loans. A minus loans represented 4.8% and 4.4% of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and sub prime loans represented 5.6% and 5.5% of our primary risk in force as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table sets forth the dispersion of our primary insurance in force and risk in force as of December 31, 2005, by year of policy origination and average annual mortgage interest rate since we began operations in 1981: (Dollar amounts in millions) Average rate Primary insurance in force Percent of total Primary risk in force Percent of total Policy Year 1996 and Prior 8.18 % $ 3,086 3.08 % $ 739 3.40 % 1997 7.83 % 543 0.54 147 0.67 1998 7.12 % 1,496 1.49 383 1.76 1999 7.24 % 1,727 1.72 430 1.98 2000 8.15 % 1,046 1.04 258 1.19 2001 7.38 % 3,982 3.98 964 4.43 2002 6.54 % 9,713 9.69 2,314 10.65 2003 5.62 % 34,681 34.60 6,234 28.68 2004 5.80 % 19,411 19.37 4,286 19.72 2005 5.97 % 24,545 24.49 5,983 27.52 Total portfolio 6.19 % $ 100,230 100.00 % $ 21,738 100.00 % Primary mortgage insurance claims paid, including loss adjustment expenses, or LAE, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $145 million, compared to $146 million and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pool insurance claims paid were $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The frequency of defaults may not correlate directly with the number of claims received because the rate at which defaults are cured is influenced by borrowers financial resources and circumstances and regional economic differences. Whether an uncured default leads to a claim principally depends upon the borrowers 33 Table of Contents equity at the time of default and the borrowers or the insureds ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan. When we receive notice of a default, we use a proprietary model to determine whether a delinquent loan is a candidate for work out. When the model identifies such a candidate, our loan workout specialists prioritize cases for loss mitigation based upon the likelihood that the loan will result in a claim. Loss mitigation actions include loan modification, extension of credit to bring a loan current, foreclosure forbearance, pre foreclosure sale, and deed in lieu. These loss mitigation efforts often are an effective way to reduce our claim exposure and ultimate payouts. Our policies require the insured to file a claim with us, specifying the claim amount (unpaid principal, interest and expenses), no later than 60 days after it has acquired title to the underlying property, usually through foreclosure. The claim amount is subject to our review and possible adjustment. Depending upon the applicable state foreclosure law, an average of approximately 18 months elapse from the date of default to the filing of a claim on an uncured default. Our master policies exclude coverage where there is physical damage whether caused by fire, earthquake or other catastrophe, unless the property is restored to its condition at the time the insurance was placed, with reasonable wear and tear excepted. We have the right to rescind coverage and refuse to pay a claim if it is determined that the insured or its agents misrepresented material information in the insurance application. In addition, where loans are underwritten by lenders through our delegated underwriting program, we have the right to rescind coverage if the loan was not underwritten in compliance with our approved guidelines. Within 60 days after a claim and supporting documentation have been filed, we have the option: to pay the claim amount, multiplied by coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance; in the event the property is sold pursuant to an agreement made prior to payment of the claim, which we refer to as a pre arranged sale, to pay the lesser of 100% of the claim amount less the proceeds of sale of the property, or the claim amount multiplied by the coverage percentage; or to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure, and acquire title to the property. We bear the risk of any loss in connection with the acquisition and sale of the property. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we settled approximately 50% of the primary insurance claims processed for payment on the basis of a pre arranged sale. The ratio of the claim paid to the current risk in force for a loan is referred to as claim severity. The current aggregate risk in force is equal to the unpaid principal amount multiplied by the coverage percentage. The main determinants of claim severity are the age of the mortgage loan, the value of the underlying property, accrued interest on the loan, expenses advanced by the insured and foreclosure expenses. These amounts depend partly upon the time required to complete foreclosure, which varies depending upon state laws. Pre foreclosure sales, acquisitions and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall claim severity. Our average primary mortgage insurance claim severity was 95%, 94% and 93% for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Competition We compete primarily with U.S. and state government agencies, other private mortgage insurers, mortgage lenders and other investors, the GSEs and, potentially, the Federal Home Loan Banks. We also compete, indirectly, with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate credit risk. U.S. and state government agencies. We and other private mortgage insurers compete for flow business directly with U.S. federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies, principally the FHA and, to a lesser degree, the VA. In the aggregate, the FHA and VA had a 23.5% market share in 2005 and a 32.8% market share in 2004, according to information published by Inside Mortgage Finance. 34 Table of Contents Loans insured by the FHA cannot exceed maximum principal amounts that are determined by a percentage of the conforming loan limit. For 2006, the maximum FHA loan amount for homes with one dwelling unit in high cost areas is $362,790 and the maximum VA loan amount is $417,000. We and other private mortgage insurers are not limited as to maximum individual loan amounts we can insure. In addition to competition from the FHA and the VA, we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from state supported mortgage insurance funds in several states, including California, Illinois and New York. From time to time, other state legislatures and agencies consider expansions of the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages. Government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do. Although private companies establish pricing terms for their products to achieve targeted returns, these government entities may offer products on terms designed to accomplish social or political objectives or reflect other non economic goals. Private mortgage insurers. The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. The private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of seven mortgage insurers plus our company. Mortgage lenders and other investors. We and other mortgage insurers compete with transactions structured by mortgage lenders to avoid mortgage insurance on low down payment mortgage loans. These transactions include self insuring and simultaneous second loans, which separate a mortgage with a loan to value ratio of more than 80%, which generally would require mortgage insurance, into two loans, a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio of 80% and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan. Simultaneous second loans are also often known as 80 10 10 loans, because they often comprise a first mortgage with an 80% loan to value ratio, a second mortgage with a 10% loan to value ratio and the remaining 10% paid in cash by the buyer, rather than a single mortgage with a 90% loan to value ratio. However, simultaneous seconds also can be structured as 80 15 5 loans or 80 20 0 loans, as well as other configurations. Over the past several years, we believe the volume of simultaneous second loans as an alternative to loans requiring private mortgage insurance has increased substantially. We believe this recent increase reflects the following factors: the lower cost of simultaneous second loans compared to the cost of mortgage insurance, due to the current low interest rate environment and the emerging popularity of 15 and 30 year amortizing and adjustable rate simultaneous seconds; the fact that second mortgage interest is generally tax deductible, whereas mortgage insurance payments currently are not tax deductible (although from time to time there have been proposed legislative initiatives to permit deductions for mortgage insurance payments); negative consumer, broker and realtor perceptions of private mortgage insurance; and the desire by some investors to hold second mortgages. We are developing mortgage insurance products that seek to enhance the appeal of private mortgage insurance in view of the increasing volume of simultaneous second loans. For example, in 2004, we launched our HomeOpeners&reg; suite of products designed to compete more effectively with simultaneous second loans by offering consumers lower monthly payments, more deductible interest and involuntary job loss protection at no additional cost. Mortgage lenders also may compete with mortgage insurers as a result of legislation that has removed restrictions on affiliations between banks and insurers. The Graham Leach Bliley Act of 1999 permits the combination of banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company. This legislation may increase competition by increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. In addition, mortgage lenders that establish or affiliate with competing mortgage insurers may reduce their purchases of our products. 35 Table of Contents We also compete with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults, such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes, with lenders who forego mortgage insurance (self insure) on loans held in their portfolios, and with mortgage lenders who maintain captive mortgage insurance and reinsurance programs. The GSEs Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and The Federal Home Loans Banks. As the predominant purchasers of conventional mortgage loans in the U.S., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide a direct link between mortgage origination and capital markets. As discussed above under Primary mortgage insurance, most high loan to value mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are insured with private mortgage insurance issued by an insurer deemed qualified by the GSEs. Our mortgage insurance company is a qualified insurer with both GSEs. Private mortgage insurers may be subject to competition from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the extent the GSEs are compensated for assuming default risk that would otherwise be insured by the private mortgage insurance industry. The GSEs are currently subject to oversight by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD. In November 2004, HUD announced new GSE mortgage purchase requirements, known as affordable housing goals. Under these goals, which became effective January 1, 2005, the minimum percent of all loans purchased by the GSEs that must support low and moderate income home buyers increases annually from 50% in 2004 to 56% in 2008, and the minimum percent of such loans that must be on properties in underserved areas increases annually from 36% in 2004 to 39% in 2008. The GSEs goals to expand purchases of affordable housing loans may increase the size of the mortgage insurance market. The GSEs also have expanded programs to include commitments to purchase certain volumes of loans with loan to value ratios greater than 95%. Private mortgage insurers must satisfy requirements set by the GSEs to be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs, and the GSEs have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers. They also have the authority to change the pricing arrangements for purchasing retained participation mortgages as compared to insured mortgages, increase or reduce required mortgage insurance coverage percentages, and alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase. In addition to the GSEs, the Federal Home Loan Banks, or FHLBs, purchase single family conforming mortgage loans. Although not required to do so, the FHLBs currently use mortgage insurance on substantially all mortgage loans with a loan to value ratio above 80%. International mortgage insurance We have significant mortgage insurance operations in Australia and Canada, two of the largest markets for mortgage insurance products outside the U.S., as well as smaller operations in New Zealand and the developing markets in Europe, Mexico and Japan. The net premiums written in our international mortgage insurance business have increased by a compound annual growth rate of 32% for the three years ended December 31, 2005. Insurance in force for our international mortgage insurance business contributed 71% of our total insurance in force as of December 31, 2005 compared to 64% as of December 31, 2004 and 53% as of December 31, 2003. In addition, earnings from our international mortgage insurance business represented 53%, 47% and 39% of our mortgage insurance net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 37% from 2003 to 2005. The mortgage loan markets in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand are well developed. Although mortgage insurance plays an important role in each of these markets, the markets vary significantly and are influenced in large part by the different cultural, economic and regulatory conditions in each market. We believe the following factors have contributed to the growth of robust mortgage insurance demand in these countries: a desire by lenders to offer low down payment mortgage loans to facilitate the expansion of their business; 36 Table of Contents the recognition of the higher default risk inherent in low down payment lending and the need for specialized underwriting expertise to conduct this business prudently; government housing policies that support increased homeownership; government policies that support the use of securitization and secondary market mortgage sales, in which third party credit enhancement is often used, as a source of funding and liquidity for mortgage lending; and bank regulatory capital policies that provide incentives to lenders to transfer some or all of the increased credit risk on low down payment mortgages to third parties, such as mortgage insurers. We believe a number of these factors are becoming evident in certain markets throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia and provide opportunities for us to expand our mortgage insurance business in those markets. Based upon our experience in the mature markets, we believe a favorable regulatory framework is important to the development of an environment in which lenders routinely extend high loan to value loans and use products such as mortgage insurance to protect against default risk or obtain capital relief. As a result, we have advocated governmental and policymaking agencies throughout our markets adopt legislative and regulatory policies supporting increased homeownership and capital relief for lenders and mortgage investors that insure their loan portfolios with private mortgage insurance. Although the products we offer in each of our international markets differ, they represent substantially similar risk propositions and involve similar business practices. We have developed significant expertise in mature markets, and we leverage this experience in developing markets as we continue to encourage regulatory authorities to implement incentives for private mortgage insurance as an effective risk management strategy. We believe the revisions to a set of regulatory rules and procedures governing global bank capital standards that were introduced by the Basel Committee of the Bank for International Settlements, known as Basel II, also may encourage further growth of international mortgage insurance. Basel II has been designed to reward banks that have developed effective risk management systems by allowing them to hold less capital than banks with less effective systems. For example, Basel II may reward a lender that transfers some risk of mortgage default to a third party insurer by reducing the amount of capital that the lender must hold to back a mortgage. Basel II was finalized and issued in June 2004; however, its adoption by individual countries is ongoing. Therefore, we cannot predict the benefits that ultimately will be provided to lenders, or how any such benefits may affect the opportunities for the growth of mortgage insurance. Under proposed rules released by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) during 2005 in connection with the Basel II framework, certain approved deposit taking institutions (ADIs) in Australia would be required to hold less capital on high loan to value mortgage loans and would also receive a capital incentive for using mortgage insurance, but at a reduced level when compared to current regulations in Australia. APRA has also proposed that ADIs would need to acquire mortgage insurance coverage levels lower than existing requirements in order to obtain these reduced capital incentives. We continue to work with APRA on this proposed rulemaking, which is expected to become effective January 1, 2008. If the final rules retain these provisions, lenders in Australia may be able to reduce their use of mortgage insurance for high loan to value ratio mortgages, which may have an adverse affect on our Australian business. Certain markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia have strong demand for housing, but are underserved by the existing housing finance systems. As a result, we believe that mortgage insurance could enhance the overall scale, effectiveness and efficiency of these mortgage markets. We expect lenders in these countries will seek to expand their consumer mortgage loan portfolios, while maintaining strong risk and capital management routines. With the expected implementation of the new Basel II standards, we believe we will be well positioned to assist lenders in these markets in meeting those goals and in complying with the anticipated complexity of the risk based capital and operating standards. 37 Table of Contents Canada We entered the Canadian mortgage insurance market in 1995 with our acquisition of certain assets and employees from the Mortgage Insurance Corporation of Canada, and we now operate in every province and territory. We are currently the only private mortgage insurer in the Canadian market, although other companies have recently applied for a license to sell mortgage insurance in Canada. Products We offer two products in Canada: primary flow insurance and portfolio credit enhancement insurance. Our principal product is primary flow insurance, which is similar to the primary flow insurance we offer in the U.S. Regulations in Canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks, trust companies and insurers, where the loan to value ratio exceeds 75%. Mortgage insurance in Canada is typically single premium and provides 100% coverage, in contrast to the U.S., where monthly premiums and lower coverage levels are typical. Under the single premium plan, lenders usually include the single premium as a part of the aggregate loan amount and pay a single premium to us as the mortgage insurer. We, in turn, record the proceeds to unearned premium reserves, invest those proceeds and recognize the premiums over time in accordance with the expected expiration of risk. We also provide portfolio credit enhancement insurance to lenders that have originated loans with loan to value ratios of less than 75%. These policies provide lenders with immediate capital relief from applicable bank regulatory capital requirements and facilitate the securitization of mortgages in the Canadian market. In both primary flow insurance and portfolio policies, our mortgage insurance in Canada provides insurance coverage for the entire unpaid loan balance, including interest, selling costs and expenses, following the sale of the underlying property. The leading mortgage product in the Canadian market is a mortgage with the interest rate fixed for the first five years of the loan. After the fifth year, the loan becomes due and payable and the borrower must negotiate its renewal, at which time the borrower may choose to have the interest rate float or have it fixed for an additional period. Lenders typically charge a mortgage pre payment penalty that serves as a disincentive for borrowers to refinance their mortgages. Changes in interest rates, adverse economic conditions and high levels of borrowing affect the frequency of defaults and claims with respect to these loans, which may adversely affect our loss experience. Regulations in Canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks, trust, companies and insurers with loan to value ratios greater than 75%. In February 2005, as part of a periodic review of the federal financial services regulatory framework, the Canadian Department of Finance issued a consultation document seeking comment on a wide variety of potential initiatives relating to the regulation of financial services, including whether to remove the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance on all loans with loan to value ratios greater than 75%. The removal of the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance, in whole or in part, may result in a reduction in the amount of business we write in future years in Canada. See Regulation Mortgage Insurance International Regulation Canada. Government guarantee We have an agreement with the Canadian government under which it guarantees the benefits payable under a mortgage insurance policy, less 10% of the original principal amount of an insured loan, in the event that we fail to make claim payments with respect to that loan because of insolvency. We pay the Canadian government a risk premium for this guarantee and make other payments to a reserve fund in respect of the governments obligation. Because banks are not required to maintain regulatory capital on an asset backed by a sovereign guarantee, our 90% sovereign guarantee permits lenders purchasing our mortgage insurance to reduce their regulatory capital charges for credit risks on mortgages by 90%. 38 Table of Contents Customers The nine largest mortgage originators in Canada, consisting of banks, trust companies, and credit unions, collectively provide more than 80% of the financing for Canadas residential mortgage financing. The nine largest originators in each of the past three years provided us with 83%, 87% and 85% of our new insurance written for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other market participants include regional banks, trust companies, and credit unions. Competitors Currently, the only other mortgage insurance competitor in Canada is the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, or CMHC, which is a Crown corporation owned by the Canadian government. Because CMHC is a government owned entity, its mortgage insurance provides lenders with 100% capital relief from bank regulatory requirements. We compete with CMHC primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service, quick decision making on insurance applications, strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development. In April 2005, the CMHC announced a 15% rate reduction for loans with a loan to value ratio exceeding 90%, which we have matched. Rate reductions or other actions taken by the CMHC to reduce rates or compete with us in other ways may cause our revenue in our Canadian mortgage insurance business to decline. In addition, as in other markets, we compete in Canada with alternative products and financial structures, such as credit default swaps, which are designed to transfer credit default risk on mortgage loans. Australia and New Zealand We entered the Australian mortgage insurance market in 1997 with our acquisition of the operating assets of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, or HLIC, from the Australian government. We entered the New Zealand mortgage insurance market in 1999 as an expansion of our Australian operations. Products In Australia and New Zealand, we offer primary flow insurance, known as lenders mortgage insurance, or LMI, and portfolio credit enhancement policies. Our principal product is LMI, which is similar to the primary flow insurance we offer in Canada, with single premiums and 100% coverage. Lenders usually collect the single premium from prospective borrowers at the time the loan proceeds are advanced and remit the amount to us as the mortgage insurer. We in turn record the proceeds to unearned premium reserves, invest those proceeds and recognize the premiums over time in accordance with the expected expiration of risk. We provide LMI on a flow basis to two types of customers: banks, building societies and credit unions; and non bank mortgage originators, called mortgage managers. Banks, building societies and credit unions generally acquire LMI only for residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios above 80%. Under APRA requirements, effective January 1, 2006, reduced capital requirements apply to high loan to value residential mortgages only if they have been insured by a mortgage insurance company that is regulated by APRA or is subject to comparable regulation in its home jurisdiction and is otherwise acceptable to APRA. After October 1, 2004, non standard loans with a loan to value ratio above 60% are entitled to a reduced capital requirement only if they meet strict requirements as established by APRA or are insured by a qualified LMI. APRAs regulations currently require APRA regulated lenders to determine the criteria for determining if a loan is a non standard type loan. Our insurance subsidiary that serves the Australian and New Zealand markets has financial strength ratings of AA (Very Strong) from S&P and Fitch and a rating of Aa2 (Excellent) from Moodys. The AA rating is the third highest of S&Ps 20 ratings categories and the third highest of Fitchs 24 ratings categories. The Aa2 rating is the third highest of Moodys 21 ratings categories. Mortgage managers fund their operations primarily through the issuance of mortgage backed securities. Because they are not regulated by APRA, they do not have the same capital incentives as banks for acquiring 39 Table of Contents LMI. However, they use LMI as the principal form of credit enhancement for these securities and generally purchase insurance for every loan they originate, without regard to the loan to value ratio. We also provide portfolio credit enhancement policies to APRA regulated lenders that have originated loans for securitization in the Australian market. Portfolio mortgage insurance serves as an important source of credit enhancement for the Australian securitization market, and our portfolio credit enhancement coverage generally is purchased for low loan to value, seasoned loans written by APRA regulated institutions. To date, a market for these portfolio credit enhancement policies has not developed in New Zealand to the same extent as in Australia. In both primary LMI and portfolio credit enhancement policies, our mortgage insurance provides insurance coverage for the entire unpaid loan balance, including selling costs and expenses, following the sale of the security property. Most of the loans we insure in Australia and New Zealand are variable rate mortgages with loan terms of between 20 and 30 years. In connection with our acquisition of the operating assets of HLIC in 1997, we agreed to service a mortgage insurance portfolio that was retained by the Australian government. We receive a small amount of management fees for handling claims and providing loss mitigation and related services, but we did not acquire HLICs originated insurance policies and do not bear any risk on those policies. Customers The ten largest mortgage originators in Australia, consisting of banks and mortgage managers, collectively provide more than 80% of Australias and New Zealands residential mortgage financing. The ten largest originators in each of the past three years provided us with 67% of our new insurance written for the year ended December 31, 2005, and 78% for 2004 and 2003. Other market participants in Australian and New Zealand mortgage lending include regional banks, building societies and credit unions. Competitors The Australian and New Zealand flow mortgage insurance markets currently are served by one other independent LMI company, as well as various lender affiliated captive mortgage insurance companies. We compete primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service, quick decision making on insurance applications, strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development. As in Canada, our products also compete in Australia and New Zealand with alternative products and financial structures that are designed to transfer credit default risk on mortgage loans. We believe other U.S. mortgage insurance providers are considering opportunities in Australia. APRAs license conditions require Australian mortgage insurance companies, including ours, to be mono line insurers, which are insurance companies that offer just one type of insurance product. Europe We began our European operations in the U.K., which is Europes largest market for mortgage loan originations. We expanded into six additional countries and we continue to explore opportunities in other European countries. Mortgage insurance originating in the U.K. accounted for approximately 42% of our European mortgage insurance in force as of December 31, 2005 as compared to 54% as of December 31, 2004. This large concentration in the U.K. is attributable primarily to the fact that we have been operating in that country considerably longer than in any other European country. Our growth in other European countries has helped to diversify our risk. Products Our European business currently consists principally of primary flow insurance on adjustable rate mortgages. As is the case in our other non U.S. markets, most primary flow insurance policies written in Europe 40 Table of Contents are structured with single premium payments. Our primary flow insurance generally provides first loss coverage in the event of default on a portion (typically 10% 20%) of the balance of an individual mortgage loan. We believe that, over time, there is an opportunity to provide additional products with higher coverage percentages to reduce the risks to lenders of low down payment lending to levels similar to those in more mature mortgage insurance markets. We also recently began offering portfolio credit enhancement policies to lenders that have originated loans for securitization in select European markets. Customers As a result of our strategy to expand organically into new markets in Europe with attractive growth potential, we have diversified our risk among seven countries, thereby reducing our historical concentration in the U.K. Our portfolio of international mortgage insurance in force in Europe is concentrated in the countries where we have been active for the longest period of time and with customers with whom we have been doing business for the longest period of time. We expect this concentration to diminish over time. Our customers are primarily banks and mortgage investors, and our largest customer in Europe represented 26% of our new insurance written for the year ended December 31, 2005. Competitors Our European business faces competition from both traditional mortgage insurance companies as well as providers of alternative credit enhancement products. Our competitors are both public and private entities. Public mortgage guarantee facilities exist in a number of countries, which may compete with our products. We also face competition from some of our U.S. private mortgage competitors as well as multi line insurers primarily in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. We also face competition from alternative credit enhancement products, such as personal guarantees on high loan to value loans, second mortgages and bank guarantees, and captive insurance companies organized by lenders. Lenders also have sought other forms of risk transfer, such as the use of capital market solutions through credit derivatives. In addition, some European lenders have chosen to price for and retain the additional credit risk, effectively self insuring their low down payment loans. We believe that our global expertise, coverage flexibility, and strong ratings provide a very valuable offering compared with competitors and alternative products. Loan portfolio The following table sets forth selected financial information regarding the effective risk in force of our international mortgage insurance loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: December 31, (Dollar amounts in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Loan to value ratio 95.01% and above $ 1,448 $ 515 $ 132 90.01% to 95.00% 19,337 14,707 11,549 80.01% to 90.00% 28,679 23,841 15,762 80.00% and below 29,539 22,944 15,926 Total $ 79,003 $ 62,007 $ 43,369 Loan type(1) Fixed rate mortgage $ 59 $ $ Adjustable rate mortgage 78,944 62,007 43,369 Total $ 79,003 $ 62,007 $ 43,369 Mortgage term 15 years and under $ 32,041 $ 26,138 $ 17,486 More than 15 years 46,962 35,869 25,883 Total $ 79,003 $ 62,007 $ 43,369 (1) For loan type in this table, any loan with an interest rate that is fixed for an initial term of five years or less is categorized as an adjustable rate mortgage. 41 Table of Contents Our businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Canada currently provide 100% coverage on the majority of the loans we insure in those markets. The table above presents effective risk in force, which recognizes the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property. Effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor that represents our highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of our businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. As of December 31, 2005, this factor was 35%. Loans in default and claims The claim process in our international mortgage insurance business is similar to the process we follow in our U.S. mortgage insurance business. See Mortgage Insurance U.S. mortgage insurance Loans in default and claims. The following table sets forth the number of loans insured, the number of loans in default and the default rate for our international mortgage insurance portfolio: December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Primary insurance Insured loans in force 1,910,964 1,591,485 1,282,731 Loans in default 7,091 5,304 4,926 Percentage of loans in default (default rate) 0.4 % 0.3 % 0.4 % Flow loans in force 1,627,587 1,346,035 1,044,131 Flow loans in default 6,866 5,084 4,679 Percentage of flow loans in default (default rate) 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.5 % Portfolio credit enhancement loans in force 283,377 245,450 238,600 Portfolio credit enhancement loans in default 225 220 247 Percentage of portfolio credit enhancement loans in default (default rate) 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % Corporate and Other Our Corporate and Other segment consists of net realized investment gains (losses), and unallocated corporate income and expenses (including amounts accrued in settlement of class action lawsuits), interest, and other financing expenses that are incurred at our holding company level. This segment also includes the results of our subsidiaries Viking Insurance Company LTD. (Viking), GE Seguros (Seguros) and other small, non core businesses that are managed outside our operating segments. Beginning in 2006, Seguros will be managed within our Protection segment as part of the payment protection business. Viking is a Bermuda based reinsurer primarily of leased equipment insurance and consumer credit insurance underwritten by American Bankers Insurance Company, or ABIC. GE Commercial Finance, formerly known as Vendor Financial Services, purchased property and casualty insurance from ABIC on behalf of certain of its lessees to cover leased equipment. ABIC then reinsured those policies with Viking. GE Consumer Finance, formerly Card Services, develops and markets credit insurance through credit card issuers, retailers and banks. These credit insurance policies also are underwritten by ABIC and then reinsured with Viking. GE Commercial Finance ceased purchasing new insurance coverage on behalf of lessees through ABIC, as of March 1, 2004, and GE Consumer Finance intends to phase out marketing credit insurance over the next several years. GE Capital has agreed to take all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the relevant existing insurance and reinsurance relationships, but we expect Vikings reinsurance programs with GE Consumer Finance and GE Commercial Finance to decline steadily over the next several years and, ultimately, be discontinued. With respect to GE Consumer Finances credit insurance, GE Capital may decide to encourage a switch of existing coverages to another program. In that event, GE Capital has agreed to pay Viking an amount equal to the net underwriting income Viking is projected to receive as reinsurer from the date of discontinuation of any credit insurance program through December 31, 2008. 42 Table of Contents Viking also has an in force block of reinsurance of U.S. and Canadian consumer auto warranties and property and casualty gap insurance that protects consumers from the risk of loss on any difference between the value of an automobile and any loans secured by it. We do not intend to enter into any new warranty of gap insurance reinsurance treaties, and the existing treaties are in run off, with the remaining program expiring gradually through 2008. Seguros, is a small Mexican domiciled multi line insurer. We acquired this business in 1995 and currently hold 99.6% of its outstanding shares. Seguros is licensed to sell property and casualty, life and health insurance in Mexico. Seguros currently writes primarily motor vehicle coverage for personal and commercial domestic vehicles and personal coverage for tourist vehicles. It also writes a small amount of homeowners, commercial property, transport and life insurance. Seguros distributes its products through independent agents in Mexico and, for the tourist auto business, it also distributes its products through agents located in key U.S. border locations. Seguros maintains agency relationships through its branch offices in major Mexican cities. Viking and Seguros had aggregate net earnings of $28 million, $44 million, and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included herein. Cautionary note regarding forward looking statements This Annual Report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements may be identified by words such as expects, intends, anticipates, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, will, or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance. Forward looking statements are based on managements current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially due to global political, economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, including the items identified above under Item 1A Risk Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Overview Our business We are a leading insurance company in the U.S., with an expanding international presence. We have three operating segments: Protection, Retirement Income and Investments, and Mortgage Insurance. Protection. We offer U.S. customers life insurance, long term care insurance and, primarily for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, group life and health insurance. In Europe, we offer payment protection insurance, which helps consumers meet their payment obligations in the event of illness, involuntary unemployment, disability or death. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Protection segment had segment net earnings of $568 million. Retirement Income and Investments. We offer U.S. customers fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed immediate annuities, variable life insurance, asset management and specialized products, including guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and structured settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Retirement Income and Investments segment had segment net earnings of $247 million. Mortgage Insurance. In the U.S., Canada, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, Mexico and Japan, we offer mortgage insurance products that facilitate homeownership by enabling borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages. For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Mortgage Insurance segment had segment net earnings of $507 million. 105 Table of Contents We also have a Corporate and Other segment, which consists primarily of unallocated corporate income and expenses (including amounts accrued in settlement of class action lawsuits), the results of small, non core businesses that are managed outside our operating segments, most of our interest and other financing expenses and net realized investment gains (losses). For the year ended December 31, 2005, our Corporate and Other segment had segment net losses of $101 million. Our corporate reorganization We were incorporated in Delaware on October 23, 2003 in preparation for our corporate reorganization and the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GEFAHI. GEFAHI is an indirect subsidiary of GE and prior to the completion of the IPO, was a holding company for a group of companies that provide life insurance, long term care insurance, group life and health insurance, annuities and other investment products and U.S. mortgage insurance. We also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the Genworth management team. These businesses include international mortgage insurance, payment protection insurance based in Europe, a Bermuda reinsurer and mortgage contract underwriting. In consideration for the assets that we acquired and the liabilities that we assumed in connection with our corporate reorganization, we issued to GEFAHI 489.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock, $600 million of our Equity Units, $100 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, a $2.4 billion short term note and a $550 million contingent non interest bearing note. We refinanced the $2.4 billion note with $1.9 billion of senior notes and $500 million of commercial paper shortly after the IPO, and we repaid the contingent note in December 2004. In connection with our corporate reorganization and the IPO, we entered into a number of arrangements with GE governing our separation from GE and a variety of transition and other matters, including our relationship with GE while GE remained a significant shareholder in our company. These arrangements include several significant reinsurance transactions with UFLIC, an indirect subsidiary of GE. As part of these transactions, effective as of January 1, 2004, we ceded to UFLIC all of our structured settlement contracts and substantially all of our variable annuity contracts, and a block of long term care insurance policies that we reinsured in 2000 from The Travelers Insurance Company. In the aggregate, these blocks of business did not meet our target return thresholds, and although we remain liable under these contracts and policies as the ceding insurer, the reinsurance transactions have the effect of transferring the financial results of the reinsured blocks to UFLIC. We continue to service the blocks of business that we reinsured, which preserves our operating scale and enables us to service and grow our new sales of these products. In addition, as part of the reinsurance transactions, UFLIC ceded to us substantially all of its in force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance. Our financial information The financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K has been derived from our financial statements, which have been prepared as if Genworth had been in existence throughout all periods. Our financial statements include, for all periods, the insurance businesses that we acquired from GE subsidiaries in connection with our corporate reorganization on May 24, 2004. Until the corporate reorganization, our financial statements also included the businesses that were owned by GEFAHI but not transferred to us in connection with our corporate reorganization. In addition to our three operating segments and our Corporate and Other segment, our financial statements also include the results of (1) the Partnership Marketing Group business, which offers life and health insurance, auto club memberships and other financial products and services directly to consumers through affinity marketing arrangements with a variety of organizations, (2) an institutional asset management business owned by GEFAHI, and (3) several other small businesses owned by GEFAHI that are not part of our core ongoing business. The Partnership Marketing Group historically included UFLIC, a subsidiary that offered life and health insurance products through affinity marketing arrangements. In connection with the IPO, GEFAHI transferred UFLIC to General Electric Capital Services, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of GE. We did not acquire the Partnership Marketing Group business, the institutional asset management business or these other small 106 Table of Contents businesses from GEFAHI, and their results are presented as a separate operating segment under the caption Affinity. Our financial statements also include our Japanese life insurance and domestic auto and homeowners insurance businesses, which we sold on August 29, 2003, and which are presented in our financial statements as discontinued operations. Revenues and expenses Our revenues consist primarily of the following: Protection. The revenues in our Protection segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on individual life, individual long term care, group life and health and payment protection insurance policies; net investment income on the separate investment portfolio held by our payment protection insurance business or allocated to this segments other lines of business; and policy fees and other income, including fees for mortality and surrender charges primarily from universal life insurance policies, and other administrative charges. Retirement Income and Investments. The revenues in our Retirement Income and Investments segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on income annuities and structured settlements with life contingencies; net investment income allocated to this segment; and policy fees and other income, including surrender charges, mortality and expense charges, investment management fees and commissions. Mortgage Insurance. The revenues in our Mortgage Insurance segment consist primarily of: net premiums earned on mortgage insurance policies; net investment income on the segments separate investment portfolio; and policy fees and other income, including fees from contract underwriting services. Corporate and Other. The revenues in our Corporate and Other segment consist primarily of: net premiums, policy fees and other income from the insurance businesses in this segment; unallocated net investment income; and net realized investment gains (losses). We allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Protection (except payment protection insurance) and Retirement Income and Investments segments using an approach based principally upon the investment portfolio established to support each of those segments products and targeted capital levels. We do not allocate net investment income from our Corporate and Other segment to our Mortgage Insurance segment or to our payment protection insurance business within the Protection segment, because they have their own separate investment portfolios, and the net investment income from those portfolios is reflected in the Mortgage Insurance and Protection segment results. In our financial statements, we allocated net investment income to our Affinity segment in the same manner that we allocated these items to our Protection and Retirement Income and Investments segments. All net realized investment gains (losses) are reflected in the Corporate and Other segment and are not reflected in the results of any of our other segments. Our expenses consist primarily of the following: benefits provided to policyholders and contractholders and changes in reserves; interest credited on general account balances; operating expenses, including commissions, marketing expenses, policy and contract servicing costs, overhead and other general expenses that are not capitalized (shown net of deferrals); 107 Table of Contents amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other intangible assets; interest and other financing expenses; and income taxes. We allocate corporate expenses to each of our operating segments based on the amount of capital allocated to that segment. Business trends and conditions In recent years, our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, influenced by a number of industry wide and product specific trends and conditions. For discussion of the market and economic environment, see Item 1 Business Market Environment and Opportunities. General conditions and trends affecting our businesses Interest rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in market interest rates and the related yield curve may have a significant effect on our sales of insurance and investment products and our margins on these products. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. In our Retirement Income and Investments and Protection segments, low market interest rates may reduce the spreads between the amounts we credit to policyholders and contractholders and the yield we earn on the investments that support these obligations. In response to the unusually low interest rates that have prevailed during the last several years, we have reduced the guaranteed minimum crediting rates on newly issued fixed annuity contracts and have reduced crediting rates on in force contracts where permitted to do so. These actions have helped mitigate the adverse impact of low interest rates on our spreads and profitability on these products. In addition, the recent flattening of the yield curve reduces the attractiveness of certain fixed annuity products relative to other short term investment alternatives. A gradual increase in longer term interest rates generally will have a favorable effect on the profitability of these products. However, rapidly rising interest rates also could result in reduced persistency in our spread based retail products as contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. In our Protection segment, the pricing and expected future profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products are based in part on expected investment returns. Over time, term life and long term care insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as we receive them. Low interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our term life and long term care insurance products. The impact of interest rate fluctuations on our universal life insurance products is similar to its impact on spread based products in our Retirement Income and Investments segment. In our Mortgage Insurance segment, increasing interest rates in 2004 and 2005 contributed to a decrease in new mortgage originations in the U.S. since 2003. The level of new mortgage originations was $3,120 billion and $2,920 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. This compares to $3,945 billion of new mortgage originations for the year ended December 31, 2003. We believe the decrease in mortgage originations since 2003 was principally driven by two factors. First, increasing interest rates in 2004 and 2005 made refinancing of existing mortgages less attractive to consumers than in recent years. Second, with historically low interest rates in 2002 and 2003, many mortgages for which refinancing would otherwise have been economically attractive were already refinanced. Higher interest rates in 2004 and 2005 and the significant refinancing activity in 2002 and 2003 also resulted in reduced refinancing activity in 2004 and 2005, which had a positive impact on U.S. flow persistency. U.S. flow persistency rates increased from 46% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 65% for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. Continued interest rate increases may have a favorable impact on persistency and could have an adverse impact on new mortgage originations. If home price appreciation slows, policy cancellations may decline, which would positively affect our U.S. flow persistency rate. 108 Table of Contents Volatile equity markets. Equity market volatility may discourage purchases of separate account products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance, that have returns linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause some existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products. Equity market volatility also affects the value of the assets in our separate accounts, which, in turn, affects our earnings from fee based products. After several years of declines, equity markets increased in 2003 and 2004 and stabilized in 2005. We expect that increases or relative stability in equity markets, along with certain guaranteed product options we offer, could have a favorable impact on our sales of variable products and our earnings from those products. The potential impact of volatile equity markets on our results has been significantly reduced as a result of our reinsurance arrangements with UFLIC, pursuant to which we reinsured, effective as of January 1, 2004, substantially all of our in force blocks of variable annuities. We retain variable annuities sold after January 1, 2004 for our own account, subject to third party reinsurance transactions in the ordinary course of business, and therefore we bear the risk of any adverse impact of future equity market fluctuations on those annuities. In addition, fluctuations in the equity markets may affect revenues and returns from our private asset management products and services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management. Credit default risk. As a result of the economic downturn in 2000 through 2002 and some high profile corporate bankruptcies and scandals, the number of companies defaulting on their debt obligations increased dramatically in 2001 and 2002. These defaults and other declines in the value of some of our investments resulted in impairment charges. Credit defaults have decreased in recent years as the economy has improved. Charges associated with impairments of investments were $71 million, $26 million and $224 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A weakening in the economic recovery could lead to increased credit defaults. Investment portfolio. The yield on our investment portfolio is affected by the practice, prior to our IPO, of realizing investment gains through the sale of appreciated securities and other assets during a period of historically low interest rates. This strategy had been pursued to offset impairments and losses in our investment portfolio, fund consolidations and restructurings in our business and provide current income, which resulted in gross realized gains of $473 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our current investment strategy is to optimize investment income without relying on realized investment gains. As a result, our gross realized gains decreased to $90 million and $108 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Although the interest rate environment since our IPO in mid 2004 has been challenging, the yield on our investment portfolio has stabilized, with the potential for yield increases in a rising interest rate environment. Our overall investment yield declined from 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased to 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005. We seek to improve our investment yield by continuously evaluating our asset class mix, pursuing additional investment classes and accepting additional credit risk with higher returns when we believe that it is prudent to do so. Globalization. Historically, we have derived a majority of our revenues and profits from our operations in the U.S. However, in recent years, our international business has grown and has had an increasing impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, 20%, 19% and 18% of our revenues, respectively, and 32%, 29% and 26% of our net earnings from continuing operations, respectively, were generated by our international operations. These increases were largely due to growth in our international mortgage insurance business. Our payment protection insurance business also derives revenues in the countries where it offers its products. We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates as we translate the operating results of our foreign operations into our financial statements. As a result, period to period comparability of our results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $4 million, $31 million and $25 million, respectively, due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our four principal foreign currencies are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the euro. Ongoing operating cost reductions and efficiencies. We continually focus on reducing our cost base while maintaining strong service levels for our customers. We expect to accomplish this goal in each of our operating units through a wide range of cost management disciplines, including consolidating operations, using low cost 109 Table of Contents operating locations, reducing supplier costs, leveraging process improvement efforts, forming dedicated teams to identify opportunities for cost reductions and investing in new technology, particularly for web based, digital end to end processes. Developments affecting our product lines Life insurance. Results in our life insurance business are impacted by mortality, persistency, investment yields, and the effective use of capital. Additionally, sales of new products are dependent on competitive product features and pricing, distribution expansion and penetration, and consistent customer service. Regulation XXX requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees, which increases the capital required to write these products. For term life insurance, we have implemented capital management actions that improve our new business returns and have enabled us to decrease our premium rates. Our competitive pricing, as well as our new product offerings, distribution expansion and ongoing service initiatives, have led to higher term and universal life insurance sales. Our annualized first year premiums and deposits for life insurance products increased by 47% from $144 million for year ended December 31, 2004 to $211 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Recently, several competitors have executed similar capital management actions and lowered their term prices, which could have an adverse impact on our future sales. In addition, an October 2005 revision to actuarial guidelines for Regulation XXX, effective for universal life policies issued since July 1, 2005, may increase the reserves of certain companies on a statutory basis. Reserves for our universal life policies already meet the requirements of this guideline, so it will not have an impact on our capital requirements. Long term care insurance. Results of our long term care insurance business are influenced by morbidity, persistency, investment yields, new product sales and expenses. Industry wide first year annualized premiums of individual long term care insurance decreased approximately 5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, according to the most recently published data by LIMRA International. Our annualized first year premiums have increased by 5% from $162 million in 2004 to $170 million in 2005. Our sales stability in a challenging market reflects the breadth of our distribution and progress across multiple growth initiatives with an emphasis on broadening our product offerings. However, slower than anticipated sales growth, the continued low interest rate environment, and lower termination rates on our older issued policies, could result in lower net operating earnings. In response to these trends, we will continue to pursue multiple growth initiatives, continue investing in claims process improvements, execute investment strategies and, if appropriate, consider rate increases to improve loss ratios. In addition, in January 2006, we agreed to acquire Continental Life Insurance Company of Brentwood, Tennessee, a provider of Medicare supplement insurance, for approximately $145 million, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2006. This acquisition will enhance our presence in the Medicare supplement market by more than doubling our existing annualized premium for this product and giving us access to 4,200 independent agents. Payment protection insurance. Our payment protection insurance business continued to show strong growth from increased penetration of existing, and the addition of new, distribution relationships. In the aggregate, written premiums, gross of reinsurance and cancellations, in the payment protection insurance business increased by 22% from $1,501 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $1,829 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Annuities. Retirement Income and Investments segment results are affected by investment performance, net interest spreads, equity market fluctuations and new product sales. In addition, our competitive position within many of our distribution channels depends significantly upon product features, including current and minimum crediting rates on spread based products relative to our competitors, surrender charge periods in fixed annuities as well as guaranteed features we offer in variable products. We continually evaluate our competitive position based upon each of those features, and we make adjustments as appropriate to meet our target return thresholds. Our deposits in fixed annuities increased by 3% from $1,719 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $1,771 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. However, the attractiveness of certain fixed annuities has declined as a result of continued long term low interest rates and a flattening yield curve, resulting in short term 110 Table of Contents investment alternatives being more competitive. Further we saw a shift of demand from fixed annuities to products with equity index components, such as equity indexed annuities. While we did not have a product with an equity component in the market in 2005, we have launched our own design in the first quarter of 2006. These events, along with our pricing discipline of selling business that meets our profitability objectives, have adversely affected sales of our fixed annuities. We believe, however, that a gradual increase in market interest rates on the long duration end of the yield curve would have a favorable impact on consumer demand for these products. In recent quarters, we have experienced improved spreads in these products. Structured settlement contract sales declined 35% from $533 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decline is primarily a result of our continued pricing discipline in a low interest rate environment. Total new deposits in variable annuities, excluding our Income Distribution Series, decreased by 28% from $848 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $612 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decline is primarily due to a decrease in additional deposits on a block of reinsured business, as well as a market shift to variable annuity products with certain guaranteed benefit features that we chose not to offer because of their risk profile. We have continued to focus on our Income Distribution Series of variable annuity products and riders in response to customers who desire guaranteed minimum income streams with equity market upside at the end of the contribution and accumulation period. Our Income Distribution Series of variable annuity products and riders provides the contractholder with a guaranteed minimum income stream that they cannot outlive, along with an opportunity to participate in market appreciation, but reduces some of the risks to insurers that generally accompany traditional products with guaranteed minimum income benefits. We are targeting people who are focused on building a personal portable retirement plan or are moving from the accumulation to the distribution phase of their retirement planning. Sales of our Income Distribution Series increased by 86% from $258 million for year ended December 31, 2004 to $481 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Third party managed assets. We offer asset management products to affluent individual investors. Our products consist of separately managed accounts, managed mutual funds accounts and managed variable annuity services. We receive a management fee based upon the amount of assets under management. The results of our asset management business are a function of net flows of assets under management which are influenced by relative investment performance of our products and of the overall equity market environment. Third party managed assets grew by 30% from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2004 to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to the net sales over the period and the impact of the equity market appreciation. Mortgage insurance. The results of our Mortgage Insurance segment are affected by employment and other economic and housing markets trends, including mortgage origination volume, interest rate trends, home price appreciation and levels of mortgage delinquencies (including seasonal effects). In addition, our international mortgage insurance results are affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. In the U.S., the demand for flow private mortgage insurance declined during 2005, according to data published by Inside Mortgage Finance. We believe this was driven principally by increases in (1) the use of simultaneous second mortgages, or 80 10 10 loans, as an alternative to private mortgage insurance, (2) the origination of mortgages that did not meet the eligibility requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and (3) mortgages that were securitized in mortgage backed securities that did not use private mortgage insurance. We believe higher short term interest rates and a flattening yield curve have caused 80 10 10 penetration into the mortgage insurance market to stabilize. Our U.S. flow new insurance written increased by 3% from $24.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $25.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was attributable to increased customer penetration as a result of executing a more disciplined customer segmentation strategy. Ongoing low interest rates and home price appreciation in the U.S. have contributed to persistency rates remaining low. Our U.S. persistency rates remained flat at 65% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. The continued low interest rate environment has adversely affected our insurance in force levels. Continued low persistency rates could have an adverse impact on future earnings. 111 Table of Contents Our international mortgage insurance business has continued to expand with favorable operating results. International flow new insurance written increased by 31% from $49.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $64.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was driven primarily by a larger mortgage originations market in Australia and increased customer penetration in our established international markets, particularly in Australia and Europe, as well as favorable foreign exchange movements. International bulk new insurance written increased from $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $14.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was driven by our selective expansion into prime bulk offerings with key customers in Australia and Europe as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. We expect that the growth of our established international mortgage insurance business and our entry into new international markets will continue to contribute an increasing portion of this segments total revenues and profits. As a result of the significant U.S. refinancing activity since 2002 and the significant expansion of our international business in recent years, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 76% of our U.S. risk in force and 67% of our international risk in force have not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years, which are generally between the third and seventh year of the loan. We expect our loss experience on these loans will increase as policies continue to mature. Separation from GE and related financial arrangements GE historically has provided a variety of products and services to us, and we have provided various products and services to GE. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a transition services agreement and various other agreements with GE that, together with a number of agreements that were in effect before the IPO, govern the relationship between GE and us. Services received from GE Support services and corporate overhead. GE historically has provided a variety of support services for our businesses, including: customer service, transaction processing and a variety of functional support services provided by an outsourcing provider in India; employee benefit processing and payroll administration, including relocation, travel, credit card processing and related services; employee training programs, including access to GE training courses; insurance coverage under the GE insurance program; information systems, network and related services; leases for vehicles, equipment and facilities; and other financial advisory services such as tax consulting, capital markets services, research and development activities, and use of trademarks and licenses. We have reimbursed GE for the costs of providing these services to us. We paid GE a total of $34 million, $65 million, and $87 million for these services for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, GE historically has allocated to us a share of its corporate overhead expenses for certain services provided to us, which are not specifically billed to us, including public relations, investor relations, treasury, and internal audit services. Our total expense for this allocation was $14 million and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We have not reimbursed these amounts to GE, and have recorded them as a capital contribution in each year. Following the completion of the IPO, GE no longer allocates any of its corporate expenses to us. 112 Table of Contents GE continues to provide us with some of the corporate services described above on a transitional basis, and we are arranging to procure other services pursuant to arrangements with third parties or through our own employees. In the aggregate, we expect that our total costs for procuring corporate services that previously had been provided by GE will not materially exceed the amounts we historically have paid to GE for these services, including GEs allocation to us for its corporate overhead. However, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental advertising, marketing, investor relations and legal entity transition expenses to establish a new brand identity. We also incurred compensation expense with respect to the establishment of our new equity plans. In addition, we have obtained direct access to a variety of third party products and services, including technology licenses, as a result of GEs relationships with those third parties. We have negotiated and are continuing to negotiate our own arrangements with third party providers for these products and services, and we do not believe these arrangements will result in materially increased costs in the aggregate. Investment management services. We have received and will continue to receive investment management services from GE Asset Management Incorporated, or GEAM, a subsidiary of GE, pursuant to agreements that were, with limited exceptions, amended in connection with the IPO. We also entered into new agreements with GE Asset Management Limited, or GEAML, an affiliate of GEAM, for investment management services in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Pursuant to these agreements, the fees charged by GEAM and GEAML are based on a percentage of the value of the assets under management. This percentage is established annually by agreement between us and GEAM or GEAML and is intended to reflect the cost to GEAM or GEAML of providing its services and, for the agreements with GEAML, a premium of 5%. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our aggregate costs for investment management and related administration services provided by GEAM and GEAML were approximately $22 million, $33 million, and $61 million respectively. Reinsurance transactions. In addition to our arrangements with UFLIC, we have entered into reinsurance transactions with affiliates of GE, principally Employers Reassurance Corporation and ERC Life Reinsurance Corporation (formerly an affiliate of GE), which we refer to collectively as ERC, under which we have reinsured some of the risks of our insurance policies on terms comparable to those we could obtain from third parties. We have paid premiums to these affiliates of $37 million, $39 million, and $56 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, in 2002, one of our subsidiaries entered into a life reinsurance agreement with an affiliated company, GE Pensions Limited, to reinsure 95% of our liabilities under certain life insurance policies. We have paid premiums to this affiliate of $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This agreement was terminated as of December 31, 2003. Employee benefit plans. Historically, we have reimbursed GE for benefits it has provided to our employees under various employee benefit plans, including GEs retirement plan, retiree health and life insurance benefit plans, defined contribution savings plan and life and health insurance benefits through the GE benefit program. We incurred expenses associated with these plans of $95 million, $108 million, and $109 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. GE provided these benefits to our employees until September 27, 2005, at which time GE ceased to own more than 50% of our outstanding common stock.
