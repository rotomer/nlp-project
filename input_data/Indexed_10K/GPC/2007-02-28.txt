MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in Item 1.A Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F 1 of this report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period. Overview Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. We have increased sales in 56 of the last 57 years and increased profits in 44 of the last 46 years. In 2006, business was conducted throughout the United States, in Puerto Rico, in Canada and in Mexico from approximately 2,000 locations. We recorded consolidated net sales of $10.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 7% compared to $9.8 billion in 2005. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $475 million, up 9% from $437 million in 2005. The combination of ongoing healthy economic conditions, strong end markets and effective internal initiatives provided us the opportunity to achieve another record level of sales and earnings in 2006. All four business segments contributed to our progress for the year, with each showing gains in revenues and profits. Our progress in 2006 follows 8% increases in revenues in both 2004 and 2005, and represents the third consecutive year of double digit growth in earnings per share. During the three year period ended December 31, 2006, the Company implemented a variety of growth initiatives, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and cost savings initiatives. Each of our business segments participated in developing these initiatives, as discussed further below. The major categories on the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet were relatively consistent with the December 31, 2005 balance sheet categories, subject to certain exceptions explained below. Our cash balances decreased $53 million or 28% from December 31, 2005, due primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments in capital expenditures. Accounts receivable grew $41 million or 3%, which is less than our increase in revenues, and inventory was up less than 1%. Accounts payable decreased $63 million or 7% from the prior year, due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006, resulting in the decrease in days payables outstanding. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 was unchanged from December 31, 2005. Results of Operations Our results of operations are summarized for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as follows: (in thousands, except per share data) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net Sales $ 10,457,942 $ 9,783,050 $ 9,097,267 Gross Profit 3,275,495 3,064,086 2,829,723 Net Income 475,405 437,434 395,552 Diluted Earnings Per Share 2.76 2.50 2.25 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $10.5 billion, another record sales level for the Company and a 7% increase from 2005. Again in 2006, each of our four business segments showed progress in revenues and contributed to our overall sales growth. We attribute this improvement to the ongoing good health of the national economy, strong end markets and effective growth initiatives. For the year, prices were up approximately 2% in the Automotive segment, 3% in the Industrial and Office segments and 7% in the Electrical segment. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $9.8 billion, an 8% increase from 2004. Similar to 2006, all of the business segments contributed to our sales growth in 2005, as our internal initiatives, healthy economy and positive trends in the industries we serve enhanced the sales volume in each of our four groups. Prices were up approximately 2% in the Automotive segment, 3% in the Office and Electrical segments and 6% in the Industrial segment in 2005. Automotive Group Net sales for the Automotive Group (Automotive) increased by 3% to $5.2 billion in 2006. After achieving sales increases of 5% in both the first and second quarters, our sales growth slowed to 1% growth in the third quarter, followed by a 2% increase in the fourth quarter. Automotives sales initiatives, including the addition of 64 net new NAPA AUTO PARTS stores and the continued expansion of NAPA AutoCare programs, were somewhat impacted by the effect of higher gasoline prices on vehicle miles driven and aftermarket product demand. Both of these factors influenced our sales trends for the year. Additionally, our core NAPA sales increase of 5% was offset by the sales decrease at Johnson Industries, which was downsized in 2005. 13 Table of Contents Automotive sales were $5.0 billion in 2005, an increase of 6% over 2004. Among the quarters in 2005, sales increases over the same period of the prior year ranged from an increase of 4% in the first quarter to 8% in the third quarter, our strongest period for the year. The continued effectiveness of our growth initiatives in this group, as well as positive industry trends, helped produce these results. As in 2006, stronger growth in our core NAPA operations was offset by a decrease in sales at Johnson Industries, where we sold eight of twelve operations during 2005. Industrial Group Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (Industrial), were $3.1 billion in 2006, an increase of 11% compared to 2005, and our third consecutive year of 11% sales growth. In 2006, this group recorded steady progress throughout the year, with double digit growth in each quarter. Industrial expanded its distribution network during the year by opening 10 new locations and by adding another 31 locations via two acquisitions. U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization indices also showed continued strength for the manufacturing sector in 2006, and based on current indices, the outlook remains positive for this sector in 2007. Net sales in 2005 were $2.8 billion, an 11% increase compared to 2004. In 2005, this group had double digit growth in each quarter except in the fourth quarter when sales increased 9%. Over the three year period ended December 31, 2006, Industrial has benefited from a combination of price increases common in the industry as well as stronger sales volume. Office Group Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group (Office), were $1.8 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. Among our business groups, Office is our most steady performer from year to year, and in 2006, product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services helped to drive this groups progress. Although its rate of sales growth decreased during the year, we were encouraged by the Office groups performance in 2006. Sales increased by 13% in the first quarter, 6% in the second quarter, 5% in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth quarter. Net sales in 2005 were $1.7 billion, up 8% over 2004. This represents a solid increase for the Office group and reflects the success of its ongoing business expansion strategy. Among the quarters, revenues grew stronger over the year, with sales increasing 6% in the first quarter, 8% in the second and third quarters and 10% in the fourth quarter. Electrical Group Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (Electrical), increased by 20% to $408 million in 2006. The strong performance at Electrical reflects the continued manufacturing expansion in the U.S., as well as this groups commitment to ongoing sales initiatives. In 2006, Electrical completed phase one of a sales process restructuring program developed to improve customer contact and maximize customer growth. For the year, sales were up 13% in the first quarter, 24% in the second quarter, 23% in the third quarter and 17% in the fourth quarter. Net sales were up 2% to $342 million in 2005. Electricals strongest performance was in the fourth quarter, after generally flat results over the first three quarters of the year. EIS sold its Circuit Supply division in April of 2005, which impacted its overall growth rate. The ongoing Electrical operations were up 9% for the year, reflecting the continued strength in the manufacturing sector, which began to show improvement late in 2003. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $7.2 billion and $6.7 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing 68.7% of net sales in both years. After improving gross margins in each of the previous two years, our ongoing gross margin growth initiatives were offset in 2006 by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve. Our initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products, and minimize material acquisition costs lessened the effect of these negative margin pressures in 2006. Cost of goods sold in 2005 was $6.7 billion or 68.7% of net sales compared to $6.3 billion or 68.9% in 2004. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales reflects the success of our initiatives implemented to improve gross margins. These initiatives were initially developed to offset the usual competitive pricing pressures as well as lower levels of vendor discounts and volume incentives earned over the prior few years, especially in Industrial. Each of our business segments also experienced vendor price increases in 2005, and by working with our customers we were able to pass some of these along to them, particularly in Industrial. 14 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, administrative and other expenses (SGA) increased to $2.4 billion in 2006, representing 22.8% of sales and down slightly from 22.9% of sales in 2005. SGA expenses as a percentage of net sales reflect the benefits of our cost control initiatives. Our cost management initiatives continue to emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems. We were pleased with the success of our initiatives and expect our SGA expenses as a percentage of sales to show progress in the foreseeable future. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2006 was $73 million, up 12% from 2005, which relates to the increase in capital expenditures in the current year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $16 million in 2006, consistent with our bad debt expense in 2005. In 2005, SGA increased to $2.2 billion, or 22.9% of net sales, a slight increase from 22.8% of sales in 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2005 was $66 million, up 5% from 2004, and corresponds to the increase in capital expenditures in 2005 relative to the prior year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $16 million in 2005, down from $21 million in the prior year. This was due to our improved collections on accounts receivable balances relative to 2004, when the Company incurred unusually high bad debt losses. Non Operating Expenses Non operating expenses for the Company consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $32 million, $34 million and $39 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily due to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement. In 2005, the decrease in interest expense from the prior year relates to the repayment of borrowings during 2004 to its current level. In Other, interest income net of minority interests increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to the change in interest income earned on the Companys cash balances. Operating Profit Operating profit was $846 million in 2006, an increase of 7.4% from $788 million in 2005. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, was 8.1% in 2006, reflecting no change from our operating margin achieved in 2005 and 2004. Our constant operating margin over the last three years is primarily the result of specific short term margin issues in Automotive, which offset the benefits of our overall improvement in gross margin and SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales over these periods. We discuss these issues further below. We remain optimistic that our margins will show improvement in the year ahead. Automotive Group Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.7% in 2006 from 7.9% in 2005. During 2006, the Company recorded non recurring costs associated with certain closing and consolidation expenses at Johnson Industries and our re manufacturing operations. At Johnson Industries, we sold or closed eight of twelve locations during 2005, resulting in selling and closure costs in that year, and we incurred additional costs to downsize these operations in 2006. At our re manufacturing operations, we incurred costs during the year related to certain facility consolidations. Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.9% in 2005 from 8.4% in 2004. Despite showing progress in our core NAPA operations, Automotive was challenged with specific issues at Johnson Industries, as discussed above, and, within the re manufacturing operations, we made some price adjustments to certain product lines to drive sales growth, resulting in lower margins for this group relative to the prior year. We consider the issues reviewed for 2005 and 2006 to be short term challenges for this group and believe our Automotive operating margins will show improvement in the year ahead. Industrial Group Industrial operating margins increased to 8.3% in 2006 from 7.7% in 2005. This represents the third consecutive year of margin improvement for Industrial and reflects the effectiveness of our sales and operating initiatives, as well as the relative strength of the industries served by Industrial over these periods. Industrial operating margins increased to 7.7% in 2005 from 6.9% in 2004. This was the largest margin gain among our business segments in 2005 and reflects the strong performance at Industrial for the year. Office Group Operating margins in Office were 9.4% in 2006, down slightly from 9.5% in 2005. Office continues to generate industry leading operating margins despite competitive pricing pressures in the industry. These pressures are offset by ongoing product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services. Office operating margins were 9.5% in 2005, down from 9.8% in 2004. The success of this Groups sales initiatives was offset by pricing pressures, which resulted in the decrease in operating margin in 2005. Electrical Group Operating margins in Electrical increased to 5.5% in 2006 from 5.1% in 2005. This represents the third consecutive year of margin improvement for Electrical and reflects the continued strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy, combined with Electricals successful growth strategy during this three year period. Operating margins in Electrical increased to 5.1% in 2005 from 4.4% in 2004. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress we see in Electrical. 15 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.3% in 2006, unchanged from the effective rate in 2005. The effective income tax rate increased to 38.3% in 2005 from 37.8% in 2004. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher state income taxes in that year and favorable non recurring items in the prior year. Net Income Net income was $475 million in 2006, an increase of 9% from $437 million in 2005. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.76 in 2006 compared to $2.50 in 2005, up 10%. 2006 represents our third consecutive year of double digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Net income in 2006 and 2005 was 4.5% of net sales. Net income was $437 million in 2005, up 11% from $396 million in 2004, and on a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.50 in 2005 compared to $2.25 in 2004. Net income in 2005 was 4.5% of net sales compared to 4.3% in 2004. Share Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) choosing the modified prospective method. Compensation cost recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Most options may be exercised not earlier than twelve months nor later than ten years from the date of grant. As of January 1, 2006, there was approximately $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost for all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003 to employees that remained unvested prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R). This compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately four years. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately $20.2 million. The weighted average period over which this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is approximately three years. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, $11.9 million, $6.9 million and $2.5 million of share based compensation cost was recorded, respectively. There have been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Financial Condition The major consolidated balance sheet categories at December 31, 2006, with the exception of the accounts discussed below, were relatively consistent with the December 31, 2005 balance sheet categories. The Companys cash balances decreased $53 million or 28% from December 31, 2005, due primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments in capital expenditures. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 increased 3% compared to the prior year, which is less than our increase in revenues for the fourth quarter and year. Inventory at December 31, 2006, was up less than 1% from December 31, 2005, reflecting our continued emphasis on inventory management. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $20 million or 10% from December 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in receivables due from vendors. Accounts payable at December 31, 2006 decreased $63 million or 7% from the prior year, due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006 and the resulting decrease in days payables outstanding. Other assets at December 31, 2006 decreased $339 million or 67%; other long term liabilities increased $73 million or 64%; and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, included as a component of shareholders equity, was a loss of $243 million at December 31, 2006 compared to income of $46 million at December 31, 2005. These changes in other assets, other long term liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss were primarily due to the pension adjustments required by SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. Liquidity and Capital Resources The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.2 to 1 at December 31, 2006 compared to 3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2005. Our cash position remains strong. The Company had $500 million in total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005. A summary of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Net Cash (in thousands) Percent Change Provided by 2006 vs. 2005 vs. (Used in): 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Operating Activities $ 433,500 $ 440,517 $ 555,236 2 % 21 % Investing Activities (145,599 ) (70,174 ) (67,955 ) 107 % 3 % Financing Activities (340,729 ) (317,469 ) (369,328 ) 7 % 14 % 16 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company continues to generate excellent cash flows, with $434 million in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006. The 9% increase in net income was offset by the use of cash for working capital requirements during the year, resulting in a slight decrease in cash from operations compared to 2005. In 2005, the Company generated $441 million in cash from operations, a decrease from 2004. Despite an increase in net income in 2005, the 2005 operating cash flows were down from the prior year primarily due to an increase of $70 million in contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit plans. In addition, the Companys extended term negotiations and other working capital improvements in 2004 were especially favorable for operating cash flows in that year. The Company believes existing credit facilities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations, and to meet its cash requirements. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash flow used in investing activities was $146 million in 2006, up from the prior two years due primarily to increased spending for capital expenditures during the year. In 2006, capital expenditures were $126 million compared to approximately $86 million and $72 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company believes that 2006 was an extraordinary year for capital spending due in part to the timing of certain assets placed in service during the year. The Company expects its investment in capital expenditures to decrease to more customary levels in the foreseeable future. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities The Company used $341 million of cash in financing activities in 2006, primarily for dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of the Companys common stock. Dividends and share repurchases were also the primary financing activities in 2005, and in 2004, the primary financing activities were the dividend and repayment of borrowings. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $228 million, $216 million, and $209 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased $123 million, $119 million and $21 million, respectively, in Company stock. We plan to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually. While no borrowings were repaid in 2006 or 2005, the Company repaid variable rate borrowings of approximately $177 million in 2004. Long term debt of $500 million at December 31, 2006 is comprised of two $250 million term notes with a consortium of financial and insurance institutions due in 2008 and 2011. The Company does not anticipate repaying these notes prior to their scheduled expiration. The increasing dividends and fluctuations in cash used for share repurchases and the reduction of debt primarily explain the changes in cash used for financing activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Notes and Other Borrowings The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in October 2008 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .25%. (5.57% at December 31, 2006). At December 31, 2006 and 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. At December 31, 2006, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding under a $500 million financing arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series A, 5.86% fixed, due 2008; and $250 million, Series B, 6.23% fixed, due 2011. Certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to equity ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys outstanding borrowings was approximately 6.05% at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $26.4 million, $29.6 million and $37.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Construction and Lease Agreement The Company also has an $85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party. Properties acquired by the lessor are constructed and then leased to the Company under operating lease agreements. The total amount advanced and outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 2006 was approximately $84 million. Since the resulting leases are operating leases, no debt obligation is recorded on the Companys balance sheet. This construction and lease agreement expires in 2009 and no additional properties are being added to this agreement, as the construction term has ended. Lease payments fluctuate based upon current interest rates and are generally based upon LIBOR plus .50%. The lease agreement contains residual value guarantee provisions and guarantees under events of default. Although management believes the likelihood of funding to be remote, the maximum guarantee obligation, which represents our residual value guarantee, under the construction and lease agreement is approximately $73 million at December 31, 2006. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this arrangement. Contractual and Other Obligations The following table shows the Companys approximate obligations and commitments, excluding interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payment Due by Period Less than Over (in thousands) Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Credit facilities $ 500,000 $ $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ Capital leases 13,615 2,509 4,502 2,852 3,752 Operating leases 444,606 129,156 159,142 74,774 81,534 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 958,221 $ 131,665 $ 413,644 $ 327,626 $ 85,286 17 Table of Contents Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. As discussed in Construction and Lease Agreement above, the Company has approximately $84 million outstanding under a construction and lease agreement which expires in 2009. In addition, the Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a minority equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the Companys guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings. The following table shows the Companys approximate commercial commitments under these two arrangements as of December 31, 2006: Payment Due by Period Total Amounts Less than Over (in thousands) Committed 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates $ 186,473 $ 49,173 $ 21,309 $ 14,206 $ 101,785 Residual value guarantee under operating leases 72,640 72,640 Total Commercial Commitments $ 259,113 $ 49,173 $ 93,949 $ 14,206 $ 101,785 In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Contributions in 2006 were $67 million. We expect to make a cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2007, and contributions required for 2008 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Share Repurchases On April 19, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock, and on August 21, 2006, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares. Such repurchase plans were announced on April 20, 1999 and August 21, 2006, respectively. The authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased, or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2006, approximately 14.7 million shares have been repurchased under these authorizations. Critical Accounting Estimates General Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Companys inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur. 18 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Methodology The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of $16.5 million, $16.4 million and $20.7 million, respectively. Consideration Received from Vendors The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs. The Company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and, in the case of advertising allowances, upon completion of the Companys obligations related thereto. While management believes the Company will continue to receive such amounts in 2007 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating the impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Companys pension plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Companys management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary standards. The long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rate of return. Based on the investment policy for the U.S. pension plan, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Companys set allocations and future expectations, the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2007 pension expense or income is 8.25% for the U.S. plan. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships. The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a discount rate for the U.S. plan of 6.00% at December 31, 2006. Net periodic cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $48.2 million, $32.4 million, and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. These expenses are included in SGA expenses. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans. On September 29, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. SFAS No. 158 was effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2006. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the incremental effect of adopting SFAS No. 158. The Company has evaluated the potential impact of the Pension Protection Act (the Act), which was passed into law on August 17, 2006, on future U.S. pension plan funding requirements based on current market conditions. The Act is not anticipated to have a material effect on the level of future funding requirements or on the Companys liquidity and capital resources. 19 Table of Contents Quarterly Results of Operations The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes certain estimates in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discounts and volume incentives earned. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual October 31 book to physical inventory adjustment. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end. The effect of these adjustments in 2006 and 2005 was not significant. The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (in thousands except for per share data) 2006 Net Sales $ 2,553,552 $ 2,661,805 $ 2,699,641 $ 2,542,944 Gross Profit 803,477 825,182 831,295 815,541 Net Income 113,925 120,680 121,333 119,467 Earnings Per Share: Basic .66 .70 .71 .70 Diluted .66 .70 .71 .70 2005 Net Sales $ 2,342,201 $ 2,475,657 $ 2,555,503 $ 2,409,689 Gross Profit 736,480 761,257 778,502 787,847 Net Income 106,598 110,967 110,876 108,993 Earnings Per Share: Basic .61 .64 .64 .63 Diluted .61 .63 .63 .63 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in Item 1.A Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F 1 of this report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period. Overview Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. We have increased sales in 56 of the last 57 years and increased profits in 44 of the last 46 years. In 2006, business was conducted throughout the United States, in Puerto Rico, in Canada and in Mexico from approximately 2,000 locations. We recorded consolidated net sales of $10.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 7% compared to $9.8 billion in 2005. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $475 million, up 9% from $437 million in 2005. The combination of ongoing healthy economic conditions, strong end markets and effective internal initiatives provided us the opportunity to achieve another record level of sales and earnings in 2006. All four business segments contributed to our progress for the year, with each showing gains in revenues and profits. Our progress in 2006 follows 8% increases in revenues in both 2004 and 2005, and represents the third consecutive year of double digit growth in earnings per share. During the three year period ended December 31, 2006, the Company implemented a variety of growth initiatives, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and cost savings initiatives. Each of our business segments participated in developing these initiatives, as discussed further below. The major categories on the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet were relatively consistent with the December 31, 2005 balance sheet categories, subject to certain exceptions explained below. Our cash balances decreased $53 million or 28% from December 31, 2005, due primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments in capital expenditures. Accounts receivable grew $41 million or 3%, which is less than our increase in revenues, and inventory was up less than 1%. Accounts payable decreased $63 million or 7% from the prior year, due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006, resulting in the decrease in days payables outstanding. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 was unchanged from December 31, 2005. Results of Operations Our results of operations are summarized for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as follows: (in thousands, except per share data) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net Sales $ 10,457,942 $ 9,783,050 $ 9,097,267 Gross Profit 3,275,495 3,064,086 2,829,723 Net Income 475,405 437,434 395,552 Diluted Earnings Per Share 2.76 2.50 2.25 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $10.5 billion, another record sales level for the Company and a 7% increase from 2005. Again in 2006, each of our four business segments showed progress in revenues and contributed to our overall sales growth. We attribute this improvement to the ongoing good health of the national economy, strong end markets and effective growth initiatives. For the year, prices were up approximately 2% in the Automotive segment, 3% in the Industrial and Office segments and 7% in the Electrical segment. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $9.8 billion, an 8% increase from 2004. Similar to 2006, all of the business segments contributed to our sales growth in 2005, as our internal initiatives, healthy economy and positive trends in the industries we serve enhanced the sales volume in each of our four groups. Prices were up approximately 2% in the Automotive segment, 3% in the Office and Electrical segments and 6% in the Industrial segment in 2005. Automotive Group Net sales for the Automotive Group (Automotive) increased by 3% to $5.2 billion in 2006. After achieving sales increases of 5% in both the first and second quarters, our sales growth slowed to 1% growth in the third quarter, followed by a 2% increase in the fourth quarter. Automotives sales initiatives, including the addition of 64 net new NAPA AUTO PARTS stores and the continued expansion of NAPA AutoCare programs, were somewhat impacted by the effect of higher gasoline prices on vehicle miles driven and aftermarket product demand. Both of these factors influenced our sales trends for the year. Additionally, our core NAPA sales increase of 5% was offset by the sales decrease at Johnson Industries, which was downsized in 2005. 13 Table of Contents Automotive sales were $5.0 billion in 2005, an increase of 6% over 2004. Among the quarters in 2005, sales increases over the same period of the prior year ranged from an increase of 4% in the first quarter to 8% in the third quarter, our strongest period for the year. The continued effectiveness of our growth initiatives in this group, as well as positive industry trends, helped produce these results. As in 2006, stronger growth in our core NAPA operations was offset by a decrease in sales at Johnson Industries, where we sold eight of twelve operations during 2005. Industrial Group Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (Industrial), were $3.1 billion in 2006, an increase of 11% compared to 2005, and our third consecutive year of 11% sales growth. In 2006, this group recorded steady progress throughout the year, with double digit growth in each quarter. Industrial expanded its distribution network during the year by opening 10 new locations and by adding another 31 locations via two acquisitions. U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization indices also showed continued strength for the manufacturing sector in 2006, and based on current indices, the outlook remains positive for this sector in 2007. Net sales in 2005 were $2.8 billion, an 11% increase compared to 2004. In 2005, this group had double digit growth in each quarter except in the fourth quarter when sales increased 9%. Over the three year period ended December 31, 2006, Industrial has benefited from a combination of price increases common in the industry as well as stronger sales volume. Office Group Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group (Office), were $1.8 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. Among our business groups, Office is our most steady performer from year to year, and in 2006, product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services helped to drive this groups progress. Although its rate of sales growth decreased during the year, we were encouraged by the Office groups performance in 2006. Sales increased by 13% in the first quarter, 6% in the second quarter, 5% in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth quarter. Net sales in 2005 were $1.7 billion, up 8% over 2004. This represents a solid increase for the Office group and reflects the success of its ongoing business expansion strategy. Among the quarters, revenues grew stronger over the year, with sales increasing 6% in the first quarter, 8% in the second and third quarters and 10% in the fourth quarter. Electrical Group Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (Electrical), increased by 20% to $408 million in 2006. The strong performance at Electrical reflects the continued manufacturing expansion in the U.S., as well as this groups commitment to ongoing sales initiatives. In 2006, Electrical completed phase one of a sales process restructuring program developed to improve customer contact and maximize customer growth. For the year, sales were up 13% in the first quarter, 24% in the second quarter, 23% in the third quarter and 17% in the fourth quarter. Net sales were up 2% to $342 million in 2005. Electricals strongest performance was in the fourth quarter, after generally flat results over the first three quarters of the year. EIS sold its Circuit Supply division in April of 2005, which impacted its overall growth rate. The ongoing Electrical operations were up 9% for the year, reflecting the continued strength in the manufacturing sector, which began to show improvement late in 2003. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $7.2 billion and $6.7 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing 68.7% of net sales in both years. After improving gross margins in each of the previous two years, our ongoing gross margin growth initiatives were offset in 2006 by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve. Our initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products, and minimize material acquisition costs lessened the effect of these negative margin pressures in 2006. Cost of goods sold in 2005 was $6.7 billion or 68.7% of net sales compared to $6.3 billion or 68.9% in 2004. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales reflects the success of our initiatives implemented to improve gross margins. These initiatives were initially developed to offset the usual competitive pricing pressures as well as lower levels of vendor discounts and volume incentives earned over the prior few years, especially in Industrial. Each of our business segments also experienced vendor price increases in 2005, and by working with our customers we were able to pass some of these along to them, particularly in Industrial. 14 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Selling, administrative and other expenses (SGA) increased to $2.4 billion in 2006, representing 22.8% of sales and down slightly from 22.9% of sales in 2005. SGA expenses as a percentage of net sales reflect the benefits of our cost control initiatives. Our cost management initiatives continue to emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems. We were pleased with the success of our initiatives and expect our SGA expenses as a percentage of sales to show progress in the foreseeable future. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2006 was $73 million, up 12% from 2005, which relates to the increase in capital expenditures in the current year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $16 million in 2006, consistent with our bad debt expense in 2005. In 2005, SGA increased to $2.2 billion, or 22.9% of net sales, a slight increase from 22.8% of sales in 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2005 was $66 million, up 5% from 2004, and corresponds to the increase in capital expenditures in 2005 relative to the prior year. The provision for doubtful accounts was $16 million in 2005, down from $21 million in the prior year. This was due to our improved collections on accounts receivable balances relative to 2004, when the Company incurred unusually high bad debt losses. Non Operating Expenses Non operating expenses for the Company consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $32 million, $34 million and $39 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily due to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement. In 2005, the decrease in interest expense from the prior year relates to the repayment of borrowings during 2004 to its current level. In Other, interest income net of minority interests increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to the change in interest income earned on the Companys cash balances. Operating Profit Operating profit was $846 million in 2006, an increase of 7.4% from $788 million in 2005. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, was 8.1% in 2006, reflecting no change from our operating margin achieved in 2005 and 2004. Our constant operating margin over the last three years is primarily the result of specific short term margin issues in Automotive, which offset the benefits of our overall improvement in gross margin and SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales over these periods. We discuss these issues further below. We remain optimistic that our margins will show improvement in the year ahead. Automotive Group Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.7% in 2006 from 7.9% in 2005. During 2006, the Company recorded non recurring costs associated with certain closing and consolidation expenses at Johnson Industries and our re manufacturing operations. At Johnson Industries, we sold or closed eight of twelve locations during 2005, resulting in selling and closure costs in that year, and we incurred additional costs to downsize these operations in 2006. At our re manufacturing operations, we incurred costs during the year related to certain facility consolidations. Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.9% in 2005 from 8.4% in 2004. Despite showing progress in our core NAPA operations, Automotive was challenged with specific issues at Johnson Industries, as discussed above, and, within the re manufacturing operations, we made some price adjustments to certain product lines to drive sales growth, resulting in lower margins for this group relative to the prior year. We consider the issues reviewed for 2005 and 2006 to be short term challenges for this group and believe our Automotive operating margins will show improvement in the year ahead. Industrial Group Industrial operating margins increased to 8.3% in 2006 from 7.7% in 2005. This represents the third consecutive year of margin improvement for Industrial and reflects the effectiveness of our sales and operating initiatives, as well as the relative strength of the industries served by Industrial over these periods. Industrial operating margins increased to 7.7% in 2005 from 6.9% in 2004. This was the largest margin gain among our business segments in 2005 and reflects the strong performance at Industrial for the year. Office Group Operating margins in Office were 9.4% in 2006, down slightly from 9.5% in 2005. Office continues to generate industry leading operating margins despite competitive pricing pressures in the industry. These pressures are offset by ongoing product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services. Office operating margins were 9.5% in 2005, down from 9.8% in 2004. The success of this Groups sales initiatives was offset by pricing pressures, which resulted in the decrease in operating margin in 2005. Electrical Group Operating margins in Electrical increased to 5.5% in 2006 from 5.1% in 2005. This represents the third consecutive year of margin improvement for Electrical and reflects the continued strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy, combined with Electricals successful growth strategy during this three year period. Operating margins in Electrical increased to 5.1% in 2005 from 4.4% in 2004. We are encouraged by the ongoing progress we see in Electrical. 15 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.3% in 2006, unchanged from the effective rate in 2005. The effective income tax rate increased to 38.3% in 2005 from 37.8% in 2004. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher state income taxes in that year and favorable non recurring items in the prior year. Net Income Net income was $475 million in 2006, an increase of 9% from $437 million in 2005. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.76 in 2006 compared to $2.50 in 2005, up 10%. 2006 represents our third consecutive year of double digit growth in diluted earnings per share. Net income in 2006 and 2005 was 4.5% of net sales. Net income was $437 million in 2005, up 11% from $396 million in 2004, and on a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.50 in 2005 compared to $2.25 in 2004. Net income in 2005 was 4.5% of net sales compared to 4.3% in 2004. Share Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R) choosing the modified prospective method. Compensation cost recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Most options may be exercised not earlier than twelve months nor later than ten years from the date of grant. As of January 1, 2006, there was approximately $1.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost for all awards granted prior to January 1, 2003 to employees that remained unvested prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R). This compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately four years. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately $20.2 million. The weighted average period over which this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is approximately three years. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, $11.9 million, $6.9 million and $2.5 million of share based compensation cost was recorded, respectively. There have been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Financial Condition The major consolidated balance sheet categories at December 31, 2006, with the exception of the accounts discussed below, were relatively consistent with the December 31, 2005 balance sheet categories. The Companys cash balances decreased $53 million or 28% from December 31, 2005, due primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments in capital expenditures. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 increased 3% compared to the prior year, which is less than our increase in revenues for the fourth quarter and year. Inventory at December 31, 2006, was up less than 1% from December 31, 2005, reflecting our continued emphasis on inventory management. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $20 million or 10% from December 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in receivables due from vendors. Accounts payable at December 31, 2006 decreased $63 million or 7% from the prior year, due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006 and the resulting decrease in days payables outstanding. Other assets at December 31, 2006 decreased $339 million or 67%; other long term liabilities increased $73 million or 64%; and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, included as a component of shareholders equity, was a loss of $243 million at December 31, 2006 compared to income of $46 million at December 31, 2005. These changes in other assets, other long term liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss were primarily due to the pension adjustments required by SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. Liquidity and Capital Resources The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.2 to 1 at December 31, 2006 compared to 3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2005. Our cash position remains strong. The Company had $500 million in total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005. A summary of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Net Cash (in thousands) Percent Change Provided by 2006 vs. 2005 vs. (Used in): 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 Operating Activities $ 433,500 $ 440,517 $ 555,236 2 % 21 % Investing Activities (145,599 ) (70,174 ) (67,955 ) 107 % 3 % Financing Activities (340,729 ) (317,469 ) (369,328 ) 7 % 14 % 16 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company continues to generate excellent cash flows, with $434 million in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006. The 9% increase in net income was offset by the use of cash for working capital requirements during the year, resulting in a slight decrease in cash from operations compared to 2005. In 2005, the Company generated $441 million in cash from operations, a decrease from 2004. Despite an increase in net income in 2005, the 2005 operating cash flows were down from the prior year primarily due to an increase of $70 million in contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit plans. In addition, the Companys extended term negotiations and other working capital improvements in 2004 were especially favorable for operating cash flows in that year. The Company believes existing credit facilities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations, and to meet its cash requirements. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash flow used in investing activities was $146 million in 2006, up from the prior two years due primarily to increased spending for capital expenditures during the year. In 2006, capital expenditures were $126 million compared to approximately $86 million and $72 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company believes that 2006 was an extraordinary year for capital spending due in part to the timing of certain assets placed in service during the year. The Company expects its investment in capital expenditures to decrease to more customary levels in the foreseeable future. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities The Company used $341 million of cash in financing activities in 2006, primarily for dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of the Companys common stock. Dividends and share repurchases were also the primary financing activities in 2005, and in 2004, the primary financing activities were the dividend and repayment of borrowings. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $228 million, $216 million, and $209 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased $123 million, $119 million and $21 million, respectively, in Company stock. We plan to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually. While no borrowings were repaid in 2006 or 2005, the Company repaid variable rate borrowings of approximately $177 million in 2004. Long term debt of $500 million at December 31, 2006 is comprised of two $250 million term notes with a consortium of financial and insurance institutions due in 2008 and 2011. The Company does not anticipate repaying these notes prior to their scheduled expiration. The increasing dividends and fluctuations in cash used for share repurchases and the reduction of debt primarily explain the changes in cash used for financing activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Notes and Other Borrowings The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in October 2008 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .25%. (5.57% at December 31, 2006). At December 31, 2006 and 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. At December 31, 2006, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding under a $500 million financing arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series A, 5.86% fixed, due 2008; and $250 million, Series B, 6.23% fixed, due 2011. Certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to equity ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys outstanding borrowings was approximately 6.05% at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $26.4 million, $29.6 million and $37.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Construction and Lease Agreement The Company also has an $85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party. Properties acquired by the lessor are constructed and then leased to the Company under operating lease agreements. The total amount advanced and outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 2006 was approximately $84 million. Since the resulting leases are operating leases, no debt obligation is recorded on the Companys balance sheet. This construction and lease agreement expires in 2009 and no additional properties are being added to this agreement, as the construction term has ended. Lease payments fluctuate based upon current interest rates and are generally based upon LIBOR plus .50%. The lease agreement contains residual value guarantee provisions and guarantees under events of default. Although management believes the likelihood of funding to be remote, the maximum guarantee obligation, which represents our residual value guarantee, under the construction and lease agreement is approximately $73 million at December 31, 2006. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this arrangement. Contractual and Other Obligations The following table shows the Companys approximate obligations and commitments, excluding interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payment Due by Period Less than Over (in thousands) Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Credit facilities $ 500,000 $ $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ Capital leases 13,615 2,509 4,502 2,852 3,752 Operating leases 444,606 129,156 159,142 74,774 81,534 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 958,221 $ 131,665 $ 413,644 $ 327,626 $ 85,286 17 Table of Contents Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. As discussed in Construction and Lease Agreement above, the Company has approximately $84 million outstanding under a construction and lease agreement which expires in 2009. In addition, the Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a minority equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the Companys guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings. The following table shows the Companys approximate commercial commitments under these two arrangements as of December 31, 2006: Payment Due by Period Total Amounts Less than Over (in thousands) Committed 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates $ 186,473 $ 49,173 $ 21,309 $ 14,206 $ 101,785 Residual value guarantee under operating leases 72,640 72,640 Total Commercial Commitments $ 259,113 $ 49,173 $ 93,949 $ 14,206 $ 101,785 In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Contributions in 2006 were $67 million. We expect to make a cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2007, and contributions required for 2008 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Share Repurchases On April 19, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock, and on August 21, 2006, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares. Such repurchase plans were announced on April 20, 1999 and August 21, 2006, respectively. The authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased, or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2006, approximately 14.7 million shares have been repurchased under these authorizations. Critical Accounting Estimates General Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Companys inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur. 18 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Methodology The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of $16.5 million, $16.4 million and $20.7 million, respectively. Consideration Received from Vendors The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs. The Company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and, in the case of advertising allowances, upon completion of the Companys obligations related thereto. While management believes the Company will continue to receive such amounts in 2007 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating the impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Companys pension plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Companys management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary standards. The long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rate of return. Based on the investment policy for the U.S. pension plan, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Companys set allocations and future expectations, the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2007 pension expense or income is 8.25% for the U.S. plan. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships. The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a discount rate for the U.S. plan of 6.00% at December 31, 2006. Net periodic cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $48.2 million, $32.4 million, and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. These expenses are included in SGA expenses. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans. On September 29, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. SFAS No. 158 was effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2006. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the incremental effect of adopting SFAS No. 158. The Company has evaluated the potential impact of the Pension Protection Act (the Act), which was passed into law on August 17, 2006, on future U.S. pension plan funding requirements based on current market conditions. The Act is not anticipated to have a material effect on the level of future funding requirements or on the Companys liquidity and capital resources. 19 Table of Contents Quarterly Results of Operations The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes certain estimates in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discounts and volume incentives earned. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual October 31 book to physical inventory adjustment. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end. The effect of these adjustments in 2006 and 2005 was not significant. The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (in thousands except for per share data) 2006 Net Sales $ 2,553,552 $ 2,661,805 $ 2,699,641 $ 2,542,944 Gross Profit 803,477 825,182 831,295 815,541 Net Income 113,925 120,680 121,333 119,467 Earnings Per Share: Basic .66 .70 .71 .70 Diluted .66 .70 .71 .70 2005 Net Sales $ 2,342,201 $ 2,475,657 $ 2,555,503 $ 2,409,689 Gross Profit 736,480 761,257 778,502 787,847 Net Income 106,598 110,967 110,876 108,993 Earnings Per Share: Basic .61 .64 .64 .63 Diluted .61 .63 .63 .63 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
