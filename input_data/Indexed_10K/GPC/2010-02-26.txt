MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2009, business was conducted throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico from approximately 2,000 locations. We recorded consolidated net sales of $10.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 9% compared to $11.0 billion in 2008. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $400 million, down 16% from $475 million in 2008. The effects of the economic slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008, adversely impacted the results in all four of our business segments throughout 2009. Our businesses were impacted by the effects of reduced consumer spending, lower levels of industrial production and higher unemployment, which we discuss further below. Our 2009 revenue decrease of 9% follows a 2% and 4% increase in revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our 16% decrease in net income follows a 6% decrease in 2008 and a 7% increase in 2007. In each of the three years preceding 2007, the Company had experienced double digit earnings growth. Throughout these periods, the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. The prevailing economic conditions of the last two years have offset these initiatives, as reflected in our earnings for 2008 and 2009. The following discussion addresses the major categories on the December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet. The Companys cash balance of $337 million was up $269 million from $68 million at December 31, 2008. 14 Table of Contents This improvement is due mainly to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008. In addition, we were less active in our share repurchase program during 2009 when compared to 2008. Accounts receivable decreased by approximately 3%, inventory was down by approximately 4% and accounts payable increased $85 million or 8% from the prior year, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 was unchanged from $500 million at December 31, 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands except per share data) Net Sales $ 10,057,512 $ 11,015,263 $ 10,843,195 Gross Profit 3,009,762 3,272,490 3,217,223 Net Income 399,575 475,417 506,339 Diluted Earnings Per Share 2.50 2.92 2.98 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $10.1 billion, a 9% decrease from 2008. Each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases, with the Industrial and Electrical business segments showing the most significant declines, as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions of the last 15 months. Fortunately, the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment seemed to stabilize over the last half of the year. Among the four quarters in 2009, the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment. Cumulatively, prices in 2009 were down approximately 3% in the Automotive segment, approximately flat in the Industrial segment and up approximately 4% in the Office segment and 2% in the Electrical segment. Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $11.0 billion, a 2% increase from 2007. In 2008, the Industrial and Electrical business segments showed the strongest sales growth among our operations, while the Automotive and Office segments continued to experience sluggish growth. For the year, Automotive reported a slight sales increase, while Office reported a decrease in revenues. For 2008, prices were up approximately 6% in the Automotive segment, 8% in the Industrial and Electrical segments and 4% in the Office segment. These price increases reflect the highest inflationary period for the Company in many years. Automotive Group Net sales for the Automotive Group (Automotive) were $5.2 billion in 2009, a decrease of 2% from 2008. Sales were impacted by the soft economy, which has reduced the overall level of consumer spending and, specifically, the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items. The first half of the year proved to be the most challenging, with Automotive sales down 7% and 5% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Sales were down 1% in the third quarter followed by a 6% increase in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include acquisitions, which had an approximately 1% positive effect on sales, and the negative effect of currency, which negatively impacted sales by approximately 2%. Automotive sales were $5.3 billion in 2008, essentially flat compared to 2007. Our rate of growth decreased during each quarter of the year, from 3% to 2% to 1% in the first, second and third quarters of 2008, respectively. This downward trend was partly due to the impact of the decrease in miles driven caused by high gas prices over most of the year. Demand weakened further in the fourth quarter of 2008, as evidenced by the decrease in consumer spending, resulting in a 6% sales decrease from the final quarter of 2007. This is consistent with historical patterns during a softening economy, when consumers defer or forego discretionary spending on automotive maintenance and supply items. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include acquisitions, which had a slightly positive effect on sales. 15 Table of Contents Industrial Group Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (Industrial), were $2.9 billion in 2009, a decrease of 18% compared to 2008. Through the first three quarters of the year, sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity, as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization, and its negative impact on demand for industrial products. This weakness was widespread, as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories. The industrial indices we follow seemed to show some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter. Industrial sales were down 11% in the fourth quarter, which marks a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year. In 2009, sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 3% of Industrials sales growth for the year. Net sales were $3.5 billion in 2008, an increase of 5% compared to 2007. Through the first three quarters of the year, sales held strong and were relatively consistent from quarter to quarter, increasing 6% in the first quarter and 7% in the second and third quarters. The fourth quarter proved to be more difficult for this business, due to the deteriorating economic environment, including worsening manufacturing production trends, and sales for the period were even with the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2008, sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions, which accounted for nearly 2% of Industrials sales for the year. Office Group Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group (Office), were $1.6 billion in 2009, down 5% compared to the prior year. 2009 represents the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for Office and reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption, a trend that began in 2007. During the year, sales improved sequentially, with decreases of 7%, 6%, 5% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. For the year, sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008, which contributed nearly 3% to sales in Office. The increase in net sales due to acquisitions, as well as our sales initiatives, was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry. Net sales for 2008 were $1.7 billion, down 2% compared to 2007. This decline was indicative of the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption. During the year, sales were down 2% in the first quarter and even with the prior year periods in the second and third quarters. Demand in the fourth quarter worsened, consistent with the significant increase in unemployment for the period, and sales were down 5% from the 2007 fourth quarter. For the year, sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions, which contributed nearly 2% to sales in Office. Electrical Group Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (Electrical), decreased to $346 million in 2009, down 26% from 2008. Electrical sales declined by 25% in the first quarter, 34% in the second quarter and 30% in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, sales were down 12%. Manufacturing contraction, as measured by the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index, was evident through June and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year. This factor, which we deem as positive for 2010, helps explain the quarterly sales trends at Electrical in 2009. Acquisitions had less than a 1% positive impact on Electrical sales in 2009. Net sales increased by 7% to $466 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Electrical sales were strong through the first nine months of the year, increasing 7% in the first quarter, 11% in the second quarter and 13% in the third quarter. The deteriorating economy had a significant impact on this business in the fourth quarter and sales decreased 4% from the same period in 2007. Acquisitions during the year had a positive 2% impact on Electrical sales in 2008 and, combined with Electricals sales initiatives, partially offset the weakening conditions in the marketplace in the last quarter of the year. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $7.0 billion, $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 9% decrease in cost of goods sold from 2008 to 2009 is consistent with the sales decrease. Cost of goods sold 16 Table of Contents represented 70.1% of net sales in 2009 and 70.3% of net sales in 2008 and 2007. The relatively constant rate over these three periods reflects how our ongoing gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs were generally offset by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve. In 2009, our Office and Electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases. Industrial was flat and Automotive pricing was down for the year. In 2008 and 2007, all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases. In any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them. Operating Expenses Selling, administrative and other expenses (SGA) decreased by $140 million to $2.2 billion in 2009, representing 22.1% of net sales and up from 21.4% of net sales in 2008. SGA expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from the prior year due primarily to the loss of expense leverage associated with the 9% sales decrease for the year. During 2009, management continued its implementation of extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage. These measures emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems and, for the year, we eliminated approximately $70 million in operating costs. Examples of such savings include costs associated with personnel, freight, fleet and logistics, among others. The Company reduced its workforce by 7% in 2009 (before consideration of acquisitions) and this follows a 5% reduction in employees in 2008. Severance and other termination benefits associated with these employee reductions were insignificant. Our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses and the need for additional cost reductions, while maintaining our high standards for excellent customer service. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was $90 million, up slightly from 2008. The provision for doubtful accounts was $28 million in 2009, up from a $24 million bad debt expense in 2008. Our bad debt expense reflects an increase in uncollectible accounts receivables in 2009 and is likely directly correlated to the ongoing effects of the difficult economic climate, which has pressured certain of our customers. We believe the Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at December 31, 2009. In 2008, SGA was $2.4 billion, or 21.4% of net sales, which was an increase from 2007 when SGA as a percentage of net sales was 21.0%. This increase was mainly due to the loss of leverage on the lower level of sales growth in 2008 relative to the prior year, which offset the benefits of our ongoing cost control initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 was $89 million, relatively consistent with 2007. The provision for doubtful accounts was $24 million in 2008, up from a $14 million bad debt expense in 2007. Total share based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $8.6 million, $13.0 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding share based compensation. Non Operating Expenses and Income Non operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $28 million in 2009, a decrease from $32 million and $31 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease is the result of an improved interest rate on certain long term debt, effective November 2008. In Other, interest income net of noncontrolling interests increased in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009. In 2008, interest income net of noncontrolling interests decreased from 2007 due to the effects of lower interest rates. Income Before Income Taxes Income before income taxes was $644 million in 2009, a decrease of 16.0% from $768 million in 2008. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 6.4% in 2009, reflecting a decrease from 7.0% in 2008. In 2008, income before income taxes of $768 million was down 5.9% from $817 million in 2007 and as a percentage of net sales was 7.0%, a decrease from 7.5% in 2007. 17 Table of Contents Automotive Group Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 7.4% in 2009 from 7.2% in 2008. The improvement in operating margin for 2009 is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during 2008 and 2009. Automotives initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead. Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.2% in 2008 from 7.8% in 2007. The decline in operating margin for 2008 is attributed to Automotives lower sales volume for the year, partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction measures. Industrial Group Industrial operating margins decreased to 5.6% in 2009 from 8.4% in 2008 and 2007. The decrease in operating margins in 2009 was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. These conditions led to lower levels of sales volume in 2009, which severely impacted our expense leverage, despite our cost reduction efforts. In addition, the decrease in inventory purchases in 2009, a direct result of lower sales, significantly reduced the level of volume incentives earned during the year. These factors more than offset our sales initiatives and cost reduction efforts. We will continue to focus on these areas, however, to show progress in the years ahead. Office Group Operating margins in Office were 7.7% in 2009, down from 8.3% in 2008 and 8.9% in 2007. The prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in 2007 continued to pressure the operating margins at Office in 2009. The decrease in revenues for these three periods has negatively impacted our expense leverage. Our sales strategy remains to capture additional market share, despite the industry slowdown. Electrical Group Operating margins in Electrical decreased to 7.3% in 2009 from 7.9% in 2008. In 2008, the Electrical operating margins had increased to 7.9% from 7.0% in 2007 and marked the fifth consecutive year of operating margin improvement for Electrical. In 2009, the decrease in operating margins was primarily a function of weak market conditions. This factor outweighed the benefits of Electricals sales initiatives and expense savings. Ongoing efforts in these areas, as well as a more stable manufacturing sector, will serve to improve Electricals future operating margins. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate decreased to 38.0% in 2009 from 38.1% in 2008. The decrease from the 2008 rate is mainly due to tax free income in 2009 associated with a Company retirement plan. The 38.1% tax rate in 2008 had increased from 38.0% in 2007. The increase from the prior year rate was mainly due to a non deductible expense associated with a Company retirement plan. Net Income Net income was $400 million in 2009, a decrease of 16% from $475 million in 2008. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.50 in 2009 compared to $2.92 in 2008, down 14%. Net income in 2009 was 4.0% of net sales compared to 4.3% of net sales in 2008. Net income was $475 million in 2008, a decrease of 6% from $506 million in 2007. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.92 in 2008 compared to $2.98 in 2007, down 2%. Net income in 2008 was 4.3% of net sales compared to 4.7% of net sales in 2007. 18 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION The following is a discussion of the Companys financial condition at December 31, 2009. Our cash balance of $337 million was up $269 million from December 31, 2008, due primarily to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008. In addition, we were less active in our Company share repurchase program in 2009 when compared to 2008. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2009 decreased by approximately 3% from the prior year and inventory at December 31, 2009 was down by approximately 4% from December 31, 2008. Both of these decreases reflect our decline in sales for the year. Accounts payable increased $85 million or approximately 8% from December 31, 2008, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by $13 million or 8% from December 31, 2008 and relates primarily to the Companys acquisitions during the year. The change in our December 31, 2009 balances for deferred taxes, down $51 million, as well as pension and other post retirement benefits liabilities, down $202 million, is primarily due to a pension contribution of $53 million and a change in funded status of the Companys pension and other post retirement plans in 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $500 million of long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, of which $250 million matures in 2011 and $250 million matures in 2013. The capital and credit markets continue to be volatile and if these conditions continue they are likely to impact our access to these markets. Currently, we believe that our available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Companys operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.9 to 1 at December 31, 2009 compared to 3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2008. Our liquidity position remains solid. The Company had $500 million in total debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company had available a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Sources and Uses of Net Cash A summary of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Change Net Cash Provided by (Used in): 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In thousands) Operating Activities $ 845,298 $ 530,309 $ 641,471 59 % (17 )% Investing Activities (264,420 ) (214,334 ) (87,598 ) 23 % 145 % Financing Activities (330,383 ) (472,573 ) (469,496 ) (30 )% 1 % Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: The Company continues to generate cash and 2009 was an especially strong year, with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $845 million in 2009. This represents a 59% increase from 2008, and primarily relates to the $368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, net of the $76 million decrease in net income from 2008. The 17% decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was primarily due to the $116 million net increase in cash used for working capital requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, as well as the $31 million decrease in net income from 2007. 19 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Net cash flow used in investing activities was $264 million in 2009 compared to $214 million in 2008, an increase of 23%. Primarily, the increase in investing activities was due to the $73 million used in 2009 for the purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement, net of the $36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008. In 2008, the change in investing activities was primarily due to the $89 million increase in cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2008 and the $56 million decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets during the year, relative to 2007. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: The Company used $330 million of cash in financing activities in 2009, a 30% decrease from the $473 million used in financing activities in 2008. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was relatively consistent with 2007. For the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and the repurchase of the Companys common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $254 million, $252 million and $243 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased $26 million, $273 million and $241 million, respectively, of the Companys common stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually. Notes and Other Borrowings The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .30%. (0.53% at December 31, 2009). At December 31, 2009 and 2008, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. Due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $50 million and $51 million outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding under a $500 million financing arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series B, 6.23% fixed, due 2011; and $250 million senior unsecured note, 4.67% fixed, due 2013. Certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys outstanding borrowings was approximately 5.45% at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $27.1 million, $29.8 million and $21.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Construction and Lease Agreement The Company had an $85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party which expired in 2009. Under the agreement, the third party constructed facilities and leased them to the Company. Upon expiration of the agreement, the Company purchased the properties from the lessor for $73 million, including closing costs, which was paid in July 2009. These properties have been included in property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this arrangement. Contractual and Other Obligations In October 2007, the Company entered into a sale leaseback transaction with a financial institution. In connection with the transaction, the Company sold certain automotive retail store properties and immediately leased the properties back over a lease term of twenty years. The lease was classified as an operating lease. Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately $56 million. The Company realized a net gain of approximately $20 million, which was deferred and is being amortized over the lease term. 20 Table of Contents The following table shows the Companys approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Contractual Obligations Payment Due by Period Less Than Over Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Credit facilities $ 575,579 $ 27,250 $ 287,627 $ 260,702 $ Capital leases 6,069 1,296 1,934 1,557 1,282 Operating leases 530,608 129,928 175,905 95,565 129,210 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,112,256 $ 158,474 $ 465,466 $ 357,824 $ 130,492 Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $41 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the Companys guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings. The following table shows the Companys approximate commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009: Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total Amounts Less Than Over Committed 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Line of Credit $ $ $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 50,403 50,403 Guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates 200,857 61,622 13,220 13,220 112,795 Total commercial commitments $ 251,260 $ 112,025 $ 13,220 $ 13,220 $ 112,795 In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Contributions in 2009 were $56 million. Contributions required for 2010 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Share Repurchases On August 21, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock, and on November 17, 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares. Such 21 Table of Contents repurchase plans were announced on August 21, 2006 and November 17, 2008, respectively. The authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the Board of Directors. In 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 722,000 shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 17.8 million shares at December 31, 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES General Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Companys inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Methodology The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of $28.5 million, $23.9 million, and $13.5 million, respectively. Consideration Received from Vendors The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs. The Company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and, in the case of advertising allowances, upon completion of the Companys obligations related thereto. While management believes the Company will continue to receive such amounts in 2010 22 Table of Contents and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Companys pension plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Companys management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary standards. The long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rate of return. The Companys investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% SP Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit). We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. Based on the investment policy for the pension plan, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Companys asset allocations and future expectations, the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2010 pension expense or income is 8.00% for the plan. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships. The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the U.S. plans of 6.54% at December 31, 2009. Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $7.3 million, $46.9 million and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decreasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurment which is discussed below, and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans. In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4.3 million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization, which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1, 2010, future retirees will no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre 65 retirees will no longer receive employer provided post 65 benefits (beyond an access only arrangement). 23 Table of Contents QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (In thousands except per share data) 2009 Net Sales $ 2,444,496 $ 2,535,045 $ 2,606,757 $ 2,471,214 Gross Profit 732,201 744,855 765,246 767,460 Net Income 89,159 103,610 107,639 99,167 Earnings Per Share: Basic .56 .65 .67 .62 Diluted .56 .65 .67 .62 2008 Net Sales $ 2,739,473 $ 2,873,485 $ 2,882,115 $ 2,520,190 Gross Profit 819,483 852,213 849,005 751,789 Net Income 123,543 133,073 131,017 87,784 Earnings Per Share: Basic .75 .81 .81 .55 Diluted .75 .81 .81 .55 We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share. The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes certain estimates in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual October 31 book to physical inventory adjustment. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end. The effect of these adjustments in 2009 and 2008 was not significant.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Although the Company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses. Foreign Currency The Company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating units foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. The Companys principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, negatively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009 and 2008, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $104 million and $118 million, respectively. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2009, business was conducted throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico from approximately 2,000 locations. We recorded consolidated net sales of $10.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of 9% compared to $11.0 billion in 2008. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $400 million, down 16% from $475 million in 2008. The effects of the economic slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008, adversely impacted the results in all four of our business segments throughout 2009. Our businesses were impacted by the effects of reduced consumer spending, lower levels of industrial production and higher unemployment, which we discuss further below. Our 2009 revenue decrease of 9% follows a 2% and 4% increase in revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our 16% decrease in net income follows a 6% decrease in 2008 and a 7% increase in 2007. In each of the three years preceding 2007, the Company had experienced double digit earnings growth. Throughout these periods, the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. The prevailing economic conditions of the last two years have offset these initiatives, as reflected in our earnings for 2008 and 2009. The following discussion addresses the major categories on the December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet. The Companys cash balance of $337 million was up $269 million from $68 million at December 31, 2008. 14 Table of Contents This improvement is due mainly to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008. In addition, we were less active in our share repurchase program during 2009 when compared to 2008. Accounts receivable decreased by approximately 3%, inventory was down by approximately 4% and accounts payable increased $85 million or 8% from the prior year, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 was unchanged from $500 million at December 31, 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands except per share data) Net Sales $ 10,057,512 $ 11,015,263 $ 10,843,195 Gross Profit 3,009,762 3,272,490 3,217,223 Net Income 399,575 475,417 506,339 Diluted Earnings Per Share 2.50 2.92 2.98 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $10.1 billion, a 9% decrease from 2008. Each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases, with the Industrial and Electrical business segments showing the most significant declines, as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions of the last 15 months. Fortunately, the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment seemed to stabilize over the last half of the year. Among the four quarters in 2009, the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment. Cumulatively, prices in 2009 were down approximately 3% in the Automotive segment, approximately flat in the Industrial segment and up approximately 4% in the Office segment and 2% in the Electrical segment. Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $11.0 billion, a 2% increase from 2007. In 2008, the Industrial and Electrical business segments showed the strongest sales growth among our operations, while the Automotive and Office segments continued to experience sluggish growth. For the year, Automotive reported a slight sales increase, while Office reported a decrease in revenues. For 2008, prices were up approximately 6% in the Automotive segment, 8% in the Industrial and Electrical segments and 4% in the Office segment. These price increases reflect the highest inflationary period for the Company in many years. Automotive Group Net sales for the Automotive Group (Automotive) were $5.2 billion in 2009, a decrease of 2% from 2008. Sales were impacted by the soft economy, which has reduced the overall level of consumer spending and, specifically, the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items. The first half of the year proved to be the most challenging, with Automotive sales down 7% and 5% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Sales were down 1% in the third quarter followed by a 6% increase in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include acquisitions, which had an approximately 1% positive effect on sales, and the negative effect of currency, which negatively impacted sales by approximately 2%. Automotive sales were $5.3 billion in 2008, essentially flat compared to 2007. Our rate of growth decreased during each quarter of the year, from 3% to 2% to 1% in the first, second and third quarters of 2008, respectively. This downward trend was partly due to the impact of the decrease in miles driven caused by high gas prices over most of the year. Demand weakened further in the fourth quarter of 2008, as evidenced by the decrease in consumer spending, resulting in a 6% sales decrease from the final quarter of 2007. This is consistent with historical patterns during a softening economy, when consumers defer or forego discretionary spending on automotive maintenance and supply items. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include acquisitions, which had a slightly positive effect on sales. 15 Table of Contents Industrial Group Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (Industrial), were $2.9 billion in 2009, a decrease of 18% compared to 2008. Through the first three quarters of the year, sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity, as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization, and its negative impact on demand for industrial products. This weakness was widespread, as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories. The industrial indices we follow seemed to show some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter. Industrial sales were down 11% in the fourth quarter, which marks a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year. In 2009, sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 3% of Industrials sales growth for the year. Net sales were $3.5 billion in 2008, an increase of 5% compared to 2007. Through the first three quarters of the year, sales held strong and were relatively consistent from quarter to quarter, increasing 6% in the first quarter and 7% in the second and third quarters. The fourth quarter proved to be more difficult for this business, due to the deteriorating economic environment, including worsening manufacturing production trends, and sales for the period were even with the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2008, sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions, which accounted for nearly 2% of Industrials sales for the year. Office Group Net sales for S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group (Office), were $1.6 billion in 2009, down 5% compared to the prior year. 2009 represents the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for Office and reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption, a trend that began in 2007. During the year, sales improved sequentially, with decreases of 7%, 6%, 5% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. For the year, sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008, which contributed nearly 3% to sales in Office. The increase in net sales due to acquisitions, as well as our sales initiatives, was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry. Net sales for 2008 were $1.7 billion, down 2% compared to 2007. This decline was indicative of the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption. During the year, sales were down 2% in the first quarter and even with the prior year periods in the second and third quarters. Demand in the fourth quarter worsened, consistent with the significant increase in unemployment for the period, and sales were down 5% from the 2007 fourth quarter. For the year, sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions, which contributed nearly 2% to sales in Office. Electrical Group Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (Electrical), decreased to $346 million in 2009, down 26% from 2008. Electrical sales declined by 25% in the first quarter, 34% in the second quarter and 30% in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, sales were down 12%. Manufacturing contraction, as measured by the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index, was evident through June and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year. This factor, which we deem as positive for 2010, helps explain the quarterly sales trends at Electrical in 2009. Acquisitions had less than a 1% positive impact on Electrical sales in 2009. Net sales increased by 7% to $466 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Electrical sales were strong through the first nine months of the year, increasing 7% in the first quarter, 11% in the second quarter and 13% in the third quarter. The deteriorating economy had a significant impact on this business in the fourth quarter and sales decreased 4% from the same period in 2007. Acquisitions during the year had a positive 2% impact on Electrical sales in 2008 and, combined with Electricals sales initiatives, partially offset the weakening conditions in the marketplace in the last quarter of the year. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $7.0 billion, $7.7 billion and $7.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 9% decrease in cost of goods sold from 2008 to 2009 is consistent with the sales decrease. Cost of goods sold 16 Table of Contents represented 70.1% of net sales in 2009 and 70.3% of net sales in 2008 and 2007. The relatively constant rate over these three periods reflects how our ongoing gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs were generally offset by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve. In 2009, our Office and Electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases. Industrial was flat and Automotive pricing was down for the year. In 2008 and 2007, all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases. In any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them. Operating Expenses Selling, administrative and other expenses (SGA) decreased by $140 million to $2.2 billion in 2009, representing 22.1% of net sales and up from 21.4% of net sales in 2008. SGA expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from the prior year due primarily to the loss of expense leverage associated with the 9% sales decrease for the year. During 2009, management continued its implementation of extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage. These measures emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems and, for the year, we eliminated approximately $70 million in operating costs. Examples of such savings include costs associated with personnel, freight, fleet and logistics, among others. The Company reduced its workforce by 7% in 2009 (before consideration of acquisitions) and this follows a 5% reduction in employees in 2008. Severance and other termination benefits associated with these employee reductions were insignificant. Our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses and the need for additional cost reductions, while maintaining our high standards for excellent customer service. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was $90 million, up slightly from 2008. The provision for doubtful accounts was $28 million in 2009, up from a $24 million bad debt expense in 2008. Our bad debt expense reflects an increase in uncollectible accounts receivables in 2009 and is likely directly correlated to the ongoing effects of the difficult economic climate, which has pressured certain of our customers. We believe the Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at December 31, 2009. In 2008, SGA was $2.4 billion, or 21.4% of net sales, which was an increase from 2007 when SGA as a percentage of net sales was 21.0%. This increase was mainly due to the loss of leverage on the lower level of sales growth in 2008 relative to the prior year, which offset the benefits of our ongoing cost control initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 was $89 million, relatively consistent with 2007. The provision for doubtful accounts was $24 million in 2008, up from a $14 million bad debt expense in 2007. Total share based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was $8.6 million, $13.0 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding share based compensation. Non Operating Expenses and Income Non operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $28 million in 2009, a decrease from $32 million and $31 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease is the result of an improved interest rate on certain long term debt, effective November 2008. In Other, interest income net of noncontrolling interests increased in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009. In 2008, interest income net of noncontrolling interests decreased from 2007 due to the effects of lower interest rates. Income Before Income Taxes Income before income taxes was $644 million in 2009, a decrease of 16.0% from $768 million in 2008. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 6.4% in 2009, reflecting a decrease from 7.0% in 2008. In 2008, income before income taxes of $768 million was down 5.9% from $817 million in 2007 and as a percentage of net sales was 7.0%, a decrease from 7.5% in 2007. 17 Table of Contents Automotive Group Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 7.4% in 2009 from 7.2% in 2008. The improvement in operating margin for 2009 is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during 2008 and 2009. Automotives initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead. Automotive operating margins decreased to 7.2% in 2008 from 7.8% in 2007. The decline in operating margin for 2008 is attributed to Automotives lower sales volume for the year, partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction measures. Industrial Group Industrial operating margins decreased to 5.6% in 2009 from 8.4% in 2008 and 2007. The decrease in operating margins in 2009 was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. These conditions led to lower levels of sales volume in 2009, which severely impacted our expense leverage, despite our cost reduction efforts. In addition, the decrease in inventory purchases in 2009, a direct result of lower sales, significantly reduced the level of volume incentives earned during the year. These factors more than offset our sales initiatives and cost reduction efforts. We will continue to focus on these areas, however, to show progress in the years ahead. Office Group Operating margins in Office were 7.7% in 2009, down from 8.3% in 2008 and 8.9% in 2007. The prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in 2007 continued to pressure the operating margins at Office in 2009. The decrease in revenues for these three periods has negatively impacted our expense leverage. Our sales strategy remains to capture additional market share, despite the industry slowdown. Electrical Group Operating margins in Electrical decreased to 7.3% in 2009 from 7.9% in 2008. In 2008, the Electrical operating margins had increased to 7.9% from 7.0% in 2007 and marked the fifth consecutive year of operating margin improvement for Electrical. In 2009, the decrease in operating margins was primarily a function of weak market conditions. This factor outweighed the benefits of Electricals sales initiatives and expense savings. Ongoing efforts in these areas, as well as a more stable manufacturing sector, will serve to improve Electricals future operating margins. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate decreased to 38.0% in 2009 from 38.1% in 2008. The decrease from the 2008 rate is mainly due to tax free income in 2009 associated with a Company retirement plan. The 38.1% tax rate in 2008 had increased from 38.0% in 2007. The increase from the prior year rate was mainly due to a non deductible expense associated with a Company retirement plan. Net Income Net income was $400 million in 2009, a decrease of 16% from $475 million in 2008. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.50 in 2009 compared to $2.92 in 2008, down 14%. Net income in 2009 was 4.0% of net sales compared to 4.3% of net sales in 2008. Net income was $475 million in 2008, a decrease of 6% from $506 million in 2007. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $2.92 in 2008 compared to $2.98 in 2007, down 2%. Net income in 2008 was 4.3% of net sales compared to 4.7% of net sales in 2007. 18 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION The following is a discussion of the Companys financial condition at December 31, 2009. Our cash balance of $337 million was up $269 million from December 31, 2008, due primarily to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008. In addition, we were less active in our Company share repurchase program in 2009 when compared to 2008. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2009 decreased by approximately 3% from the prior year and inventory at December 31, 2009 was down by approximately 4% from December 31, 2008. Both of these decreases reflect our decline in sales for the year. Accounts payable increased $85 million or approximately 8% from December 31, 2008, due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by $13 million or 8% from December 31, 2008 and relates primarily to the Companys acquisitions during the year. The change in our December 31, 2009 balances for deferred taxes, down $51 million, as well as pension and other post retirement benefits liabilities, down $202 million, is primarily due to a pension contribution of $53 million and a change in funded status of the Companys pension and other post retirement plans in 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $500 million of long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2009, of which $250 million matures in 2011 and $250 million matures in 2013. The capital and credit markets continue to be volatile and if these conditions continue they are likely to impact our access to these markets. Currently, we believe that our available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Companys operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.9 to 1 at December 31, 2009 compared to 3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2008. Our liquidity position remains solid. The Company had $500 million in total debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company had available a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Sources and Uses of Net Cash A summary of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Change Net Cash Provided by (Used in): 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 (In thousands) Operating Activities $ 845,298 $ 530,309 $ 641,471 59 % (17 )% Investing Activities (264,420 ) (214,334 ) (87,598 ) 23 % 145 % Financing Activities (330,383 ) (472,573 ) (469,496 ) (30 )% 1 % Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: The Company continues to generate cash and 2009 was an especially strong year, with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $845 million in 2009. This represents a 59% increase from 2008, and primarily relates to the $368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, net of the $76 million decrease in net income from 2008. The 17% decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was primarily due to the $116 million net increase in cash used for working capital requirements, including accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, as well as the $31 million decrease in net income from 2007. 19 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Net cash flow used in investing activities was $264 million in 2009 compared to $214 million in 2008, an increase of 23%. Primarily, the increase in investing activities was due to the $73 million used in 2009 for the purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement, net of the $36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008. In 2008, the change in investing activities was primarily due to the $89 million increase in cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2008 and the $56 million decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets during the year, relative to 2007. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: The Company used $330 million of cash in financing activities in 2009, a 30% decrease from the $473 million used in financing activities in 2008. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was relatively consistent with 2007. For the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and the repurchase of the Companys common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $254 million, $252 million and $243 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased $26 million, $273 million and $241 million, respectively, of the Companys common stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually. Notes and Other Borrowings The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .30%. (0.53% at December 31, 2009). At December 31, 2009 and 2008, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. Due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $50 million and $51 million outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding under a $500 million financing arrangement as follows: $250 million, Series B, 6.23% fixed, due 2011; and $250 million senior unsecured note, 4.67% fixed, due 2013. Certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys outstanding borrowings was approximately 5.45% at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $27.1 million, $29.8 million and $21.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Construction and Lease Agreement The Company had an $85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party which expired in 2009. Under the agreement, the third party constructed facilities and leased them to the Company. Upon expiration of the agreement, the Company purchased the properties from the lessor for $73 million, including closing costs, which was paid in July 2009. These properties have been included in property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this arrangement. Contractual and Other Obligations In October 2007, the Company entered into a sale leaseback transaction with a financial institution. In connection with the transaction, the Company sold certain automotive retail store properties and immediately leased the properties back over a lease term of twenty years. The lease was classified as an operating lease. Net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately $56 million. The Company realized a net gain of approximately $20 million, which was deferred and is being amortized over the lease term. 20 Table of Contents The following table shows the Companys approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Contractual Obligations Payment Due by Period Less Than Over Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Credit facilities $ 575,579 $ 27,250 $ 287,627 $ 260,702 $ Capital leases 6,069 1,296 1,934 1,557 1,282 Operating leases 530,608 129,928 175,905 95,565 129,210 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,112,256 $ 158,474 $ 465,466 $ 357,824 $ 130,492 Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $41 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the Companys guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings. The following table shows the Companys approximate commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009: Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total Amounts Less Than Over Committed 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Line of Credit $ $ $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 50,403 50,403 Guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates 200,857 61,622 13,220 13,220 112,795 Total commercial commitments $ 251,260 $ 112,025 $ 13,220 $ 13,220 $ 112,795 In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Contributions in 2009 were $56 million. Contributions required for 2010 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Share Repurchases On August 21, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock, and on November 17, 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares. Such 21 Table of Contents repurchase plans were announced on August 21, 2006 and November 17, 2008, respectively. The authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the Board of Directors. In 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 722,000 shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 17.8 million shares at December 31, 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES General Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Companys inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Methodology The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded provisions for bad debts of $28.5 million, $23.9 million, and $13.5 million, respectively. Consideration Received from Vendors The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs. The Company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and, in the case of advertising allowances, upon completion of the Companys obligations related thereto. While management believes the Company will continue to receive such amounts in 2010 22 Table of Contents and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Companys pension plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Companys management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada and fiduciary standards. The long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rate of return. The Companys investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% SP Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit). We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. Based on the investment policy for the pension plan, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Companys asset allocations and future expectations, the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2010 pension expense or income is 8.00% for the plan. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships. The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the U.S. plans of 6.54% at December 31, 2009. Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $7.3 million, $46.9 million and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decreasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurment which is discussed below, and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans. In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4.3 million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization, which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1, 2010, future retirees will no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre 65 retirees will no longer receive employer provided post 65 benefits (beyond an access only arrangement). 23 Table of Contents QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (In thousands except per share data) 2009 Net Sales $ 2,444,496 $ 2,535,045 $ 2,606,757 $ 2,471,214 Gross Profit 732,201 744,855 765,246 767,460 Net Income 89,159 103,610 107,639 99,167 Earnings Per Share: Basic .56 .65 .67 .62 Diluted .56 .65 .67 .62 2008 Net Sales $ 2,739,473 $ 2,873,485 $ 2,882,115 $ 2,520,190 Gross Profit 819,483 852,213 849,005 751,789 Net Income 123,543 133,073 131,017 87,784 Earnings Per Share: Basic .75 .81 .81 .55 Diluted .75 .81 .81 .55 We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share. The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes certain estimates in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual October 31 book to physical inventory adjustment. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end. The effect of these adjustments in 2009 and 2008 was not significant. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Some statements in this report, as well as in other materials we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or otherwise release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website, constitute forward looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Although the Company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses. Foreign Currency The Company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating units foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. The Companys principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, negatively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009 and 2008, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $104 million and $118 million, respectively.
