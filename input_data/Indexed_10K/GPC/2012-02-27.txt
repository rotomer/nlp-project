MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive parts, industrial parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2011, the Company conducted business throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico from approximately 1,900 locations. We recorded consolidated net sales of $12.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 11% compared to $11.2 billion in 2010. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $565 million, up 19% from $476 million in 2010. The favorable market conditions in the industries that we serve combined with our internal growth initiatives drove the Companys strong performance in 2011. The 11% sales growth in 2011 follows an 11% increase in revenues in 2010 and a 9% decrease in revenues in 2009. Our 19% increase in net income follows a 19% increase and 16% decrease in net income in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Throughout this three year period, the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of its four business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. The recovering economy served to further support the benefits of our internal growth initiatives in 2011 and 2010. In 2009, however, the effects of the economic slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008, adversely impacted the benefit of these initiatives. 15 With regard to the December 31, 2011 consolidated balance sheet, the Companys cash balance of $525 million was consistent with cash of $530 million at December 31, 2010. The Companys strong cash position was supported by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management in 2011. Accounts receivable increased by approximately 7%, relatively in line with our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by less than 2%, including acquisitions. Accounts payable increased $66 million or 5% from the prior year. The Company has increased this line item over the last several years due primarily to the combination of increased purchases, improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other ongoing payables initiatives. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 was unchanged from $500 million at December 31, 2010. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands except per share data) Net Sales $ 12,458,877 $ 11,207,589 $ 10,057,512 Gross Profit 3,606,040 3,252,944 3,009,762 Net Income 565,116 475,511 399,575 Diluted Earnings Per Share 3.58 3.00 2.50 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $12.5 billion, an 11% increase from 2010 driven by sales growth in all four of our business segments for the second consecutive year. The Industrial and Electrical business segments experienced the greatest percentage increases for the year, as the manufacturing sector of the economy held steady and strong in 2011. These businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2011. Sales for the Automotive business segment also continued their positive trend in 2011, primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket. Cumulatively, prices in 2011 were up approximately 3% in the Automotive segment, up approximately 4% in the Industrial segment, up approximately 5% in the Electrical segment and up approximately 2% in the Office segment. Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $11.2 billion, an 11% increase from 2009. All four of our business segments showed sales growth for the year. The Industrial and Electrical business segments had the greatest percentage increases for 2010, as the manufacturing sector of the economy was much stronger in 2010 relative to 2009. These businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2010. Sales for the Automotive business segment were much improved in 2010 as well, primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy. Cumulatively, prices in 2010 were up approximately 1% in the Automotive segment, up approximately 3% in the Industrial segment, up approximately 4% in the Electrical segment and approximately flat in the Office segment. Automotive Group Net sales for the Automotive Group (Automotive) were $6.1 billion in 2011, an increase of 8% from 2010. Sales improved in 2011 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the ongoing solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall aging of the vehicle populations. The positive fundamentals serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items. Automotive revenues were up 9% in the first, second and third quarters, and were up 6% in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency associated with our Canadian and Mexican businesses, which positively impacted sales by approximately 1%. 16 Net sales for Automotive were $5.6 billion in 2010, an increase of 7% from 2009. Sales improved in 2010 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the stronger economy, which drove increased demand for automotive maintenance and supply items. Automotive revenues were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency, which positively impacted sales by approximately 2%. Industrial Group Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (Industrial), were $4.2 billion in 2011, an increase of 19% compared to 2010. Several factors contributed to the sales increase for this group, including the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the continued strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by Industrial. This was evidenced by the reported growth in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices, which this group tends to track. Also in 2011, sales were positively impacted by acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 3% of Industrials sales growth for the year, and the effect of currency associated with our Canadian business, which positively impacted sales by less than 1%. As a result of these several factors, Industrial revenues were up 24% in the first quarter of 2011, up 19% in the second quarter, then up 18% and 13% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. Net sales for Industrial were $3.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 22% compared to 2009. The positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by Industrial contributed to the sales increase for this group. This was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices. Also in 2010, sales were positively impacted by acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 5% of Industrials sales growth for the year. As a result of these several factors, Industrial revenues were up 9% in the first quarter of 2010, up 26% in the second quarter, then up 29% and 24% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. Office Group Net sales for S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group (Office), were $1.7 billion in 2011, up 3% from 2010. Office revenues began to stabilize in 2010 relative to prior year trends, and this group was able to make further progress in 2011. We were pleased to report growth for this business, despite the ongoing difficult environment for the office products industry, which we attribute to the generally slow recovery of white collar employment levels in the U.S. Sales increased approximately 5%, 4% and 3% in the first, second and third quarters, respectively, and were down 1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net sales for Office were $1.6 billion in 2010, up slightly compared to the prior year. Office revenues stabilized in 2010, although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels. Sales decreased approximately 1% in the first and second quarters, were flat in the third quarter and were up by 3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter increase was significant, as the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption had pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of 2010 marked the first positive sales comparison for Office since the second quarter of 2007. Electrical Group Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (Electrical), increased to $558 million in 2011, up 24% from 2010. Our sales initiatives and the continued manufacturing expansion during the year, as measured by the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index, were the primary sales drivers in 2011. In addition, acquisitions in 2011 contributed approximately 11% to Electricals sales growth, and the effect of copper pricing had a 3% positive sales impact for the year. Electrical sales increased by 39% in the first quarter, and this was followed by increases of 28% in the second quarter, 22% in the third quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. Net sales for Electrical increased to $450 million in 2010, up 30% from 2009. Electrical sales increased by 16% in the first quarter, 32% in the second quarter, 31% in the third quarter and 40% in the fourth quarter. The 17 revenue growth in 2010 was driven by our sales initiatives, which were strongly supported by manufacturing expansion during the year, as measured by the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index. In addition, acquisitions in 2010 contributed approximately 9% to Electricals sales growth for the year. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $8.9 billion, $8.0 billion and $7.0 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 11% increase in cost of goods sold from 2010 to 2011 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period. Cost of goods sold represented 71.1% of net sales in 2011, 71.0 % of net sales in 2010 and 70.1% of net sales in 2009. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 2011 and 2010 relative to 2009 reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in Automotive as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in Industrial and Office. These factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs, hence the lower gross margin levels over the last two years. In 2011, all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases for the second consecutive year, although, in 2010, the Automotive and Office increases were relatively immaterial. In 2009, our Office and Electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases, while Industrial was flat and Automotive pricing was down for the year. In any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them. Operating Expenses Selling, administrative and other expenses (SG&A) increased by $228 million or 10% to $2.6 billion in 2011, representing 20.8% of net sales and down from 21.1% of net sales in 2010. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the second consecutive 11% sales increase. In addition, managements ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel, freight, fleet and logistics have served to further improve the Companys cost structure. After reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12% during 2008 and 2009, the Company has only added back approximately 2% of that over the two year period of 2011 and 2010 (including acquisitions). Our management teams remain focused on properly managing the Companys expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was $89 million, relatively in line with 2010. The provision for doubtful accounts was $13 million in 2011, up nearly $3 million or 25% from $11 million in 2010. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily a function of the increase in sales for the year and not due to collections issues. We believe the Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at December 31, 2011. SG&A increased by $147 million or 7% to $2.4 billion in 2010, representing 21.1% of net sales and down from 22.1% of net sales in 2009. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the 11% sales increase for the year. In addition, managements ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel, freight, fleet and logistics have served to further improve the Companys cost structure. After reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12% during 2008 and 2009, the Company added back only 1% of that in 2010 (including acquisitions). In total, of the estimated $70 million cost savings in 2009, the Company estimates that it added back approximately $20 million in costs in 2010, primarily associated with the increase in sales and earnings. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 was $89 million, down slightly from 2009. The provision for doubtful accounts was $11 million in 2010, down 61% from $28 million in 2009. The decrease in bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections environment in 2010 relative to the prior year. Total share based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $7.5 million, $7.0 million, and $8.6 million, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding share based compensation. 18 Non Operating Expenses and Income Non operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $27 million in 2011 and $28 million in 2010 and 2009. The $1 million decrease in interest expense relative to 2010 and 2009 is the result of an improved interest rate on certain long term debt, effective November 2011. In Other, interest income net of noncontrolling interests has increased in each of the last two years due primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009. Income Before Income Taxes Income before income taxes was $891 million in 2011, an increase of 17% from $762 million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 7.1% in 2011, reflecting an increase from 6.8% in 2010. In 2010, income before income taxes of $762 million was up 18% from $644 million in 2009 and as a percentage of net sales was 6.8%, an increase from 6.4% in 2009. Automotive Group Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 7.7% in 2011 from 7.5% in 2010. The improvement in operating margin for 2011 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with Automotives 8% sales increase for the year. Automotives initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead. Automotives operating margin increased to 7.5% in 2010 from 7.4% in 2009. The improvement in operating margin for 2010 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with Automotives 7% sales increase for the year. Industrial Group Industrials operating margin increased to 8.1% in 2011 from 7.3% in 2010. The increase in operating margin in 2011 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 19% sales increase, Industrials second straight year of strong double digit sales growth, the ongoing benefits of recent cost savings and increased volume incentives. Industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead. Industrials operating margin increased to 7.3% in 2010 from 5.6% in 2009. The increase in operating margin in 2010 was due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 22% sales increase, cost savings and increased volume incentives. Office Group Offices operating margin decreased slightly to 7.9% in 2011 from 8.0% in 2010. The decrease in operating margin in 2011 primarily reflects the continued pressures on gross margin in this industry, due to the slower pace of the economic recovery and office employment. These pressures were partially offset by the positive impact of Offices cost savings initiatives. Offices operating margin increased to 8.0% in 2010 from 7.7% in 2009 and reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers. The increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes, which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers. Electrical Group Electricals operating margin increased to 7.3% in 2011 from 6.9% in 2010. The increase in operating margin in 2011 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 24% sales increase, its second straight year of strong double digit sales growth, and the ongoing benefits of effective cost controls. The improvement from these areas was partially offset by the increase in copper prices during the year. Electrical will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead. 19 Electricals operating margin decreased to 6.9% in 2010 from 7.3% in 2009. The decrease in operating margin was mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year, which generally do not affect profit dollars, but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost. The margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in 2010 and greater expense leverage associated with a 30% sales increase. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of 36.6% in 2011 was down from 37.6% in 2010. The decrease from 2010 is primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2011 associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain international taxes. The income tax rate decreased to 37.6% in 2010 from 38.0% in 2009. The decrease from 2009 is attributable to favorable foreign income taxes for the year. Net Income Net income was $565 million in 2011, an increase of 19% from $476 million in 2010. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $3.58 in 2011 compared to $3.00 in 2010, up 19%. Net income in 2011 was 4.5% of net sales compared to 4.2% of net sales in 2010. Net income was $476 million in 2010, an increase of 19% from $400 million in 2009. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $3.00 in 2010 compared to $2.50 in 2009, up 20%. Net income in 2010 was 4.2% of net sales compared to 4.0% of net sales in 2009. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash balance of $525 million at December 31, 2011 was relatively consistent with our cash balance at December 31, 2010, supported by the increase in net income in 2011 and ongoing working capital management. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 increased by approximately 7% from the prior year, which reflects the Companys 7% sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2011. Inventory at December 31, 2011 was up by less than 2% from December 31, 2010, which is well below the Companys increase in sales and primarily attributable to acquisitions. Accounts payable increased $66 million or approximately 5% from December 31, 2010 due primarily to increased inventory purchases related to the Companys sales increase. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by $70 million or 34% from December 31, 2010 due to the Companys acquisitions during the year. The change in our December 31, 2011 balances for deferred taxes, up $94 million or 59%, as well as pension and other post retirement benefits liabilities, up $235 million or approximately 91% from December 31, 2010, is primarily due to a change in funded status of the Companys pension and other post retirement plans in 2011, net of $58 million in pension contributions during the year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $500 million of total debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, of which $250 million matures in November 2013 and $250 million matures in November 2016. In addition, the Company has available a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years, although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets. Currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Companys operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.5 to 1 at December 31, 2011, and this compares to 2.2 to 1 at December 31, 2010. Before consideration of current debt outstanding at December 21, 2010, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 to 1. Our liquidity position remains solid. The Companys $500 million in total debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 is unchanged from 2010. 20 Sources and Uses of Net Cash A summary of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Change Net Cash Provided by (Used in): 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (In thousands) Operating Activities $ 624,927 $678,663 $ 845,298 (8 )% (20 )% Investing Activities (231,497 ) (172,348) (264,420 ) 34 % (35 )% Financing Activities (394,140 ) (320,569) (330,383 ) 23 % (3 )% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: The Company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by operating activities totaled $625 million in 2011. This reflects an 8% decrease from 2010, as, collectively, trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a $19 million use of cash in 2011 compared to a $185 million source of cash in 2010. This was partially offset by a $90 million increase in net income. Net cash provided by operating activities of $679 million in 2010 represents a 20% decrease from 2009, as, collectively, trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable as a source of cash was $129 million less in 2010 relative to 2009 and pension contributions in 2010 increased by $35 million from 2009. These items were partially offset by a $76 million increase in net income. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Net cash flow used in investing activities was $231 million in 2011 compared to $172 million in 2010, an increase of 34%. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2011 were $46 million greater than in 2010, and capital expenditures increased by $18 million. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $172 million in 2010 compared to $264 million in 2009, a decrease of 35%. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2010 was $44 million less than in 2009, while capital expenditures increased by $16 million for the year. The decrease in investing activities was primarily due to a $73 million purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement in 2009. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: The Company used $394 million of cash in financing activities in 2011, a 23% increase from the $321 million used in financing activities in 2010. In 2010, the $321 million of cash used in financing activities was down 3% from the $330 million used in 2009. For the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the Companys common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $276 million, $258 million and $254 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased $122 million, $75 million and $26 million, respectively, of the Companys common stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary. Notes and Other Borrowings The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .30% (0.60% at December 31, 2011). At December 31, 2011 and 2010, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. Due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $54 million and $50 million outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the Company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a $500 million financing arrangement as follows: $250 million series C senior unsecured note, 4.67% fixed, due 2013; and $250 million series D and E senior unsecured notes, 3.35% fixed, due 2016. These borrowings contain covenants 21 related to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys total outstanding borrowings was approximately 4.01% at December 31, 2011 and 5.45% at December 31, 2010. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $24.6 million, $26.6 million and $27.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contractual and Other Obligations The following table shows the Companys approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Contractual Obligations Payment Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over5 Years (In thousands) Credit facilities $ 563,554 $ 20,050 $ 277,452 $ 266,052 $ Operating leases 553,306 134,842 189,028 90,216 139,220 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,116,860 $ 154,892 $ 466,480 $ 356,268 $ 139,220 Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $60 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Companys guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings.

Contributions in 2011 were $58 million. We expect to make a $17 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2012, and contributions required for 2012 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Share Repurchases In 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 13.5 million shares at December 31, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Companys inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Methodology The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of $13.2 million, $10.6 million, and $28.5 million, respectively. 23 Consideration Received from Vendors The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2012 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Companys pension plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Companys management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rate of return. The Companys investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit). We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Companys asset allocations and future expectations, the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2012 pension expense or income is 7.84% for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships. The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 5.17% at December 31, 2011. Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $32.3 million, $21.9 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in pension cost in 2011 from 2010 reflects the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. The increase in pension cost in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2009 and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. The 2009 24 curtailment and subsequent remeasurement decreased benefit costs in 2009 and are discussed further below. Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans. In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4.3 million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a plan reorganization, which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1, 2010, future retirees no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre 65 retirees no longer receive employer provided post 65 benefits (beyond an access only arrangement). QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (In thousands except per share data) 2011 Net Sales $ 2,974,198 $ 3,184,984 $ 3,285,560 $ 3,014,135 Gross Profit 848,794 916,114 948,532 892,600 Net Income 126,515 151,812 151,832 134,957 Earnings Per Share: Basic .80 .97 .97 .87 Diluted .80 .96 .97 .86 2010 Net Sales $ 2,602,115 $ 2,847,186 $ 2,950,560 $ 2,807,728 Gross Profit 760,475 822,310 853,031 817,128 Net Income 100,609 124,467 131,785 118,650 Earnings Per Share: Basic .63 .79 .84 .75 Diluted .63 .78 .83 .75 We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share. The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned, among others. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual September and October book to physical inventory adjustments. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end. The effect of these adjustments in 2011 and 2010 was not significant. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Although the Company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses. 25 Foreign Currency The Company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating units foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. The Companys principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2011 and 2010, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $169 million and $140 million, respectively. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW Genuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive parts, industrial parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials. The Company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2011, the Company conducted business throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico from approximately 1,900 locations. We recorded consolidated net sales of $12.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 11% compared to $11.2 billion in 2010. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $565 million, up 19% from $476 million in 2010. The favorable market conditions in the industries that we serve combined with our internal growth initiatives drove the Companys strong performance in 2011. The 11% sales growth in 2011 follows an 11% increase in revenues in 2010 and a 9% decrease in revenues in 2009. Our 19% increase in net income follows a 19% increase and 16% decrease in net income in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Throughout this three year period, the Company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of its four business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives. The recovering economy served to further support the benefits of our internal growth initiatives in 2011 and 2010. In 2009, however, the effects of the economic slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008, adversely impacted the benefit of these initiatives. 15 With regard to the December 31, 2011 consolidated balance sheet, the Companys cash balance of $525 million was consistent with cash of $530 million at December 31, 2010. The Companys strong cash position was supported by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management in 2011. Accounts receivable increased by approximately 7%, relatively in line with our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by less than 2%, including acquisitions. Accounts payable increased $66 million or 5% from the prior year. The Company has increased this line item over the last several years due primarily to the combination of increased purchases, improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other ongoing payables initiatives. Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 was unchanged from $500 million at December 31, 2010. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands except per share data) Net Sales $ 12,458,877 $ 11,207,589 $ 10,057,512 Gross Profit 3,606,040 3,252,944 3,009,762 Net Income 565,116 475,511 399,575 Diluted Earnings Per Share 3.58 3.00 2.50 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $12.5 billion, an 11% increase from 2010 driven by sales growth in all four of our business segments for the second consecutive year. The Industrial and Electrical business segments experienced the greatest percentage increases for the year, as the manufacturing sector of the economy held steady and strong in 2011. These businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2011. Sales for the Automotive business segment also continued their positive trend in 2011, primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket. Cumulatively, prices in 2011 were up approximately 3% in the Automotive segment, up approximately 4% in the Industrial segment, up approximately 5% in the Electrical segment and up approximately 2% in the Office segment. Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled $11.2 billion, an 11% increase from 2009. All four of our business segments showed sales growth for the year. The Industrial and Electrical business segments had the greatest percentage increases for 2010, as the manufacturing sector of the economy was much stronger in 2010 relative to 2009. These businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2010. Sales for the Automotive business segment were much improved in 2010 as well, primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy. Cumulatively, prices in 2010 were up approximately 1% in the Automotive segment, up approximately 3% in the Industrial segment, up approximately 4% in the Electrical segment and approximately flat in the Office segment. Automotive Group Net sales for the Automotive Group (Automotive) were $6.1 billion in 2011, an increase of 8% from 2010. Sales improved in 2011 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the ongoing solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall aging of the vehicle populations. The positive fundamentals serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items. Automotive revenues were up 9% in the first, second and third quarters, and were up 6% in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency associated with our Canadian and Mexican businesses, which positively impacted sales by approximately 1%. 16 Net sales for Automotive were $5.6 billion in 2010, an increase of 7% from 2009. Sales improved in 2010 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the stronger economy, which drove increased demand for automotive maintenance and supply items. Automotive revenues were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. Other factors impacting our Automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency, which positively impacted sales by approximately 2%. Industrial Group Net sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (Industrial), were $4.2 billion in 2011, an increase of 19% compared to 2010. Several factors contributed to the sales increase for this group, including the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the continued strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by Industrial. This was evidenced by the reported growth in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices, which this group tends to track. Also in 2011, sales were positively impacted by acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 3% of Industrials sales growth for the year, and the effect of currency associated with our Canadian business, which positively impacted sales by less than 1%. As a result of these several factors, Industrial revenues were up 24% in the first quarter of 2011, up 19% in the second quarter, then up 18% and 13% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. Net sales for Industrial were $3.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 22% compared to 2009. The positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by Industrial contributed to the sales increase for this group. This was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices. Also in 2010, sales were positively impacted by acquisitions, which accounted for approximately 5% of Industrials sales growth for the year. As a result of these several factors, Industrial revenues were up 9% in the first quarter of 2010, up 26% in the second quarter, then up 29% and 24% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. Office Group Net sales for S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group (Office), were $1.7 billion in 2011, up 3% from 2010. Office revenues began to stabilize in 2010 relative to prior year trends, and this group was able to make further progress in 2011. We were pleased to report growth for this business, despite the ongoing difficult environment for the office products industry, which we attribute to the generally slow recovery of white collar employment levels in the U.S. Sales increased approximately 5%, 4% and 3% in the first, second and third quarters, respectively, and were down 1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net sales for Office were $1.6 billion in 2010, up slightly compared to the prior year. Office revenues stabilized in 2010, although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels. Sales decreased approximately 1% in the first and second quarters, were flat in the third quarter and were up by 3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter increase was significant, as the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption had pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of 2010 marked the first positive sales comparison for Office since the second quarter of 2007. Electrical Group Net sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (Electrical), increased to $558 million in 2011, up 24% from 2010. Our sales initiatives and the continued manufacturing expansion during the year, as measured by the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index, were the primary sales drivers in 2011. In addition, acquisitions in 2011 contributed approximately 11% to Electricals sales growth, and the effect of copper pricing had a 3% positive sales impact for the year. Electrical sales increased by 39% in the first quarter, and this was followed by increases of 28% in the second quarter, 22% in the third quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. Net sales for Electrical increased to $450 million in 2010, up 30% from 2009. Electrical sales increased by 16% in the first quarter, 32% in the second quarter, 31% in the third quarter and 40% in the fourth quarter. The 17 revenue growth in 2010 was driven by our sales initiatives, which were strongly supported by manufacturing expansion during the year, as measured by the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index. In addition, acquisitions in 2010 contributed approximately 9% to Electricals sales growth for the year. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $8.9 billion, $8.0 billion and $7.0 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 11% increase in cost of goods sold from 2010 to 2011 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period. Cost of goods sold represented 71.1% of net sales in 2011, 71.0 % of net sales in 2010 and 70.1% of net sales in 2009. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 2011 and 2010 relative to 2009 reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in Automotive as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in Industrial and Office. These factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies, promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs, hence the lower gross margin levels over the last two years. In 2011, all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases for the second consecutive year, although, in 2010, the Automotive and Office increases were relatively immaterial. In 2009, our Office and Electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases, while Industrial was flat and Automotive pricing was down for the year. In any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them. Operating Expenses Selling, administrative and other expenses (SG&A) increased by $228 million or 10% to $2.6 billion in 2011, representing 20.8% of net sales and down from 21.1% of net sales in 2010. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the second consecutive 11% sales increase. In addition, managements ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel, freight, fleet and logistics have served to further improve the Companys cost structure. After reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12% during 2008 and 2009, the Company has only added back approximately 2% of that over the two year period of 2011 and 2010 (including acquisitions). Our management teams remain focused on properly managing the Companys expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was $89 million, relatively in line with 2010. The provision for doubtful accounts was $13 million in 2011, up nearly $3 million or 25% from $11 million in 2010. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily a function of the increase in sales for the year and not due to collections issues. We believe the Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at December 31, 2011. SG&A increased by $147 million or 7% to $2.4 billion in 2010, representing 21.1% of net sales and down from 22.1% of net sales in 2009. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the 11% sales increase for the year. In addition, managements ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel, freight, fleet and logistics have served to further improve the Companys cost structure. After reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12% during 2008 and 2009, the Company added back only 1% of that in 2010 (including acquisitions). In total, of the estimated $70 million cost savings in 2009, the Company estimates that it added back approximately $20 million in costs in 2010, primarily associated with the increase in sales and earnings. Depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 was $89 million, down slightly from 2009. The provision for doubtful accounts was $11 million in 2010, down 61% from $28 million in 2009. The decrease in bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections environment in 2010 relative to the prior year. Total share based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $7.5 million, $7.0 million, and $8.6 million, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding share based compensation. 18 Non Operating Expenses and Income Non operating expenses consist primarily of interest. Interest expense was $27 million in 2011 and $28 million in 2010 and 2009. The $1 million decrease in interest expense relative to 2010 and 2009 is the result of an improved interest rate on certain long term debt, effective November 2011. In Other, interest income net of noncontrolling interests has increased in each of the last two years due primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009. Income Before Income Taxes Income before income taxes was $891 million in 2011, an increase of 17% from $762 million in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 7.1% in 2011, reflecting an increase from 6.8% in 2010. In 2010, income before income taxes of $762 million was up 18% from $644 million in 2009 and as a percentage of net sales was 6.8%, an increase from 6.4% in 2009. Automotive Group Automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, increased to 7.7% in 2011 from 7.5% in 2010. The improvement in operating margin for 2011 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with Automotives 8% sales increase for the year. Automotives initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead. Automotives operating margin increased to 7.5% in 2010 from 7.4% in 2009. The improvement in operating margin for 2010 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with Automotives 7% sales increase for the year. Industrial Group Industrials operating margin increased to 8.1% in 2011 from 7.3% in 2010. The increase in operating margin in 2011 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 19% sales increase, Industrials second straight year of strong double digit sales growth, the ongoing benefits of recent cost savings and increased volume incentives. Industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead. Industrials operating margin increased to 7.3% in 2010 from 5.6% in 2009. The increase in operating margin in 2010 was due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 22% sales increase, cost savings and increased volume incentives. Office Group Offices operating margin decreased slightly to 7.9% in 2011 from 8.0% in 2010. The decrease in operating margin in 2011 primarily reflects the continued pressures on gross margin in this industry, due to the slower pace of the economic recovery and office employment. These pressures were partially offset by the positive impact of Offices cost savings initiatives. Offices operating margin increased to 8.0% in 2010 from 7.7% in 2009 and reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers. The increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes, which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers. Electrical Group Electricals operating margin increased to 7.3% in 2011 from 6.9% in 2010. The increase in operating margin in 2011 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 24% sales increase, its second straight year of strong double digit sales growth, and the ongoing benefits of effective cost controls. The improvement from these areas was partially offset by the increase in copper prices during the year. Electrical will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead. 19 Electricals operating margin decreased to 6.9% in 2010 from 7.3% in 2009. The decrease in operating margin was mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year, which generally do not affect profit dollars, but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost. The margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in 2010 and greater expense leverage associated with a 30% sales increase. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate of 36.6% in 2011 was down from 37.6% in 2010. The decrease from 2010 is primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2011 associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain international taxes. The income tax rate decreased to 37.6% in 2010 from 38.0% in 2009. The decrease from 2009 is attributable to favorable foreign income taxes for the year. Net Income Net income was $565 million in 2011, an increase of 19% from $476 million in 2010. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $3.58 in 2011 compared to $3.00 in 2010, up 19%. Net income in 2011 was 4.5% of net sales compared to 4.2% of net sales in 2010. Net income was $476 million in 2010, an increase of 19% from $400 million in 2009. On a per share diluted basis, net income was $3.00 in 2010 compared to $2.50 in 2009, up 20%. Net income in 2010 was 4.2% of net sales compared to 4.0% of net sales in 2009. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our cash balance of $525 million at December 31, 2011 was relatively consistent with our cash balance at December 31, 2010, supported by the increase in net income in 2011 and ongoing working capital management. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 increased by approximately 7% from the prior year, which reflects the Companys 7% sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2011. Inventory at December 31, 2011 was up by less than 2% from December 31, 2010, which is well below the Companys increase in sales and primarily attributable to acquisitions. Accounts payable increased $66 million or approximately 5% from December 31, 2010 due primarily to increased inventory purchases related to the Companys sales increase. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased by $70 million or 34% from December 31, 2010 due to the Companys acquisitions during the year. The change in our December 31, 2011 balances for deferred taxes, up $94 million or 59%, as well as pension and other post retirement benefits liabilities, up $235 million or approximately 91% from December 31, 2010, is primarily due to a change in funded status of the Companys pension and other post retirement plans in 2011, net of $58 million in pension contributions during the year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings. We have $500 million of total debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, of which $250 million matures in November 2013 and $250 million matures in November 2016. In addition, the Company has available a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years, although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets. Currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Companys operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.5 to 1 at December 31, 2011, and this compares to 2.2 to 1 at December 31, 2010. Before consideration of current debt outstanding at December 21, 2010, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 to 1. Our liquidity position remains solid. The Companys $500 million in total debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 is unchanged from 2010. 20 Sources and Uses of Net Cash A summary of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Change Net Cash Provided by (Used in): 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (In thousands) Operating Activities $ 624,927 $678,663 $ 845,298 (8 )% (20 )% Investing Activities (231,497 ) (172,348) (264,420 ) 34 % (35 )% Financing Activities (394,140 ) (320,569) (330,383 ) 23 % (3 )% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: The Company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by operating activities totaled $625 million in 2011. This reflects an 8% decrease from 2010, as, collectively, trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a $19 million use of cash in 2011 compared to a $185 million source of cash in 2010. This was partially offset by a $90 million increase in net income. Net cash provided by operating activities of $679 million in 2010 represents a 20% decrease from 2009, as, collectively, trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable as a source of cash was $129 million less in 2010 relative to 2009 and pension contributions in 2010 increased by $35 million from 2009. These items were partially offset by a $76 million increase in net income. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Net cash flow used in investing activities was $231 million in 2011 compared to $172 million in 2010, an increase of 34%. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2011 were $46 million greater than in 2010, and capital expenditures increased by $18 million. Net cash flow used in investing activities was $172 million in 2010 compared to $264 million in 2009, a decrease of 35%. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2010 was $44 million less than in 2009, while capital expenditures increased by $16 million for the year. The decrease in investing activities was primarily due to a $73 million purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement in 2009. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities: The Company used $394 million of cash in financing activities in 2011, a 23% increase from the $321 million used in financing activities in 2010. In 2010, the $321 million of cash used in financing activities was down 3% from the $330 million used in 2009. For the three years presented, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the Companys common stock. The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $276 million, $258 million and $254 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased $122 million, $75 million and $26 million, respectively, of the Companys common stock. We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary. Notes and Other Borrowings The Company maintains a $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in December 2012 and bears interest at LIBOR plus .30% (0.60% at December 31, 2011). At December 31, 2011 and 2010, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit. Due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $54 million and $50 million outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the Company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a $500 million financing arrangement as follows: $250 million series C senior unsecured note, 4.67% fixed, due 2013; and $250 million series D and E senior unsecured notes, 3.35% fixed, due 2016. These borrowings contain covenants 21 related to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys total outstanding borrowings was approximately 4.01% at December 31, 2011 and 5.45% at December 31, 2010. Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $24.6 million, $26.6 million and $27.1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Contractual and Other Obligations The following table shows the Companys approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Contractual Obligations Payment Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over5 Years (In thousands) Credit facilities $ 563,554 $ 20,050 $ 277,452 $ 266,052 $ Operating leases 553,306 134,842 189,028 90,216 139,220 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,116,860 $ 154,892 $ 466,480 $ 356,268 $ 139,220 Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $60 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates). The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Companys guarantee. To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings. The following table shows the Companys approximate commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Other Commercial Commitments Total AmountsCommitted Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over5 Years (In thousands) Line of credit $ $ $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 53,703 53,703 Guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates 217,166 54,880 135,950 26,336 Total commercial commitments $ 270,869 $ 108,583 $ 135,950 $ 26,336 $ 22 In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Contributions in 2011 were $58 million. We expect to make a $17 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2012, and contributions required for 2012 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Share Repurchases In 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 13.5 million shares at December 31, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories Provisions for Slow Moving and Obsolescence The Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto. Historically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the Companys inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs. While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Methodology The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Initially, the Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience. This initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the Company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable. While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of $13.2 million, $10.6 million, and $28.5 million, respectively. 23 Consideration Received from Vendors The Company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives. Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria. The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year. While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2012 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives. Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators. The Companys judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Employee Benefit Plans The Companys benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Companys pension plan assets. The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Companys management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards. The long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans actuarially assumed long term rate of return. The Companys investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (50% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 10% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, and 30% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit). We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense. We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates. Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Companys asset allocations and future expectations, the Companys expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2012 pension expense or income is 7.84% for the plans. The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Companys benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships. The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date. We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate. Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 5.17% at December 31, 2011. Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was $32.3 million, $21.9 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in pension cost in 2011 from 2010 reflects the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. The increase in pension cost in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2009 and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases. The 2009 24 curtailment and subsequent remeasurement decreased benefit costs in 2009 and are discussed further below. Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans. In April 2009, the Company recorded a $4.3 million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a plan reorganization, which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In July 2009, the Company announced changes to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Effective January 1, 2010, future retirees no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre 65 retirees no longer receive employer provided post 65 benefits (beyond an access only arrangement). QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (In thousands except per share data) 2011 Net Sales $ 2,974,198 $ 3,184,984 $ 3,285,560 $ 3,014,135 Gross Profit 848,794 916,114 948,532 892,600 Net Income 126,515 151,812 151,832 134,957 Earnings Per Share: Basic .80 .97 .97 .87 Diluted .80 .96 .97 .86 2010 Net Sales $ 2,602,115 $ 2,847,186 $ 2,950,560 $ 2,807,728 Gross Profit 760,475 822,310 853,031 817,128 Net Income 100,609 124,467 131,785 118,650 Earnings Per Share: Basic .63 .79 .84 .75 Diluted .63 .78 .83 .75 We recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period. As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share. The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the Company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts, inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned, among others. Bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales, and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels. Inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual September and October book to physical inventory adjustments. The methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end. The effect of these adjustments in 2011 and 2010 was not significant. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Although the Company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses. 25 Foreign Currency The Company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating units foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes. The Companys principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the Canadian dollar, which is the functional currency of our Canadian operations. Foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2011 and 2010, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $169 million and $140 million, respectively.
