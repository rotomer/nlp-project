Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Fiscal 2006 was a challenging year for us. Net sales were $15.9 billion compared with $16.0 billion last year, traffic was weak and comparable store sales decreased by 7 percent compared with a decrease of 5 percent last year. While we saw progress at Banana Republic where customers responded well to our improved product assortments, product acceptance at Gap and Old Navy brands continued to be a challenge. As a result, additional promotions and markdowns drove a 4 percent decrease in gross profit from $5.9 billion in fiscal 2005 to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2006. Piperlime.com was launched successfully in the third quarter and we opened franchised stores in the Middle East and Asia. We invested in marketing and stores in an effort to turnaround our business performance which contributed to a 9 percent increase in operating expenses from $4.1 billion in fiscal 2005 to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2006. Combined, these factors contributed to a 25 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.93 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 compared with $1.24 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006. Despite these disappointing results, we generated free cash flow of $678 million defined as the net cash provided by operating activities less the purchase of property and equipment (for a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP measure, to a GAAP measure, see the Liquidity section in this Managements Discussion and Analysis). We utilized our excess cash to repurchase $1 billion of common stock, and increased our annual dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.32 per share for a total of $265 million. In 2007, we are focusing on three priorities: fixing our core business by creating the right product and store experience, retaining and developing the best talent in the industry, and examining our organization structure to ensure that we enable our brands to make decisions and effect change more efficiently. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of our business and to withstand unanticipated business volatility. Since January 2007, we have taken the following actions: Leadership changes. Our Board of Directors announced a change in the chief executive officer position. Mr. Robert Fisher, our current non employee chairman of the board of directors, stepped in to serve as interim president and chief executive officer. In addition, we announced Marka Hansen, former president of Banana Republic, as the new president of the Gap Brand and Michael Cape, former Vice President, Director of Brand Marketing for J.C. Penney Company, Inc., as the new executive vice president of marketing for the Old Navy brand. Conversion of Old Navys Outlet stores into Old Navy stores. In order to drive improved returns and leverage its existing retail channel, we made the decision in February 2007 to convert 45 Old Navy Outlet stores into Old Navy stores. We expect the conversion to be completed by October 2007. Closure of distribution facility. As part of our on going assessment of network capacity, we made the decision in February 2007 to close a distribution facility in Hebron, Kentucky. The expenses associated with converting the Old Navy Outlet stores and closing the distribution center are expected to be approximately $6 million in fiscal 2007. Closure of Forth & Towne. After a thorough analysis revealed that the concept was not demonstrating enough potential to deliver acceptable long term return on investment, we announced in February 2007 that we would close our Forth & Towne stores. We plan to close all 19 stores by the end of June 2007 and expect the pre tax expenses associated with the closure to be approximately $40 million. 17 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Net Sales by Brand, Region and Channel Net sales consist of retail sales, online sales and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. Outlet retail sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. Fiscal 2006 had 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net sales numbers for the quarter and year include this additional week; however, comparable stores sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Net sales for the 53rd week of fiscal 2006 were $200 million. Net sales by brand, region and channel are as follows: 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (3) Total Net Sales ($ in millions) North America (1) Stores $ 4,873 $ 6,484 $ 2,370 $ 20 $ 13,747 Direct (Online) 261 345 117 7 730 Europe Stores 792 792 Asia Stores 581 61 642 Other Regions (2) 32 32 Total $ 6,507 $ 6,829 $ 2,548 $ 59 $ 15,943 Global Sales Growth (Decline) (5 )% 11 % 103 % 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (3) Total Net Sales ($ in millions) North America (1) Stores $ 5,176 $ 6,588 $ 2,196 $ 5 $ 13,965 Direct (Online) 233 268 91 3 595 Europe Stores 825 825 Asia Stores 603 14 617 Other Regions (2) 21 21 Total $ 6,837 $ 6,856 $ 2,301 $ 29 $ 16,023 Global Sales Growth (Decline) (6 )% 2 % 1 % (2 )% 52 Weeks Ended January 29, 2005 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (3) Total Net Sales ($ in millions) North America (1) Stores $ 5,510 $ 6,511 $ 2,178 $ $ 14,199 Direct (Online) 236 236 91 563 Europe Stores 879 879 Asia Stores 591 591 Other Regions (2) 24 11 35 Total $ 7,240 $ 6,747 $ 2,269 $ 11 $ 16,267 Global Sales Growth (Decline) (1 )% 5 % 9 % 3 % (1) North America includes the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp store sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. A store is considered non comparable (Non comp) when, in general, the store has no comparable prior year sales. For example, a store that has been open for less than one year, a store that has changed its square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year, or a store that has been permanently repositioned within the past year is considered Non comp. Non store sales such as online revenues are also considered Non comp. A store is considered Closed if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year then the store will be in Non comp status for the same days in the following year. The difference between prior year net sales can be classified as follows: 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007 Increase (decrease) ($ in millions) Gap (2) Old Navy BananaRepublic (2) Other (3) Total 2005 Net Sales $ 6,837 $ 6,856 $ 2,301 $ 29 $ 16,023 Comparable store sales (475 ) (518 ) 5 (988 ) Non comparable store sales 97 388 212 26 723 Direct (Online) 28 77 26 4 135 Foreign exchange (1) 20 26 4 50 2006 Net Sales $ 6,507 $ 6,829 $ 2,548 $ 59 $ 15,943 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2006 Increase (decrease) ($ in millions) Gap (2) Old Navy BananaRepublic (2) Other (3) Total 2004 Net Sales $ 7,240 $ 6,747 $ 2,269 $ 11 $ 16,267 Comparable store sales (302 ) (361 ) (104 ) (767 ) Non comparable store sales (87 ) 409 130 15 467 Direct (Online) (3 ) 32 3 32 Foreign exchange (1) (11 ) 29 6 24 2005 Net Sales $ 6,837 $ 6,856 $ 2,301 $ 29 $ 16,023 (1) Foreign exchange is the translation impact of current year exchange rates versus current year sales at prior year exchange rates. (2) Includes International stores. (3) Other includes Forth & Towne beginning August 2005, franchise business beginning September 2006, Piperlime.com beginning October 2006, and Business Direct which ended in July 2006. Our fiscal 2006 sales decreased $80 million compared with fiscal 2005. Our fiscal 2006 comparable store sales declined 7 percent compared with the prior year primarily due to our product assortments at the Gap and Old Navy brands which did not perform to our expectations. Our total non comparable store sales increase was 19 Table of Contents due to the 194 store openings in 2006. Overall, our net square footage increased 3 percent over the prior year and sales productivity in fiscal 2006 was $395 per average square foot compared with $412 per average square foot in fiscal 2005. We closed 116 stores in fiscal 2006. Our fiscal 2005 sales decreased $244 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, our comparable store sales declined 5 percent compared with the prior year primarily due to our product assortments which did not perform to our expectations. Our total non comparable store sales increase was due to the 198 new store openings. Our overall net square footage increased 3 percent over the prior year. Sales productivity in fiscal 2005 was $412 per average square foot compared with $428 per average square foot in fiscal 2004. We closed 139 stores in fiscal 2005, mainly for Gap brand. Comparable store sales percentage by brand for fiscal 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Gap North America reported negative 7 percent in 2006 versus negative 5 percent in 2005; Old Navy North America reported negative 8 percent in 2006 versus negative 6 percent in 2005; Banana Republic North America reported flat in 2006 versus negative 5 percent in 2005; and International reported negative 8 percent in 2006 versus negative 3 percent in 2005. Store Count and Square Footage Store count and square footage were as follows: February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 Number of Store Locations Square Footage (in millions) Number ofStore Locations Square Footage (in millions) Gap North America 1,293 12.3 1,335 12.6 Gap Europe 168 1.5 165 1.5 Gap Asia 105 1.0 91 1.0 Old Navy North America 1,012 19.3 959 18.4 Banana Republic North America 521 4.5 494 4.2 Banana Republic Japan 13 0.1 4 Forth & Towne 19 0.2 5 0.1 Total 3,131 38.9 3,053 37.8 Increase over Prior Year 3 % 3 % 2 % 3 % Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the cost of merchandise, inventory shortage and valuation adjustments, freight charges, costs associated with our sourcing operations, production costs, insurance costs related to merchandise and occupancy, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, and depreciation for our stores and distribution centers.

Our merchandise margin, calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold, decreased 1.3 percentage points, or $248 million, as product acceptance challenges drove additional promotions and markdowns. As a percentage of sales, occupancy expenses increased compared with fiscal 2005 primarily due to the decrease in sales for stores that have been open for more than one year. This was offset by a net decrease in occupancy expenses of $31 million related to the fiscal 2005 amortization of key money paid to acquire the rights of tenancy in France ($50 million) net of a lease accounting adjustment to true up amounts which were estimated in our fiscal 2004 financial statements ($19 million). Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 2.6 percentage points in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Our merchandise margin decreased 2.2 percentage points, or $475 million, as product acceptance challenges drove additional promotions and markdowns. In addition, cost of goods sold increased due to a reclassification of certain sourcing costs from operating expenses to cost of goods sold. While we had been classifying the majority of sourcing expenses in cost of goods sold, certain sourcing expenses had been classified in operating expenses and, as a result, approximately $42 million of year to date sourcing expenses, primarily comprised of payroll and benefit expenses for our wholly owned agent offices, were reclassified during fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, occupancy expenses increased compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to the decrease in sales for stores that had been open for more than one year. In addition, occupancy expenses increased due to $50 million recognized in fiscal 2005 related to the amortization of key money paid to acquire the rights of tenancy in France. Prior to fiscal 2005, we considered key money an indefinite life intangible asset that was not amortized and, in fiscal 2005, we determined that key money should more appropriately be amortized over the corresponding lease term and recorded $50 million of amortization expense representing the cumulative impact of amortizing our key money balance from fiscal 1995 through the end of fiscal 2005. The increase was offset by a $19 million decrease in occupancy expenses from a lease accounting adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to true up amounts which were estimated in our fiscal 2004 financial statements. As a general business practice, we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear the majority of this merchandise. Operating Expenses, Excluding Loss on Early Retirement of Debt Operating expenses include payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions), advertising, and general and administrative expenses. Also included are costs to design and develop our products, merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers and stores, distribution center general and administrative expenses, and rent, occupancy, and depreciation for headquarter facilities.

Our operating expenses were higher than last year because of $91 million in increased marketing and store related activities, $169 million in increased payroll and related expenses for more employees and merit, $32 million in increased share based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123(R), Share Based Payment, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, $61 million as a result of the effect of the sublease loss reserve reversal in fiscal 2005, $29 million in 21 Table of Contents increased impairment of long lived assets offset by $31 million in income relating to the change in our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift cards in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 0.7 percentage points, or $172 million, in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by a $61 million net reversal of sublease loss reserve in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and the reclassification of certain sourcing expenses. While we have been classifying the majority of sourcing expenses in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses, some operating costs related to certain wholly owned agent offices that source our product had been classified in operating expenses. As a result, approximately $42 million of year to date sourcing expenses were reclassified in fiscal 2005. This reclassification had no effect on net earnings. Lower advertising expenses primarily driven by our decision not to run a holiday television campaign at Gap brand and lower bonus expense related to fiscal 2005 performance also contributed to the decrease in operating expenses. Operating margin excluding loss on early retirement of debt, was 7.4 percent, 10.9 percent, and 12.8 percent in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For fiscal 2007, we expect operating margin to be in the high single digits. Included in operating expenses are costs related to store closures and sublease loss reserves. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the second fiscal quarter of 2005, we completed our assessment of available space and future office facility needs and decided that we would occupy one of our vacant leased properties in San Francisco. As a result the sublease loss reserve of $58 million associated with this space was reversed in the second fiscal quarter of 2005 and we occupied the space in fiscal 2006. We further reduced the reserve by $3 million based on our decision to occupy certain additional office space. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt Percentage of Net Sales ($ in millions) 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 29,2005 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 29,2005 Loss on Early Retirement of Debt $ $ $ 105 0.6 % In fiscal 2004, we performed a net present value analysis on our outstanding debt and because it was beneficial we repurchased our convertible notes early. Accordingly, we recognized $105 million in loss on early retirement of debt in fiscal 2004 due to premiums paid and write off of issuance costs. Interest Expense Percentage of Net Sales ($ in millions) 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 29,2005 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 29,2005 Interest Expense $ 41 $ 45 $ 167 0.3 % 0.3 % 1.0 % The decreases of $4 million and $122 million in interest expense for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively, were primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of our March 2005 redemption of the convertible notes. 22 Table of Contents We anticipate that fiscal 2007 interest expense will be about $35 million.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 was primarily driven by the impact of a favorable tax settlement related to the U.S. Japan Income Tax Treaty. We currently expect the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent due to the more pronounced impact of our Japan business, which is subjected to a higher tax rate than that of the U.S. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations, the overall level of earnings, and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: ($ in millions) February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 January 29, 2005 Working capital (a) $ 2,757 $ 3,297 $ 4,062 Current ratio (a) 2.21:1 2.70:1 2.81:1 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,250 $ 1,551 $ 1,597 (a) Our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash. Working capital and current ratio as of February 3, 2007 decreased compared with January 28, 2006 due primarily to lower short term investments and the reclassification of the current portion of our long term debt to current liabilities, offset by higher inventory as a result of an increase in stores and square footage. Our short term investments decreased as a result of our share repurchases and capital expenditures, offset by cash from operating activities. 23 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash include personnel related expenses, merchandise inventory purchases, payment of taxes, and occupancy expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $301 million compared with fiscal 2005, primarily due to the decrease in net earnings, higher prepaid taxes and higher inventory levels, offset by an increase in accrued expenses. For fiscal 2005, the $46 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared with fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable mainly as a result of lower merchandise inventory levels, and the decrease in accrued expenses, driven primarily by the decreased bonus payout as a result of fiscal 2005 performance. These decreases were offset by an increase in cash provided by the decreased inventory balance as a result of disciplined inventory management. Inventory management remains an area of focus. We continue to execute against our strategies to optimize inventory productivity and more tightly manage the receipt and timing of our inventory, while maintaining appropriate in store merchandise levels and product assortment to support sales growth. Inventory per square foot at February 3, 2007 was $44, a 2 percent increase over fiscal 2005 primarily due to the change in shortage trends resulting in a lower shortage estimate. Inventory per square foot at January 28, 2006 was $43, an 11 percent decrease over fiscal 2004 primarily due to earlier Spring and later Summer product flow in fiscal 2004. We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking over a total of about 13 weeks during the Back to School and Holiday periods. During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, these periods accounted for 31 percent, 32 percent, and 32 percent, respectively, of our annual net sales. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods. We expect the percent increase in inventory per square foot at the end of both the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007 to be flat compared with last year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash outflows are primarily for purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short term investments. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2006 was $150 million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $286 million in fiscal 2005. This $436 million decrease was driven by the release of $959 million of restricted cash in fiscal 2005 as a result of the amendment to our letter of credit agreement, partially offset by $504 million more cash provided by net maturities of investments in fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2005, net cash provided by investing activities increased $103 million compared with fiscal 2004, as our release of restricted cash increased $622 million, offset by $382 million less cash provided by net maturities of investments and $181 million more in capital expenditures. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, capital expenditures totaled approximately $572 million and $600 million, respectively. The majority of these expenditures in both fiscal years were used for new store locations, store remodels and information technology. For fiscal 2007, we expect capital expenditures to be about $700 million. We expect to open about 230 new store locations and to close about 200 store locations. Included in both the expected store openings and closings are 45 Old Navy Outlet stores that will be converted to Old Navy stores. As a result, we expect net square footage to increase about 1 percent for fiscal 2007. 24 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash outflows related to financing activities consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock, while cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share based compensation. For fiscal 2006, cash flows used for financing activities decreased $938 million compared with fiscal 2005, driven by us repurchasing approximately $1.0 billion less common stock than last year. For fiscal 2005, cash flows used for financing activities increased $244 million compared with fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased $2.0 billion of common stock and received $139 million of proceeds from share based compensation. In fiscal 2004, we repurchased $1.0 billion of common stock and received $154 million of proceeds from share based compensation. In addition, we made $871 million of payments for long term debt in fiscal 2004. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric, as it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to keep the business growing. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to increase free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure. ($ in millions) 53 Weeks EndedFebruary 3, 2007 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 2006 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 29, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,250 $ 1,551 $ 1,597 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (572 ) (600 ) (419 ) Free cash flow $ 678 $ 951 $ 1,178 The following table sets forth our reconciliation of projected fiscal 2007 free cash flow: ($ in millions) Projected 52 Weeks EndingFebruary 2, 2008 Projected net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,200 Less: Projected purchase of property and equipment (700 ) Projected fiscal 2007 free cash flow $ 500 In fiscal 2006, we delivered $678 million in free cash flow, which represented 87% of net earnings. Our earnings continue to generate strong free cash flow. Free cash flow as a percent of net earnings was 85% and 102% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the year ended February 3, 2007, our free cash flow decreased $273 million compared with the prior year primarily due to lower earnings in fiscal 2006. We are committed to maintaining sufficient liquidity to support the needs of our business and withstand unanticipated business volatility and plan to keep about $1.5 billion of cash and investments available. We will continue to evaluate our $1.5 billion target over time to reflect the changing needs of our business. Dividend Policy In determining whether to, and at what level to, declare a dividend, we considered a number of financial factors, including sustainability and financial flexibility, as well as other factors including operating performance 25 Table of Contents and capital resources. While we intend to increase dividends over time at a rate greater than our growth in net income, we will balance future increases with the corresponding cash requirements. During fiscal 2006, we increased our annual dividends, which had been $0.18 per share for fiscal 2005 to $0.32 per share for fiscal 2006. The increase in annual dividends reflects the declaration and payment of our fiscal 2006 dividends at the increased rate of $0.08 per share per quarter. We intend to maintain our annual dividend of $0.32 for fiscal 2007. Stock Repurchase Program Since the beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company has repurchased 205 million shares for approximately $4 billion. During fiscal 2006, we announced share repurchase authorizations totaling $1.25 billion through August 1, 2007. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately 58 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.0 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $17.97. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately 99 million shares for $2.0 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $20.29. Debt and Credit Facility The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2006, the remaining balance of our 6.90 percent notes payable of $325 million, due September 2007, was classified into current maturities of long term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the remaining balance of our 8.80 percent note payable of $138 million, due December 2008 (2008 Notes) is subject to an increasing or decreasing rate of interest based on certain credit rating fluctuations. As a result of prior and current fiscal year changes to our long term credit ratings, the interest payable by us on the 2008 Notes was 9.80 percent per annum as of February 3, 2007. Subsequent to year end, our credit rating was further downgraded which will increase the interest payable by us to 10.05 percent per annum, effective on June 15, 2007. Our access to the capital markets and interest expense on future financings is dependent on our senior unsecured debt rating. However, we do not expect this downgrade to have a material impact on our financial statements. On May 6, 2005, we entered into four separate $125 million 3 year letter of credit agreements and four separate $100 million 364 day letter of credit agreements for a total aggregate availability of $900 million, which collectively replaced our prior letter of credit agreements. Unlike the previous letter of credit agreements, the current letter of credit agreements are unsecured. Consequently, the $900 million of restricted cash that collateralized the prior letter of credit agreements was fully released in May 2005. As of May 5, 2006, the four $100 million 364 day letter of credit agreements expired and the total letter of credit capacity was reduced to $500 million. This reduction in the letter of credit capacity reflects our transition to open account payment terms as well as the available capacity under our $750 million revolving credit facility to issue trade letters of credit. On March 11, 2005, we called for the full redemption of our outstanding $1.4 billion, 5.75 percent senior convertible notes due March 15, 2009 (the 2009 Notes). The redemption was complete by March 31, 2005. Note holders had the option to receive cash at a redemption price equal to 102.46 percent of the principal amount of the 2009 Notes, plus accrued interest, for a total of approximately $1,027 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2009 Notes. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their 2009 Notes into approximately 62.03 shares of The Gap, Inc. common stock per $1,000 principal amount. As of March 31, 2005, $1.4 billion of principal was converted into 85 million shares of The Gap, Inc. common stock and approximately $0.5 million was paid in cash redemption. 26 Table of Contents On August 30, 2004, we terminated all commitments under our $750 million three year secured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in June 2006 (the Old Facility) and replaced the Old Facility with a new $750 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2009 (the New Facility). The New Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop, working capital, trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the New Facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. The New Facility and letter of credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the New Facility and new letter of credit agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the New Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the New Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements. In addition, such a default could, under certain circumstance, permit the holders of our outstanding unsecured debt to accelerate payment of such obligations. Letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. As of February 3, 2007, we had $190 million in trade letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreements totaling $500 million and there were no borrowings under our $750 million revolving credit facility. In line with our fiscal 2004 objective of reducing long term debt, we repaid $871 million in debt in fiscal 2004. This included early extinguishment of $596 million of our domestic debt and the maturity of 227 million 5 year Euro bond ($275 million). We repurchased and extinguished early an aggregate of $180 million in principal amount of our notes due 2005, $91 million in principal amount of our notes due 2007 and $325 million in principal amount of our notes due 2008. We performed a net present value analysis on our outstanding debt and determined that it would be beneficial to repurchase the debt early even though we incurred $105 million in loss on early retirement of debt due to premiums paid and write off of debt issuance costs. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of February 3, 2007. These obligations impact our short and long term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while others are disclosed as future obligations. ($ in millions) Less than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Amounts reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets: Debt (a) $ 325 $ 188 $ $ $ 513 Accrued interest on debt (b) 11 11 Other cash obligations not reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets: Operating leases (c) 1,066 1,888 1,245 1,504 5,703 Purchase obligations and commitments (d) 2,501 437 209 296 3,443 Interest (e) 31 16 47 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,934 $ 2,529 $ 1,454 $ 1,800 $ 9,717 27 Table of Contents (a) Represents principal maturities, net of unamortized discount, excluding interest. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our debt. (c) Payments for maintenance, insurance, taxes, and percentage rent to which we are obligated are excluded. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases. (d) Represents estimated open purchase orders and commitments to purchase inventory and other goods and services in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements. (e) Represents interest expected to be paid on our debt and does not assume early debt repurchases, which would reduce the interest payments projected above. We have other commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees outstanding at February 3, 2007 of $49 million (of which $41 million was issued under the revolving credit facility lines), $54 million and $3 million, respectively. Amounts Reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets We have other long term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, including deferred income taxes. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal 2007 that are included in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) entered in fiscal 2005 as described in Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the services agreement, IBM will operate certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure that are currently operated by us. The services agreement has an initial term of ten years, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we will pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. Based on the currently projected service needs, we expect to pay approximately $1 billion to IBM over the remaining nine years of the contract. The services agreement has performance levels that IBM must meet or exceed. If these service levels are not met, we would in certain circumstances receive a credit against the charges otherwise due, have the right to other interim remedies, or as to material breaches have the right to terminate the services agreement. In addition, the agreement provides us certain pricing protections, and we have the right to terminate the services agreement both for cause and for convenience (subject, in the case of termination for convenience, to our payment of a termination fee). IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. We have applied the measurement and disclosure provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of the Indebtedness of Others, to our agreements that contain guarantee and certain indemnification clauses. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee. As of February 3, 2007, we did not have any material guarantees that were issued or modified subsequent to December 31, 2002. 28 Table of Contents We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these contracts we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $58 million, of which $5 million has already been cash collateralized. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Merchandise Inventory In fiscal 2005, we implemented a new inventory system and effective January 29, 2006 (the beginning of fiscal 2006), we changed our inventory flow assumption from the first in, first out (FIFO) method to the weighted average cost method (WAC). The change in inventory accounting method did not have a material impact on the fiscal 2006 financial statements and because the effect on prior periods presented is not material, they have not been restated as would be required by SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market and record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. The change in shortage expense as a percentage of cost of goods sold was a decrease of 0.7 percentage points, an increase of 0.6 percentage points and a decrease of 0.2 percentage points for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Excess Facilities We have a significant investment in property and equipment. In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include decisions to close a store, headquarter facility or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset. For assets that are identified as potentially being impaired, if the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using the discounted future cash flows of the assets based upon a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital. Our estimate of future cash flows is based upon our experience, knowledge and third party data. However, these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability, real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We recorded a charge for the impairment of long lived assets of $32 million, $3 million, and $5 million during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decision to close or sublease a store, distribution center or headquarter facility space can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised remaining useful life of the long lived asset. In addition, we record a charge and corresponding sublease loss reserve for the net present value of the difference between the contract rent obligations and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties. We estimate the reserve based on the status of our efforts to lease vacant office space and stores, including a review of real estate market conditions, our projections for sublease income and sublease commencement assumptions. Most store closures occur upon the lease expiration. Insurance and Self insurance We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts, and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold (including shipping costs) at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements as amended by SAB 104, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized for store sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register with either cash or credit card. For online sales, we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product. Customers typically receive goods within a few days of shipment. Such amounts were immaterial as of February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are reflected in net sales and the related costs are reflected in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses. Allowances for estimated returns are recorded based on estimated gross profit using our historical return patterns. 30 Table of Contents Upon the purchase of a gift card or issuance of a gift certificate, a liability is established for the cash value of the gift card or gift certificate. The liability is relieved and income is recorded as net sales upon redemption. Over time, some portion of the gift cards issued is not redeemed. This amount is recorded as other income, which is a component of operating expenses. Beginning with the second quarter of 2006, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift cards to three years from our prior estimate of five years. During the second quarter of 2006, we completed an analysis of our historical gift card redemption patterns. Based on this analysis, we concluded that three years after the gift card is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, this change in estimate resulted in income recognition of approximately $31 million before tax in other income. Share Based Compensation With the adoption of the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)) at the beginning of our first fiscal quarter of 2006, we added Share Based Compensation as a critical accounting policy and estimate. We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires assumptions requiring a high degree of judgment. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we proactively reviewed our stock option granting practices over the 10 year period ended June 2006, given the heightened scrutiny regarding this topic. We concluded that the compensation expense recorded in our historical financial statements was materially correct. Specifically, we identified no backdating in connection with the grants of stock options to Vice Presidents and above. We found some errors relating to the dating of stock option grants to certain lower level employees as well as some calculation errors. We finalized our review and recorded $4.5 million of additional compensation expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 related to historical stock option accounting. Income Taxes We record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of audit by various taxing authorities. To the extent that our estimates of probable settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. We also record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings, changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial position, statement of cash flows and results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge substantially all forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations using foreign exchange forward contracts. We also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany loans and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding or issuing the intercompany loan or balance. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions, thereby minimizing the credit exposure from our counter parties. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2006 were the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, based on a model that measures the change in fair values of our derivative financial instruments arising from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant. The analysis covers all foreign exchange derivative financial instruments offset by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an unfavorable impact on the fair values of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of the underlying exposures, of $20 million at February 3, 2007 and $30 million at January 28, 2006. We hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument is reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on the investments. In addition, we used a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of $50 million debt securities of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK, from a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent, payable in U.S. dollars, to 6.1 billion Japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of 2.43 percent. These debt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their issuance amount, net of unamortized discount. The derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value as of February 3, 2007. We have limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. The interest on our long term debt is set at a fixed coupon, with the exception of the interest rates payable by us on our outstanding $500 million notes due December 2008, of which only $138 million remains outstanding, which are subject to change based on our long term senior secured credit ratings. The interest rates earned on our cash and equivalents will fluctuate in line with short term interest rates. In March 2002, we issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent senior convertible notes due March 15, 2009 (the 2009 Notes), and received proceeds of $1.4 billion in cash, net of underwriting and other fees. On March 11, 2005, we called for the full redemption of the 2009 Notes. The redemption was complete by March 31, 2005. Note holders had the option to receive cash at a redemption price equal to 102.46 percent of the principal amount of the 2009 Notes, plus accrued interest, for a total of approximately $1,027 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2009 Notes. Alternatively, note holders could elect to convert their 2009 Notes into approximately 62.03 shares of The Gap, Inc. common stock per $1,000 principal amount. As of March 31, 2005, $1.4 billion of principal was converted into 85 million shares of The Gap, Inc. common stock and approximately $0.5 million was paid in cash redemption. In November 2001, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities at an original annual interest rate of 8.80 percent, due December 15, 2008 (2008 Notes). Interest on the notes is payable 32 Table of Contents semi annually, The note payable is subject to an increasing or decreasing rate of interest based on certain credit rating fluctuations. We repurchased $325 million of the 2008 Notes during fiscal 2004 and $38 million in fiscal 2003. As a result of prior and current fiscal year changes to our long term credit ratings, the interest payable by us on the 2008 Notes was 9.80 percent per annum as of February 3, 2007. Subsequent to year end, our credit rating was further downgraded which will increase the interest payable by us to 10.05 percent per annum, effective on June 15, 2007. Our access to the capital markets and interest expense on future financings is dependent on our senior unsecured debt rating. However, we do not expect this downgrade to have a material impact on our financial statements. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 1997, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities, due September 15, 2007 (the 2007 Notes), with a fixed interest rate of 6.90 percent. Interest on the 2007 Notes is payable semi annually. We repurchased $91 million of the 2007 Notes during fiscal 2004 and $83 million in fiscal 2003. The 2007 Notes are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their issuance amount net of repurchases and unamortized discount. A summary of our long term debt and senior convertible notes is as follows: February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 ($ in millions) Carrying Amount inU.S. Dollars Fair Value (a) Carrying Amount inU.S. Dollars Fair Value (a) $500 million notes payable, 6.90%, interest due semi annually, due September 2007 $ $ $ 325 $ 329 $500 million notes payable, 8.80% (9.80%), interest due semi annually, due December 2008 (b) 138 147 138 153 $50 million notes payable, 6.25%, interest due semi annually, due March 2009 50 50 50 51 Total long term debt $ 188 $ 197 $ 513 $ 533 (a) Based on the face amount multiplied by the market price of the note as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. (b) The interest rate payable on these notes is subject to increase (decrease) by 0.25 percent for each rating downgrade (upgrade) by the rating agencies. The rate in parentheses reflects the rate at February 3, 2007. In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate on the note. 33 Table of Contents
