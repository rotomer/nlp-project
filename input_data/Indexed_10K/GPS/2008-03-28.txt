Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW We are a global specialty retailer operating retail and online stores selling casual apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Piperlime brands. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate stores that sell apparel, purchased from us, under our brand names. In addition, our U.S. customers can shop online at www.gap.com, www.bananarepublic.com, www.oldnavy.com, and www.piperlime.com. We design virtually all of our products, which are manufactured by independent sources, and sell them under our brands. We also offer products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties in our online shoe store, Piperlime, which was launched in October 2006. Fiscal 2007 and 2005 had 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2006. Net sales numbers for the fourth quarter and year for fiscal 2006 include this additional week; however, comparable store sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Significant financial items during fiscal 2007 include: Net sales for fiscal 2007 were $15.8 billion compared with $15.9 billion in fiscal 2006, and comparable store sales decreased 4 percent compared with a decrease of 7 percent last year. Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 increased 7 percent to $867 million, or $1.09 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $809 million, or $0.97 per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2006. In February 2007, we announced our decision to close our Forth & Towne store locations. We eliminated about 550 Forth & Towne positions and closed all 19 stores by the end of June 2007. Forth & Towne is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We recorded a loss from the discontinued operation of $34 million, net of income tax benefit, in fiscal 2007 and we expect future charges to be immaterial. As part of our efforts to streamline operations, we examined our organizational structure to ensure that we were enabling our brands to make decisions and effect change more efficiently. These cost reduction initiatives resulted in $34 million of expenses in fiscal 2007, of which $32 million were operating expenses and $2 million were cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses. The majority of these expenses were related to severance benefits for employees at our headquarter locations. Net earnings for fiscal 2007 were $833 million, or $1.05 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $778 million, or $0.93 per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2006. Included in net earnings for fiscal 2007 was $68 million, or $0.07 per share on a diluted basis, related to the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne and expenses associated with our cost reduction initiatives described above. Our online sales for fiscal 2007 increased 24 percent to $903 million, compared with $730 million for fiscal 2006. We generated cash flows from operating activities of $2.1 billion during 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we paid $326 million related to the maturity of our 6.90 percent notes payable. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 were $682 million. In fiscal 2007, we generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion compared with free cash flow of $678 million in fiscal 2006. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less the purchase of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure, see the Financial Condition section in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. Gap Inc. Form 10 K 17 Table of Contents We repurchased about 89 million shares of our common stock for a total of $1.7 billion under our share repurchase programs in fiscal 2007 which underscores our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2007, we focused on three critical areas to restore the health of the Company: simplifying the business and holding each brand accountable to its priorities, managing our inventory with discipline to enable growth in gross margin and gross profit, and focusing on product and target customers, specifically at Gap and Old Navy. This work helped us increase net earnings and has created the important groundwork for our future. In fiscal 2008, we will focus on four priorities: driving earnings through inventory discipline which supports improved gross margin, continuing cost management, improving return on invested capital, and continuing to focus on product across all brands. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In February 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for our share repurchase program and a plan to increase the annual dividend per share by six percent, from $0.32 per share in fiscal 2007 to $0.34 per share in fiscal 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Net Sales by Brand, Region and Channel Net sales consist of retail sales, online sales and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. Outlet retail sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. Fiscal 2007 and 2005 had 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2006. Net sales numbers for the fourth quarter and year for fiscal 2006 include this additional week; however, comparable stores sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Net sales for the additional week in fiscal 2006 were approximately $200 million. Net sales by brand, region and channel are as follows: (in millions) 52 Weeks Ended February 2, 2008 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (2) Total U.S. (1) Stores $ 4,146 $ 5,776 $ 2,351 $ $ 12,273 Direct (Online) 308 428 136 31 903 Canada 364 461 147 972 Europe 822 5 827 Asia 613 89 36 738 Other (2) 50 50 Total $ 6,253 $ 6,665 $ 2,723 $ 122 $ 15,763 Global Sales Growth (Decline) (4 )% (2 )% 7 % 213 % (1 )% 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (2) Total U.S. (1) Stores $ 4,494 $ 6,042 $ 2,251 $ $ 12,787 Direct (Online) 261 345 117 7 730 Canada 379 442 119 940 Europe 792 1 793 Asia 581 61 7 649 Other (2) 24 24 Total $ 6,507 $ 6,829 $ 2,548 $ 39 $ 15,923 Global Sales Growth (Decline) (5 )% 11 % 56 % (1 )% 18 Gap Inc.

Comparable Store Sales A store is included in comparable store sales (Comp) when it has been open at least one fiscal year and the square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp store sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. A store is considered non comparable (Non comp) when it has been open for less than one fiscal year or it has changed its square footage by 15 percent or more within the past fiscal year. Non store sales such as online revenues are also considered Non comp. A store is considered Closed if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year then the store will be in Non comp status for the same days in the following year. The difference between prior year and current year net sales can be classified as follows: ($ in millions) 52 Weeks Ended February 2, 2008 Gap (3)(4) Old Navy (3) BananaRepublic (3)(4) Other (5) Total 2006 Net Sales $ 6,507 $ 6,829 $ 2,548 $ 39 $ 15,923 Increase (decrease) in: Comparable stores (252 ) (410 ) 23 (639 ) Non comparable and closed stores (1) (112 ) 127 86 59 160 Direct (Online) 47 83 19 24 173 Foreign exchange (2) 63 36 47 146 2007 Net Sales $ 6,253 $ 6,665 $ 2,723 $ 122 $ 15,763 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2007 Gap (3)(4) Old Navy (3) BananaRepublic (3)(4) Other (5) Total 2005 Net Sales $ 6,837 $ 6,856 $ 2,301 $ 25 $ 16,019 Increase (decrease) in: Comparable stores (475 ) (518 ) 5 (988 ) Non comparable and closed stores (1) 95 387 211 10 703 Direct (Online) 28 77 26 4 135 Foreign exchange (2) 22 27 5 54 2006 Net Sales $ 6,507 $ 6,829 $ 2,548 $ 39 $ 15,923 Gap Inc.

Our fiscal 2007 net sales decreased $160 million, or 1 percent compared with fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks, and the additional week contributed approximately $200 million of net sales. Our fiscal 2007 comparable store sales declined 4 percent compared with the prior year. The 3 percentage point difference between net sales and comparable store sales was primarily due to the impact of new stores and a 24 percent increase in online sales for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Overall, our net square footage increased 1.8 percent in fiscal 2007 from the prior year and sales productivity was $376 per average square foot for fiscal 2007 compared with $395 per average square foot in fiscal 2006. We opened 214 new stores and closed 178 stores in fiscal 2007. This includes the conversion of 45 Old Navy Outlet stores to Old Navy, which are reflected in both openings and closings, and the closure of 19 Forth & Towne stores. Our fiscal 2006 sales decreased $96 million, or 0.6 percent, compared with fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, our comparable store sales declined 7 percent compared with the prior year primarily due to our product assortments at the Gap and Old Navy brands which did not perform to our expectations. Our total non comparable store sales increase was due to the 194 new store openings and the additional week of sales in fiscal 2006. Our overall net square footage increased 2.9 percent over the prior year and sales productivity in fiscal 2006 was $395 per average square foot compared with $412 per average square foot in fiscal 2005. We closed 116 stores in fiscal 2006, mainly for Gap brand. Comparable store sales percentage by brand for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as follows: Gap North America: negative 5 percent in fiscal 2007 versus negative 7 percent in fiscal 2006; Old Navy North America: negative 7 percent in fiscal 2007 versus negative 8 percent in fiscal 2006; Banana Republic North America: positive 1 percent in fiscal 2007 versus flat in fiscal 2006; and International: negative 1 percent in fiscal 2007 versus negative 8 percent in fiscal 2006.

Form 10 K Table of Contents Outlet stores are reflected in each of the respective brands. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Bahrain, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Philippines, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Croatia. We had 68 and 7 franchise stores that were open as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include: the cost of merchandise; inventory shortage and valuation adjustments; freight charges; costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits; production costs; insurance costs related to merchandise; and occupancy, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, and depreciation for our stores and distribution centers. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points, or $307 million, in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The decrease was driven primarily by an increase in selling at regular price and a higher margin achieved for marked down merchandise. As a percentage of sales, occupancy expenses increased 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased 1.3 percentage points, or $156 million, in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, as product acceptance challenges drove additional promotions and markdowns. As a percentage of sales, occupancy expenses decreased 0.1 percentage points compared with fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in occupancy expenses of $31 million related to the fiscal 2005 amortization of key money paid to acquire the rights of tenancy in France ($50 million) net of a lease accounting adjustment to true up amounts which were estimated in our fiscal 2004 financial statements ($19 million). As a general business practice, we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear the majority of this merchandise. Gap Inc. Form 10 K 21 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses include: payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions); advertising; general and administrative expenses; costs to design and develop our products; merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers and stores; distribution center general and administrative expenses; rent, occupancy, and depreciation for headquarter facilities; and other expense (income). The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were flat, but decreased $55 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to the following: $97 million in decreased marketing expenses, primarily for Gap and Old Navy; offset by $32 million of expenses, the majority of which were severance payments, recognized in fiscal 2007 as a result of our cost reduction initiatives not included in fiscal 2006; $31 million of income recognized in fiscal 2006 related to the change in our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift cards not included in fiscal 2007; and $14 million of income recognized in fiscal 2006 related to the Visa/Mastercard litigation settlement. The remaining decrease is due to lower payroll and other expenses across the organization. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 2.2 percentage points, or $333 million, in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to: $162 million in increased payroll and related expenses for more employees and merit increases; $84 million in increased marketing and store related activities; $61 million of income recognized in fiscal 2005 as a result of the effect of the sublease loss reserve reversal not included fiscal 2006; $32 million in increased share based compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123(R), Share Based Payment, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006; $26 million in increased impairment of long lived assets; offset by 22 Gap Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents $31 million of income in fiscal 2006 relating to the change in our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift cards; and $14 million of income recognized in fiscal 2006 related to the Visa/Mastercard litigation settlement. Operating margin was 8.3 percent, 7.7 percent, and 11.1 percent in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. For fiscal 2008, we expect operating margin to be approximately 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent. Interest Expense Percentage of Net Sales ($ in millions) 52 WeeksEndedFebruary 2,2008 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedFebruary 2,2008 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 Interest Expense $ 26 $ 41 $ 45 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.3 % The decrease of $15 million in interest expense for fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006, was primarily due to the maturity of our $326 million, 6.90 percent notes repaid in September 2007 and reduction of interest accruals resulting from the resolutions of tax audits and outstanding tax contingencies completed in fiscal 2007. The decrease of $4 million in interest expense for fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005, was primarily due to lower debt levels as a result of our March 2005 redemption of convertible notes. We anticipate that fiscal 2008 interest expense will be about $20 million. Interest Income Percentage of Net Sales ($ in millions) 52 WeeksEndedFebruary 2,2008 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedFebruary 2,2008 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 Interest Income $ 117 $ 131 $ 93 0.7 % 0.8 % 0.6 % Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006, is due to lower average balances of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as well as a lower interest rate environment. Income Taxes Percentage of Net Sales ($ in millions) 52 WeeksEndedFebruary 2,2008 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 52 WeeksEndedFebruary 2,2008 53 WeeksEndedFebruary 3,2007 52 WeeksEndedJanuary 28,2006 Income Taxes $ 539 $ 506 $ 692 3.4 % 3.2 % 4.3 % Effective Tax Rate 38.3 % 38.5 % 38.0 % The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was primarily driven by the impact of changes in state tax laws. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by the absence of the favorable tax settlement realized in 2005 related to the U.S. Japan Income Tax Treaty. Gap Inc. Form 10 K 23 Table of Contents We currently expect the fiscal 2008 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations, the overall level of earnings, and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies. Discontinued Operation Loss from discontinued operation relates to the Forth & Towne brand, whose stores were closed by the end of June 2007. Loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne, net of income tax benefit, was $34 million, $31 million, and $18 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Loss from the discontinued operation on a pre tax basis for fiscal 2007 included $29 million related to the impairment of long lived assets, $6 million of lease settlement charges, $5 million of employee severance, $2 million of net sublease losses and $4 million of administrative and other costs. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources for the last three fiscal years: ($ in millions) 52 WeeksEnded/As ofFebruary 2, 2008 53 WeeksEnded/As ofFebruary 3, 2007 52 WeeksEnded/As ofJanuary 28, 2006 Working capital (a) $ 1,653 $ 2,757 $ 3,297 Current ratio (a) 1.68:1 2.21:1 2.70:1 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,081 $ 1,250 $ 1,551 (a) Our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash. Our working capital and current ratio as of February 2, 2008 decreased compared with February 3, 2007 due primarily to decreases in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and merchandise inventory, and an increase in accounts payable. We believe that cash flows from our operations and our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, personnel related expenses, and payment of taxes and occupancy. In fiscal 2007, net cash provided by operating activities increased $831 million compared with fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher net earnings, a decrease in inventory purchases as a result of our continued focus on inventory management, an increase in accounts payable due to a change in vendor payment terms and lower income taxes paid in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2006, the $301 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared with fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings, higher prepaid taxes and higher inventory levels, offset by an increase in accrued expenses. Inventory management remains an area of focus. We continue to execute against our strategies of managing inventory levels in a manner that supports more selling at regular price and healthy merchandise margins. As a result, inventory per square foot at February 2, 2008 was $37, compared with inventory per square foot of $44 at February 3, 2007 and $43 at January 28, 2006. We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking over a total of about thirteen weeks during the 24 Gap Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents back to school and holiday periods. During fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, these periods accounted for 32 percent, 31 percent, and 32 percent, respectively, of our annual net sales. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods. As part of our normal business practices, we periodically benchmark vendor payment terms within our industry. Based upon this review, we determined that there was an opportunity to modify our merchandise vendor payment terms to be more in line with our competitors. This change became effective in September 2007 and, as a result, we have an extended time to pay. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short term investments. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2007 increased $124 million compared with fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007 and 2006, capital expenditures totaled $682 million and $572 million, respectively. The majority of these expenditures in both fiscal years were used for new store locations, store remodels and information technology. In fiscal 2007, we had net maturities of short term investments of $393 million compared with net maturities of short term investments of $381 million in fiscal 2006. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2006 was $150 million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $286 million in fiscal 2005. This $436 million decrease was driven by the release of $959 million of restricted cash in fiscal 2005 as a result of the amendment to our letter of credit agreement, partially offset by $504 million more cash provided by net maturities of investments in fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2008, we expect capital expenditures to be about $500 million. We expect to open about 115 new store locations and to close about 100 store locations. These openings and closings include 15 store repositions. As a result, we expect net square footage to increase less than half a percent for fiscal 2008. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash outflows related to financing activities consist primarily of the repurchase of our common stock, repayment of debt, and dividend payments, while cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share based compensation. During fiscal 2007, we paid $1.7 billion for the repurchase of approximately 89 million shares compared with repurchases of approximately 58 million shares for $1.1 billion in fiscal 2006. We also repaid our 6.90 percent notes payable of $326 million in September 2007. For fiscal 2006, cash flows used for financing activities decreased $938 million compared with fiscal 2005 driven by repurchases of $1.0 billion less common stock than in fiscal 2005. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. In fiscal 2007, we delivered $1.4 billion in free cash flow, which represented 168 percent of net earnings, compared with $678 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was driven primarily by lower inventory levels and the change in vendor payment terms. Free cash flow as a percent of net earnings was 87 percent and 85 percent for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gap Inc. Form 10 K 25 Table of Contents The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure.

We intend to consider an increase in dividends when we deliver growth in net earnings. A dividend of $0.08 per share was declared and paid in each quarter of fiscal 2007 and 2006, for an annual dividend of $0.32 per share. In 2005, a dividend of $0.045 per share was declared and paid in each quarter of fiscal 2005, for an annual dividend of $0.18. We intend to increase our annual dividend per share from $0.32 for fiscal 2007 to $0.34 for fiscal 2008. Share Repurchase Program Since the beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company has repurchased approximately 294 million shares for $5.7 billion. In August 2007, the Board of Directors authorized $1.5 billion of our share repurchase program which was fully utilized in fiscal 2007. In connection with this $1.5 billion share repurchase program, we entered into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family whose ownership represented approximately 17 percent of the Companys outstanding shares at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The shares were purchased each month at the same weighted average market price that we paid for share repurchases in the open market. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 89 million shares for $1.7 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $19.05. Approximately 13 million shares were repurchased for $249 million from the Fisher family. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately 58 million shares for $1.1 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $17.97. In February 2008, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program, and that the Company has entered into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family whose ownership represents approximately 16 percent of our outstanding shares. The Company expects that about $158 million (approximately 16 percent) of the $1 billion share repurchase program will be purchased from these Fisher family members. 26 Gap Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Debt The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2007, we paid $326 million related to the maturity of our 6.90 percent notes payable. The remaining balance of our 8.80 percent notes payable of $138 million, due December 2008 (2008 Notes) was reclassified into current maturities of long term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2008. The interest rate payable on the 2008 Notes is subject to an increasing or decreasing rate of interest based on certain credit rating fluctuations. As a result of changes to our long term senior unsecured credit ratings in prior periods, the interest rate on the 2008 Notes was 10.05 percent per annum as of February 2, 2008. Our access to the capital markets and interest expense on future financings is dependent on our senior unsecured debt rating. Our long term debt as of February 2, 2008 consists of $50 million notes payable due March 2009 with a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent per annum. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the cross currency interest rate swaps used in connection with this debt. Credit Facilities The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. As of February 2, 2008, our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate $125 million, three year, unsecured letter of credit agreements for a total aggregate availability of $250 million and a scheduled termination date of May 2010. As of February 2, 2008, we had $91 million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements. We also have a $500 million, five year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2012 (the New Facility). The New Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop, working capital, trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the New Facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the facility, interest would be a base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the revolving credit facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of February 2, 2008, there were no borrowings under the New Facility. The New Facility and letter of credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the New Facility and letter of credit agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the New Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the New Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements. In addition, such a default could, under certain circumstance, permit the holders of our outstanding unsecured debt to accelerate payment of such obligations. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of February 2, Gap Inc. Form 10 K 27 Table of Contents 2008. These obligations impact our short term and long term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while others are disclosed as future obligations. ($ in millions) Less than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Total Amounts reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets: Debt (a) $ 138 $ 50 $ $ $ 188 Accrued interest on debt (b) 5 5 Liabilities for uncertain tax positions (c) 3 3 Other cash obligations not reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets: Operating leases (d) 1,098 1,859 1,091 1,430 5,478 Purchase obligations and commitments (e) 2,427 400 214 209 3,250 Interest (f) 16 1 17 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,687 $ 2,310 $ 1,305 $ 1,639 $ 8,941 (a) Represents principal maturities, net of unamortized discount, excluding interest.

(c) The table above excludes $120 million of long term liabilities under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments of the long term liabilities for uncertain tax positions will occur. The amount is included in lease incentives and other long term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2008. (d) Maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations are excluded. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases. (e) Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business. (f) Represents interest expected to be paid on our debt and does not assume early debt repurchases, which would reduce the interest payments projected above. We have other commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of $55 million (of which $49 million was issued under the revolving credit facility lines), surety bonds of $52 million and bank guarantees of $4 million outstanding at February 2, 2008. Amounts Reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets We have other long term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, including deferred income taxes. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal 2008 that are included in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Gap Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) entered in fiscal 2005 as described in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the services agreement, IBM operates certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure that had previously been operated by us. The services agreement has an initial term of ten years, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we will pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $874 million to IBM over the remaining eight years of the contract. The services agreement has performance levels that IBM must meet or exceed. If these service levels are not met, we would in certain circumstances receive a credit against the charges otherwise due, have the right to other interim remedies, or as to material breaches have the right to terminate the services agreement. In addition, the agreement provides us certain pricing protections, and we have the right to terminate the services agreement both for cause and for convenience (subject, in the case of termination for convenience, to our payment of a termination fee). IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of February 2, 2008. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation. We account for these guarantees in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of the Indebtedness of Others. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $48 million as of February 2, 2008. The fair value of the guarantees was not material as of February 2, 2008. We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements and various other agreements. Under these contracts we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $43 million, of which $2 million has already been cash collateralized. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gap Inc. Form 10 K 29 Table of Contents Our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10 K. Merchandise Inventory We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market and record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our markdown reserve calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown or inventory shortage reserves. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Excess Facilities We have a significant investment in property and equipment. In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review the carrying value of long lived assets, including lease rights and key money, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, headquarter facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset. For assets that are identified as potentially being impaired, if the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using the discounted future cash flows of the assets based upon a rate commensurate with the risk. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and costs and useful lives of the assets. Estimating the fair value further requires selecting the discount rate and other factors affecting the valuation of asset fair values, and is based upon our experience, knowledge and third party data. However, these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability, real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. The decision to close or sublease a store, headquarter facility, or distribution center can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised remaining useful life of the long lived asset. In addition, we record a charge and corresponding sublease loss reserve for the net present value of the difference between the contractual rent obligations and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties. We estimate the reserve based on the status of our efforts to lease vacant office space and stores, including a review of real estate market conditions, our projections for sublease income and sublease commencement assumptions. Most store closures occur upon the lease expiration. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses or the sublease loss reserve. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 30 Gap Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Insurance and Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts, and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Revenue Recognition While revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy for the Company. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash or credit card. For online sales, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on estimated gross profit using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. Unredeemed Gift Cards Upon the purchase of a gift card or issuance of a gift certificate, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of the gift cards issued is not redeemed. This amount is recorded as other income, which is a component of operating expenses, when it can be determined that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions. We determine the probability of the gift card being redeemed to be remote based on historical gift card redemption patterns. Historically, actual redemption patterns have not been materially different from our estimates. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment. For stock options, we use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires assumptions requiring a high degree of judgment. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield. For stock options and other stock awards, we also estimate the forfeiture rate which is the number of stock awards that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Income Taxes On February 4, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before Gap Inc. Form 10 K 31 Table of Contents being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. We also record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings, changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial position, statement of cash flows and results of operations. 32 Gap Inc. Form 10 K Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations and forecasted royalty payments using foreign exchange forward contracts. We also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany loans and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding or issuing the intercompany loan or balance. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions, which are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2007 were the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollar. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also use forward contracts to hedge the net assets of an international subsidiary to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investment in that subsidiary. The change in fair value of the forward contracts is reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on the investment. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. dollar (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $37 million at February 2, 2008 and $20 million at February 3, 2007. We have limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. We use a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of $50 million debt securities of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK, due March 2009, from a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent, payable in U.S. dollars, to 6.1 billion Japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of 2.43 percent. These debt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their issuance amount, net of unamortized discount. The fair value of this long term debt was $51 million and $50 million as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. The interest on our $500 million notes payable due December 2008, of which only $138 million remains outstanding, is subject to increase (decrease) by 0.25 percent for each rating downgrade (upgrade) of our long term senior unsecured debt ratings by rating agencies. The interest payable by us on the notes was 10.05 percent per annum as of February 2, 2008. The fair value of the notes payable as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 was $144 million and $147 million, respectively. In addition, we have fixed and variable income investments classified as cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Primarily all securities held are U.S. government and agency securities, domestic commercial paper, and bank securities and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair market value due to the short maturities of these instruments. An increase in interest rates of 10 percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments. However, declines in interest rates would decrease the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $117 million, $131 million, and $93 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Gap Inc. Form 10 K 33 Table of Contents
