Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are a global specialty retailer offering clothing, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate stores that sell apparel, purchased from us, under our brand names. In addition, our U.S. customers can shop online at www.gap.com, www.oldnavy.com, www.bananarepublic.com, www.piperlime.com, and www.athleta.com. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties. In September 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Athleta, Inc. (Athleta), a womens sports and active apparel company based in Petaluma, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $148 million. The acquisition will allow us to enhance our presence in the growing womens active apparel sector in the United States. We believe this acquisition complements our brands and allows us to leverage our online platform to expand into this significant retail sector. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 had 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2006. Net sales numbers for the fourth quarter and year for fiscal 2006 include this additional week; however, comparable store sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Financial highlights include: Net sales for fiscal 2008 were $14.5 billion compared with $15.8 billion for fiscal 2007, and comparable store sales decreased 12 percent compared with a decrease of 4 percent last year. Net earnings for fiscal 2008 increased 16 percent to $967 million, or $1.34 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $833 million, or $1.05 per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2007. Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 increased 12 percent to $967 million, or $1.34 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $867 million, or $1.09 per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2007. Our Direct sales for fiscal 2008 increased 14 percent to $1.0 billion, compared with $903 million for fiscal 2007. Our Direct segment includes our online business and, beginning in September 2008 with the acquisition of Athleta, our catalog business. We generated cash flows from operating activities of $1.4 billion during fiscal 2008. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 were $431 million. In fiscal 2008, we generated free cash flow of $981 million compared with free cash flow of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2007. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. We repurchased approximately 46 million shares of our common stock for a total of $745 million under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2008. We also declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.34 per share in fiscal 2008. We opened 101 new stores and closed 119 stores in fiscal 2008. 18 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Macroeconomic conditions deteriorated in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and continued in the fourth quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were down 13 percent from the prior year comparable period. Despite this, our cash flow generation remains healthy and we have a strong balance sheet. As of January 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.8 billion and long term debt of $50 million, classified as current, was repaid in March 2009. We believe our cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for the foreseeable future. During this challenging economic environment we are focused on the following priorities: consistently delivering product that aligns with our target customers; improving customer experience and continuing to invest in the store fleet in a manner that supports improvement in return on invested capital; managing inventory to support a healthy merchandise margin; maintaining a focus on cost management; and generating strong free cash flow. Results of Operations Net Sales Net Sales by Brand, Region, and Reportable Segment Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. Outlet retail sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. Fiscal years ended January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2008) and February 2, 2008 (fiscal 2007) had 52 weeks. Fiscal year ended February 3, 2007 (fiscal 2006) had 53 weeks. Net sales numbers for the fourth quarter and year for fiscal 2006 include this additional week; however, comparable store sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Net sales for the additional week in fiscal 2006 were approximately $200 million. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. 19 Table of Contents Net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment are as follows: ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2008 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (3) Total U.S. (1) $ 3,840 $ 4,840 $ 2,221 $ $ 10,901 Canada 329 392 146 867 Europe 724 23 33 780 Asia 732 101 47 880 Other Regions 68 68 Total Stores reportable segment 5,625 5,232 2,491 148 13,496 Direct reportable segment (2) 333 475 145 77 1,030 Total $ 5,958 $ 5,707 $ 2,636 $ 225 $ 14,526 Sales Growth (Decline) (5 )% (14 )% (3 )% 84 % (8 )% Fiscal Year 2007 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (3) Total U.S. (1) $ 4,146 $ 5,776 $ 2,351 $ $ 12,273 Canada 364 461 147 972 Europe 822 5 827 Asia 613 89 36 738 Other Regions 50 50 Total Stores reportable segment 5,945 6,237 2,587 91 14,860 Direct reportable segment (2) 308 428 136 31 903 Total $ 6,253 $ 6,665 $ 2,723 $ 122 $ 15,763 Sales Growth (Decline) (4 )% (2 )% 7 % 213 % (1 )% Fiscal Year 2006 Gap Old Navy BananaRepublic Other (3) Total U.S. (1) $ 4,494 $ 6,042 $ 2,251 $ $ 12,787 Canada 379 442 119 940 Europe 792 1 793 Asia 581 61 7 649 Other Regions 24 24 Total Stores reportable segment 6,246 6,484 2,431 32 15,193 Direct reportable segment (2) 261 345 117 7 730 Total $ 6,507 $ 6,829 $ 2,548 $ 39 $ 15,923 Sales Growth (Decline) (5 )% 11 % 56 % (1 )% (1) U.S. includes the United States and Puerto Rico.

Comparable Store Sales The percentage change in comparable store sales by brand and region and for total Company for fiscal 2008 and 2007 are as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 Gap North America (8 )% (5 )% Old Navy North America (17 )% (7 )% Banana Republic North America (10 )% 1 % International (4 )% (1 )% The Gap, Inc. (12 )% (4 )% 20 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents The comparable store sales calculation excludes sales from our Direct reportable segment and our wholesale and franchise businesses. Outlet comparable store sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. A store is included in comparable store sales (Comp) when it has been open for at least 12 months and the square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp store sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. A store is considered non comparable (Non comp) when it has been open for less than 12 months or it has changed its square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. Non store sales such as online and catalog revenues are also considered Non comp. A store is considered Closed if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year then the store will be in Non comp status for the same days in the following year. Store Count and Square Footage Information Net sales per average square foot is as follows: Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Net sales per average square foot (1) $ 336 $ 376 $ 395 (1) Excludes net sales associated with the Direct segment and our wholesale and franchise businesses. Computation also excludes net sales and average square footage associated with the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne.

We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. There were 121 and 68 franchise stores that were open as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. Net Sales Discussion Our fiscal 2008 net sales decreased $1.2 billion, or 8 percent, compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $1.4 billion related to our Stores reportable segment offset by an increase in net sales of $127 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our fiscal 2008 net sales decreased $1.4 billion, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in net sales at all of our brands due to the weakening retail environment and declines in traffic, offset by an increase in net sales from our franchise business, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $19 million. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if fiscal 2007 sales were translated at fiscal 2008 exchange rates. For the Direct reportable segment, our fiscal 2008 net sales increased $127 million, or 14 percent, compared with fiscal 2007 due to the growth in our online business across all brands and the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008. Our fiscal 2007 net sales decreased $160 million, or 1 percent, compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $333 million related to our Stores reportable segment offset by an increase in net sales of $173 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our fiscal 2007 net sales decreased $333 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in net sales at Old Navy and Gap, offset by an increase in net sales at Banana Republic, our franchise business, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $146 million. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if fiscal 2006 sales were translated at fiscal 2007 exchange rates. Note that fiscal 2006 consisted of 53 weeks and the additional week contributed approximately $200 million of net sales. For the Direct reportable segment, our fiscal 2007 net sales increased $173 million, or 24 percent, compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to the growth in our online business across all brands. Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include: the cost of merchandise; inventory shortage and valuation adjustments; freight charges; costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits; production costs; insurance costs related to merchandise; and rent, occupancy, depreciation, amortization, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and utilities related to store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions. 22 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses $ 9,079 $ 10,071 $ 10,266 Gross Profit $ 5,447 $ 5,692 $ 5,657 Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses as a Percentage of Net Sales 62.5 % 63.9 % 64.5 % Gross Margin 37.5 % 36.1 % 35.5 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold decreased $1.1 billion, or 3.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses increased $60 million, or 1.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. For the Stores reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold decreased 3.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease was driven by higher margins achieved for both regular price and marked down merchandise primarily as a result of reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts. Occupancy expenses increased 1.9 percentage points as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily driven by lower net sales in fiscal 2008 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in certain occupancy expenses. For the Direct reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily driven by higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications. Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold decreased $307 million, or 1.4 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Occupancy expenses increased $112 million, or 0.8 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. For the Stores reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 0.4 percentage points in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold decreased 1.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in selling at regular price and a higher margin achieved for marked down merchandise. Occupancy expenses increased 1.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. For the Direct reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold decreased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily driven by the write off of discontinued merchandise in fiscal 2006 that did not occur in fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, decreased 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily driven by higher net sales. As a general business practice, we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear the majority of this merchandise. 23 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses include: payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions); advertising; general and administrative expenses; costs to design and develop our products; merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers and stores; distribution center general and administrative expenses; rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization for corporate facilities; and other expense (income). The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Operating Expenses $ 3,899 $ 4,377 $ 4,432 Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Net Sales 26.8 % 27.8 % 27.8 % Operating Margin 10.7 % 8.3 % 7.7 % Operating expenses decreased $478 million, or 1.0 percent as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: $195 million in decreased corporate and divisional overhead expenses, primarily related to bonus, payroll, and employee benefits; $141 million in decreased store payroll and benefits; $88 million in decreased store related expenses associated with fewer remodels, fewer fixture rollouts, and less packaging and supplies; and $41 million in decreased marketing expenses, primarily for Gap and Old Navy. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were flat, but decreased $55 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to the following: $97 million in decreased marketing expenses, primarily for Gap and Old Navy; offset by $32 million of expenses, the majority of which were severance payments, recognized in fiscal 2007 as a result of our cost reduction initiatives not included in fiscal 2006; $31 million of income recognized in fiscal 2006 related to the change in our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift cards not included in fiscal 2007; and $14 million of income recognized in fiscal 2006 related to the Visa/Mastercard litigation settlement. 24 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents The remaining decrease is due to lower payroll and other expenses across the organization. Interest Expense Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Interest Expense $ 1 $ 26 $ 41 The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the maturity of our $326 million, 6.90 percent notes repaid in September 2007 and the reduction of interest accruals resulting primarily from foreign tax audits occurring in fiscal 2008. The decrease of $15 million in interest expense for fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006, was primarily due to the maturity of our $326 million, 6.90 percent notes repaid in September 2007 and the reduction of interest accruals resulting from the resolutions of tax audits and outstanding tax contingencies completed in fiscal 2007. Interest Income Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Interest Income $ 37 $ 117 $ 131 Interest income is earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. The decreases in interest income for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 were primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. Income Taxes Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Income Taxes $ 617 $ 539 $ 506 Effective Tax Rate 39.0 % 38.3 % 38.5 % The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by the impact of changes in 2007 in state tax laws and a change in the mix of earnings, with a higher relative percentage of fiscal 2008 earnings occurring in jurisdictions that impose the highest relative tax rates. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was primarily driven by the impact of changes in state tax laws. We currently expect the fiscal 2009 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations, the overall level of earnings, and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies. Loss from Discontinued Operation, Net of Income Tax Benefit Loss from discontinued operation relates to the Forth & Towne brand, whose stores were closed by the end of June 2007. Loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne, net of income tax benefit, was $34 million and $31 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 25 Table of Contents We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources: ($ in millions) January 31,2009 February 2,2008 February 3,2007 Cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash $ 1,756 $ 1,939 $ 2,644 Debt $ 50 $ 188 $ 513 Working capital (a) $ 1,847 $ 1,653 $ 2,757 Current ratio (a) 1.86:1 1.68:1 2.21:1 (a) Our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash. Our working capital and current ratio as of January 31, 2009 increased compared with February 2, 2008 primarily due to decreases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. See Cash Flows from Operating Activities below. As of January 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.8 billion and long term debt of $50 million, classified as current, was repaid in March 2009. Our cash flow generation remains healthy and our cash position remains strong. We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be adequate to support our business operations, capital expenditures, and the payment of dividends. We are also able to supplement the near term liquidity, if necessary, with the existing $500 million revolving credit facility. Cash Flows from Operating Activities In fiscal 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $669 million compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: an increased balance in accounts payable in fiscal 2007 due to the change in vendor payment terms; a higher payout during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 related to the fiscal 2007 bonus compared with the prior year comparable period; a decrease in the gift card, gift certificate, and voucher liability due to more redemptions than issuances in fiscal 2008, compared with more issuances than redemptions in fiscal 2007; decreases in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities related to information technology projects and advertising expenses; offset by higher net earnings in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2007, net cash provided by operating activities increased $831 million compared with fiscal 2006, primarily due to the following: higher net earnings in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006; a decrease in inventory purchases as a result of our continued focus on inventory management; an increase in accounts payable due to a change in vendor payment terms; and lower income taxes paid in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Inventory management remains an area of focus. We continue to execute against our strategy of managing inventory levels in a manner that supports healthy merchandise margins. As a result, inventory per square foot at January 31, 2009 was $34.7 compared with inventory per square foot of $37.0 at February 2, 2008 and $43.7 at February 3, 2007. We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the holiday period. During fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the holiday period accounted for 21 percent, 22 percent, and 21 percent, respectively, of our annual net sales. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods. 26 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments, while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short term investments. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2008 increased $124 million compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: $217 million less net maturities of short term investments in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; $142 million, which is net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in fiscal 2008; offset by $251 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2007 increased $124 million compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to $110 million more purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2009, we expect capital expenditures to be about $350 million. We expect to open about 50 new store locations and to close about 100 store locations. As a result, we expect net square footage to decrease about 2 percent for fiscal 2009. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments, and the repayment of debt, while cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share based compensation. Net cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2008 decreased $1.1 billion compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: $995 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; $188 million less repayments of long term debt in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; offset by $50 million less cash inflows from share based compensation in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Net cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2007 increased $1.0 billion compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to the following: $650 million more repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006; and $326 million more repayments of long term debt in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure. Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,412 $ 2,081 $ 1,250 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (431 ) (682 ) (572 ) Free cash flow $ 981 $ 1,399 $ 678 27 Table of Contents Debt The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our $50 million notes payable with a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent per annum was classified as current maturities of long term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2009 and was repaid in March 2009. In connection with this debt, we had a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of $50 million debt of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK, from a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent, payable in U.S. dollars, to 6.1 billion Japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of 2.43 percent. We also settled the cross currency interest rate swap in March 2009 and in connection with this settlement, we received, subsequent to January 31, 2009, $19 million as a return of collateral, which was classified as restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2009. In December 2008, we paid the remaining $138 million related to the maturity of our 8.80 percent notes payable and in September 2007, we paid $326 million related to the maturity of our 6.90 percent notes payable. Credit Facilities Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. Over the past three years, we have migrated most of our merchandise vendors to open account payment terms. As of January 31, 2009, our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate $100 million, three year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreements, with two separate banks, for a total aggregate availability of $200 million with an expiration date of May 2011. In addition, we have an $8 million revolving credit facility available for Athleta which is exclusively being used for the issuance of trade letters of credit to support its merchandise purchases. As of January 31, 2009, we had $83 million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements. We also have a $500 million, five year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2012 (the Facility). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop, working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $56 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $444 million as of January 31, 2009. The Facility and letter of credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements. Dividend Policy In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions. We increased our annual dividend, which had been $0.32 per share for fiscal 2007 and 2006, to $0.34 per share for fiscal 2008. We intend to maintain our annual dividend at $0.34 per share for fiscal 2009. 28 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program Since the beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company has repurchased approximately 340 million shares for $6.5 billion. In fiscal 2006, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of $1.3 billion, which were fully utilized in fiscal 2006 and 2007. In August 2007, the Board of Directors authorized $1.5 billion for share repurchases which was fully utilized in fiscal 2007. In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases, of which $745 million was utilized through January 31, 2009. In connection with the fiscal 2007 and 2008 authorizations, we entered into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family. We expect that approximately $158 million (approximately 16 percent) of the $1 billion share repurchase program will be purchased from Fisher family members (related party transactions) under these purchase agreements. The shares are purchased at the same weighted average market price that we are paying for share repurchases in the open market. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares for $745 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of $16.36. Approximately 7 million shares were repurchased for $117 million from the Fisher family. All except $40 million of total share repurchases were paid for as of January 31, 2009. Of the $40 million accrual, $21 million was payable to Fisher family members as of January 31, 2009. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 89 million shares for $1.7 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $19.05. Approximately 13 million shares were repurchased for $249 million from the Fisher family. All of the share repurchases were paid for as of February 2, 2008. In fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately 58 million shares for $1.1 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $17.97. Contractual Cash Obligations We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of January 31, 2009. These obligations impact our short term and long term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations. Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Less than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5Years Total Amounts reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheet: Debt (a) $ 50 $ $ $ $ 50 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (b) 3 3 Other cash obligations not reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheet: Operating leases (c) 1,069 1,639 906 1,080 4,694 Purchase obligations and commitments (d) 1,901 284 208 194 2,587 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,023 $ 1,923 $ 1,114 $ 1,274 $ 7,334 (a) Represents principal maturities, net of unamortized discount, excluding interest. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) The table above excludes $128 million of long term liabilities under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments of the long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will occur. The amount is included in lease incentives and other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2009. (c) Maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations are excluded. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases. (d) Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business. Commercial Commitments We have commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of $58 million (of which $56 million was 29 Table of Contents issued under the revolving credit facility lines), surety bonds of $38 million, and bank guarantees of $4 million outstanding at January 31, 2009. Amounts Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet We have other long term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including deferred income taxes. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal 2009 that are included in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off Balance Sheet Arrangements) The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) to operate certain aspects of our information technology structure. The agreement was amended March 2, 2009. The services agreement expires in March 2016, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $741 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract. We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 31, 2009. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation. We account for these guarantees in accordance with FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of the Indebtedness of Others. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $33 million as of January 31, 2009. The carrying amount of the liability related to the guarantees was not material as of January 31, 2009. We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million, of which $0.2 million has been cash collateralized. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes. 30 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10 K. Merchandise Inventory We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (LCM) and record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM reserve calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage reserves. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage reserves in the past three fiscal years. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets In accordance with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review the carrying value of long lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset. For assets that are identified as potentially being impaired, if the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated based on discounted future cash flows of the assets using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $5 million, $42 million, and $32 million for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The impairment charge in fiscal 2007 and 2006 included $29 million and $3 million, respectively, related to the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne. 31 Table of Contents In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to trade name. In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. The fair value of the reporting unit used to test goodwill for impairment and the fair value of the trade name are estimated using the income approach. This approach requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. We did not recognize any impairment charges for our goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal 2008, 2007, or 2006. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. Insurance and Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts, and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our insurance liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Revenue Recognition While revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy for the Company. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on estimated gross profit using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years. Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Vouchers Upon the purchase of a gift card or issuance of a gift certificate or voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (breakage). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded as other income, 32 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when it can be determined that the likelihood of redemption is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. During fiscal 2006, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift cards to three years from our prior estimate of five years and, as a result, recorded $31 million of other income in fiscal 2006. For gift certificates and vouchers, we recognize breakage income after five years. Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future earnings, taxable income, and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings, changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of audit by various taxing authorities. To the extent that our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, in accordance with FIN 48. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial position, statement of cash flows and results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations and forecasted royalty payments using foreign exchange forward contracts. We also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany loans and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding or issuing the intercompany loan or balance. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions, which are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2008 were U.S. dollars, Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value as of the balance sheet dates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $34 million at January 31, 2009 and $37 million at February 2, 2008. We do not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. We use a cross currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable of the $50 million debt of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK, from a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent, payable in U.S. dollars, to 6.1 billion Japanese yen with a fixed interest rate of 2.43 percent. This debt was repaid in March 2009. The fair value of this debt was $49 million and $51 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively and classified as current maturities of long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2009. In connection with the repayment of $50 million related to the maturity of this debt, we settled the corresponding cross currency interest rate swap in March 2009. In addition, we invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments are placed primarily in treasury and prime money market funds, domestic commercial paper, and bank securities. Our cash equivalents and short term investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair market value due to the short maturities of these instruments. An increase in interest rates of 10 percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $37 million, $117 million, and $131 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 34 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents
