Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are a global specialty retailer offering clothing, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel purchased from us under our brand names. In addition, our U.S. customers can shop online at gap.com, oldnavy.com, bananarepublic.com, piperlime.com, and athleta.com. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties. We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. Financial highlights for fiscal 2009 include the following: Net sales for fiscal 2009 were $14.2 billion compared with $14.5 billion for fiscal 2008, and comparable store sales decreased 3 percent compared with a decrease of 12 percent last year. Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 40.3 percent compared with 37.5 percent for fiscal 2008. Operating margin for fiscal 2009 was 12.8 percent compared with 10.7 percent for fiscal 2008. Net income for fiscal 2009 increased 14.0 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.58 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $967 million, or $1.34 per share on a diluted basis, for fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, we generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion compared with free cash flow of $981 million in fiscal 2008. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. As of January 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were $2.6 billion, with no debt outstanding. We believe our cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for the foreseeable future. Our business and financial priorities for fiscal 2010 are as follows: consistently delivering product that aligns with our target customers, with an overall objective of improving our sales trend while delivering healthy margins; maintaining a focus on cost management and return on invested capital; generating strong free cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders; and investing in the future while delivering earnings growth. As we continue to focus on regaining market share in North America in fiscal 2010, we also plan to expand internationally through the following: opening our first Gap stores in China and Italy; expanding Banana Republic in Europe; opening additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and Asia; and introducing our online shopping experience to customers in Canada and Europe. 18 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Sales Net Sales by Brand, Region, and Reportable Segment Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, wholesale and franchise revenues, and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. Gap and Banana Republic outlet retail sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment. Comparable Store Sales The percentage change in comparable store sales by brand and region and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 Gap North America (7 )% (8 )% Old Navy North America 3 % (17 )% Banana Republic North America (9 )% (10 )% International (4 )% (4 )% The Gap, Inc. (3 )% (12 )% Only the Company owned stores are included in the calculation of comparable store sales. The comparable store sales calculation excludes sales from our Direct reportable segment and our wholesale and franchise businesses. Gap and Banana Republic outlet comparable store sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. A store is included in comparable store sales (Comp) when it has been open for at least 12 months and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp store sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. A store is considered non comparable (Non comp) when it has been open for less than 12 months or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is considered Closed if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non comp status for the same days the following year. Store Count and Square Footage Information Net sales per average square foot is as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Net sales per average square foot (1) $ 329 $ 336 $ 376 (1) Excludes net sales associated with the Direct segment and our wholesale and franchise businesses. Computation also excludes net sales and average square footage associated with the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne for fiscal 2007. 19 Table of Contents Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our Company owned stores are as follows: January 31, 2009 Fiscal 2009 January 30, 2010 Number ofStore Locations Number ofStores Opened Number ofStores Closed Number ofStore Locations Square Footage(in millions) Gap North America 1,193 11 52 1,152 11.5 Gap Europe 173 10 5 178 1.6 Gap Asia 113 8 1 120 1.1 Old Navy North America 1,067 3 31 1,039 19.5 Banana Republic North America 573 14 11 576 4.9 Banana Republic Asia 27 27 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 3 1 1 3 Total 3,149 47 101 3,095 38.8 Decrease over prior year (1.7 )% (1.8 )% February 2, 2008 Fiscal 2008 January 31, 2009 Number ofStore Locations Number ofStores Opened Number ofStores Closed Number ofStore Locations Square Footage(in millions) Gap North America 1,249 13 69 1,193 11.8 Gap Europe 173 9 9 173 1.5 Gap Asia 110 8 5 113 1.0 Old Navy North America 1,059 34 26 1,067 20.1 Banana Republic North America 555 28 10 573 4.9 Banana Republic Asia 21 6 27 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 3 3 Total 3,167 101 119 3,149 39.5 Decrease over prior year (0.6 )% (0.3 )% Gap and Banana Republic outlet stores are reflected in each of the respective brands. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. There were 136 and 114 franchise stores open as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. Net Sales Discussion Our fiscal 2009 net sales decreased $329 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $417 million related to our Stores reportable segment, offset by an increase in net sales of $88 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our fiscal 2009 net sales decreased $417 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic as well as the $32 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if fiscal 2008 sales were translated at fiscal 2009 exchange rates. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 3 percent compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the continued difficult retail environment. For the Direct reportable segment, our fiscal 2009 net sales increased $88 million, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to incremental sales related to Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008. 20 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Our fiscal 2008 net sales decreased $1.2 billion, or 8 percent, compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $1.4 billion related to our Stores reportable segment, offset by an increase in net sales of $127 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our fiscal 2008 net sales decreased $1.4 billion, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in net sales at all of our brands due to the weakening retail environment and declines in traffic, offset by an increase in net sales from our franchise business and the $19 million favorable impact of foreign exchange. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if fiscal 2007 sales were translated at fiscal 2008 exchange rates. For the Direct reportable segment, our fiscal 2008 net sales increased $127 million, or 14 percent, compared with fiscal 2007 due to the growth in our online business across all brands and the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008. Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the following: the cost of merchandise; inventory shortage and valuation adjustments; freight charges; costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits; production costs; insurance costs related to merchandise; and rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization related to our store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions. The classification of these expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses may not be comparable to that of other companies. As a general business practice, we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear the majority of this merchandise. ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses $ 8,473 $ 9,079 $ 10,071 Gross profit $ 5,724 $ 5,447 $ 5,692 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 59.7 % 62.5 % 63.9 % Gross margin 40.3 % 37.5 % 36.1 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.8 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold decreased 2.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Occupancy expenses increased 0.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. For the Stores reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.7 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold decreased 2.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts and a decrease in selling at markdown. Occupancy expenses increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily driven by lower sales related to comparable stores. 21 Table of Contents For the Direct reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 3.5 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased 4.1 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts and a decrease in selling at markdown. Occupancy expenses, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, increased 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily driven by higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications and incremental expenses related to the integration of Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008. Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold decreased 3.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses increased 1.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. For the Stores reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold decreased 3.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease was driven by higher margins achieved for both regular price and marked down merchandise, primarily as a result of reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts. Occupancy expenses increased 1.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, primarily driven by lower net sales in fiscal 2008, and to a lesser extent, an increase in certain occupancy expenses. For the Direct reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, primarily driven by higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the following: payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions); marketing; general and administrative expenses; costs to design and develop our products; merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers and stores; distribution center general and administrative expenses; rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization for corporate facilities; and other expense (income). 22 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents The classification of these expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our operating expenses may not be comparable to that of other companies. ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Operating expenses $ 3,909 $ 3,899 $ 4,377 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 27.5 % 26.8 % 27.8 % Operating margin 12.8 % 10.7 % 8.3 % Operating expenses increased $10 million, or 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was mainly due to $78 million in increased marketing expenses primarily for Gap and Old Navy, offset by $68 million in decreased store payroll and benefits and other store related expenses. Operating expenses decreased $478 million, or 1.0 percent as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: $195 million in decreased corporate and divisional overhead expenses, primarily related to bonus, payroll, and employee benefits; $141 million in decreased store payroll and benefits; $88 million in decreased store related expenses associated with fewer remodels, fewer fixture rollouts, and less packaging and supplies; and $41 million in decreased marketing expenses, primarily for Gap and Old Navy. Interest Expense Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 6 $ 1 $ 26 Interest expense for fiscal 2008 includes an interest expense reversal of $9 million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from foreign tax audit events occurring in the period. Excluding this reversal, interest expense for fiscal 2008 was $10 million on overall borrowings and obligations. The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, net of interest expense reversal, was primarily due to the maturities of our $138 million, 8.80 percent notes repaid in December 2008 and $50 million, 6.25 percent notes repaid in March 2009. The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2008, excluding the reversal of interest expense, compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the maturity of our $326 million, 6.90 percent notes repaid in September 2007. Interest Income Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 7 $ 37 $ 117 Interest income is earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest income decreased for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. 23 Table of Contents Income Taxes Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Income taxes $ 714 $ 617 $ 539 Effective tax rate 39.3 % 39.0 % 38.3 % The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by the determination during fiscal 2009 that we no longer intend to utilize certain amounts of the undistributed earnings of our Canadian and Japanese subsidiaries in foreign operations indefinitely, the impact of changes in state tax laws, and a change in the mix of income between domestic and international operations. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by a change in the mix of income, with a higher relative percentage of fiscal 2008 income occurring in jurisdictions that impose higher relative tax rates. We currently expect the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of income between domestic and international operations, the overall level of income, and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies. Loss from Discontinued Operation, Net of Income Tax Benefit Loss from discontinued operation relates to the Forth & Towne brand, whose stores were closed by the end of June 2007. Loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne, net of income tax benefit, was $34 million for fiscal 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources: ($ in millions) January 30,2010 January 31,2009 February 2,2008 Cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and restricted cash $ 2,591 $ 1,756 $ 1,939 Debt $ $ 50 $ 188 Working capital (a) $ 2,533 $ 1,847 $ 1,653 Current ratio (a) 2.19:1 1.86:1 1.68:1 (a) Our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash. Our working capital and current ratio as of January 30, 2010 increased compared with January 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. See Cash Flows from Operating Activities below. As of January 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were $2.6 billion. Our cash flow generation remains healthy, and our cash position remains strong. We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be adequate to support our business operations, capital expenditures, and payments related to dividends and share repurchase activities for the foreseeable future. We are also able to supplement the near term liquidity, if necessary, with our existing $500 million revolving credit facility. 24 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities In fiscal 2009, net cash provided by operating activities increased $516 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: an increase in net income in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and a lower fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with the fiscal 2007 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2008; For fiscal 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $669 million compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following: an increased balance in accounts payable in fiscal 2007 due to the change in vendor payment terms; a higher payout during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 related to the fiscal 2007 bonus compared with the prior year comparable period; a decrease in the gift card, gift certificate, and credit voucher liability due to more redemptions than issuances in fiscal 2008, compared with more issuances than redemptions in fiscal 2007; decreases in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities related to information technology projects and advertising expenses; offset by higher net income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Inventory management remains an area of focus. Inventory per square foot at January 30, 2010 was relatively flat compared with inventory per square foot at January 31, 2009. We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of short term investments, while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short term investments. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2009 increased $139 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: $401 million due to net purchases of short term investments in fiscal 2009 compared with net maturities in fiscal 2008; offset by $142 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008; and $97 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2008 increased $124 million compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following: $217 million less net maturities of short term investments in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; $142 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008; offset by $251 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. 25 Table of Contents For fiscal 2010, we expect capital expenditures to be about $575 million. We expect to open about 65 new store locations and close about 110 store locations. As a result, we expect net square footage to decrease about 3 percent for fiscal 2010. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments, and the repayment of debt. Cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share based compensation, net of withholding tax payments. Net cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2009 decreased $234 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: $158 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and $88 million less repayments of long term debt in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Net cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2008 decreased $1.1 billion compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following: $995 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; $188 million less repayments of long term debt in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; offset by $50 million less cash inflows from share based compensation in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure. Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,928 $ 1,412 $ 2,081 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (334 ) (431 ) (682 ) Free cash flow $ 1,594 $ 981 $ 1,399 Credit Facilities Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. Most of our merchandise vendors are now on open account payment terms. As of January 30, 2010, our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate $100 million, three year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreements, with two separate banks, for a total aggregate availability of $200 million with an expiration date of May 2011. As of January 30, 2010, we had $24 million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements. We also have a $500 million, five year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2012 (the Facility). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a 26 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 30, 2010, there were no borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $56 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $444 million as of January 30, 2010. The Facility and letter of credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements. Dividend Policy In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions. We increased our annual dividend, which had been $0.32 per share for fiscal 2007, to $0.34 per share for fiscal 2008 and 2009. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.40 per share for fiscal 2010. Share Repurchase Program Since the beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company has repurchased approximately 364 million shares for $7.0 billion. In fiscal 2006 and 2007, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, which were both fully utilized by the end of fiscal 2007. In February 2008, the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for additional share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of fiscal 2009. In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase program, of which $255 million was utilized through January 30, 2010. This authorization was fully utilized in March 2010. In connection with the fiscal 2007, 2008, and 2009 authorizations, we entered into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family (related party transactions). The Fisher family shares were purchased at the same weighted average market price that we paid for share repurchases in the open market. The purchase agreements were terminable upon 15 business days notice by the Company or individual Fisher family members. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 24 million shares for $510 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of $21.30. Approximately 2 million of these shares were repurchased for $40 million from the Fisher family. All of the share repurchases were paid for as of January 30, 2010 except $3 million that was payable to Fisher family members. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares for $745 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of $16.36, and approximately 7 million of these shares were repurchased for $117 million from the Fisher family. In fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 89 million shares for $1.7 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $19.05, and approximately 13 million of these shares were repurchased for $249 million from the Fisher family. In February 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for additional share repurchases. We have not entered into purchase agreements with members of the Fisher family in connection with this authorization. 27 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of January 30, 2010. These obligations impact our short term and long term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations.

Commercial Commitments We have commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of $58 million (of which $56 million was issued under the revolving credit facility lines), surety bonds of $40 million, and bank guarantees of $7 million outstanding at January 30, 2010. Amounts Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet We have other long term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including deferred income taxes. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal 2010 that are recorded in current liabilities. Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off Balance Sheet Arrangements) The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with IBM to operate certain aspects of our information technology structure. The agreement was amended March 2, 2009. The services agreement expires in March 2016, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $623 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract. 28 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 30, 2010. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $31 million as of January 30, 2010. The carrying amount of the liability related to the guarantees was approximately $2 million as of January 30, 2010. We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million, of which $0.2 million has been cash collateralized. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10 K. Merchandise Inventory We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (LCM), with cost determined using the weighted average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM reserve calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates. 29 Table of Contents We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage reserves. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage reserves in the past three fiscal years. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of long lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset. For long lived assets that are identified as potentially being impaired, if the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. The fair value of the asset group is estimated based on discounted future cash flows of the asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $14 million, $5 million, and $42 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The impairment charge in fiscal 2007 included $29 million related to the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne. In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to the trade name. The carrying values of goodwill and the trade name were $99 million and $54 million, respectively, as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 and were allocated to the Direct reportable segment. We review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. We have deemed the Direct reportable segment to be the reporting unit for goodwill acquired through the acquisition of Athleta. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit used to test goodwill for impairment is estimated using the income approach. The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method. These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, expenses, discount rates, and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill and the trade name and did not recognize any impairment charges. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value as of the date of our annual impairment review. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. Insurance and Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the 30 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our insurance liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Revenue Recognition While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on the estimated margin using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years. Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (breakage). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. Based on our historical information, the likelihood of gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers remaining unredeemed can be determined three years after issuance. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed an analysis of historical redemption patterns for our gift certificates and credit vouchers. Based on this analysis, additional data led us to conclude that three years after the gift certificate or credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. As such, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and credit vouchers to three years from our prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009. For gift cards, we also recognize breakage income after three years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual rate of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. 31 Table of Contents At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial position, statement of cash flows, and results of operations. 32 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations and forecasted royalty payments using foreign exchange forward contracts. We also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the intercompany balance. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009 were Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value as of the balance sheet dates. As of January 30, 2010, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy the notional amount of $695 million, 23 million British pounds, and 3 billion Japanese yen. We may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries. At January 30, 2010, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our Japanese subsidiary and Canadian subsidiaries in the notional amount of 2 billion Japanese yen and 81 million Canadian dollars, respectively. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of January 30, 2010 based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at January 30, 2010. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $30 million at January 30, 2010. We invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are placed primarily in money market funds, domestic commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are classified as held to maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market value due to the short maturities of these instruments. An increase in interest rates of 10 percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $7 million in fiscal 2009. 33 Table of Contents
