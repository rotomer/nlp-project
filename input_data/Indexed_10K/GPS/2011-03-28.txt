Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are a global specialty retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We have Company operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. In addition, our products are available to customers online in over 90 countries. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties. We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. Financial highlights for fiscal 2010 include the following: Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 3 percent to $14.7 billion compared with $14.2 billion for fiscal 2009, and comparable store sales increased 1 percent compared with a decrease of 3 percent last year. Direct net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 16 percent to $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009. Our Direct reportable segment includes sales for each of our online brands. Net sales for Direct and international as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 2 percent to 22 percent compared with 20 percent for fiscal 2009. Operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 13.4 percent compared with 12.8 percent for fiscal 2009. Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percentage of net sales. Net income for fiscal 2010 increased 9.3 percent to $1.2 billion compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.88 for fiscal 2010 compared with $1.58 for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion compared with free cash flow of $1.6 billion for fiscal 2009. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Our business and financial priorities for fiscal 2011 are as follows: grow revenues by consistently delivering product that resonates with our target customers around the world; maintain a focus on cost management and return on invested capital; generate strong free cash flow and return cash to shareholders; and invest in the future while delivering earnings per share growth. As we focus on growing revenues in our more mature North America market in fiscal 2011, we plan to continue growing revenues internationally through the following: opening additional stores, many of which will be outlets, in Canada, Europe, and Asia; continuing to open franchise stores worldwide; and continuing to offer our online shopping experience to customers in international locations. 20 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Sales Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, wholesale and franchise revenues, and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment. Comparable Store Sales The percentage change in comparable store (Comp) sales by brand and region and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: Fiscal Year 2010 2009 Gap North America (1 )% (7 )% Old Navy North America 2 % 3 % Banana Republic North America 3 % (9 )% International 1 % (4 )% The Gap, Inc. 1 % (3 )% Only the Company operated stores are included in the calculation of Comp sales. The Comp sales calculation excludes sales from our online and catalog businesses and wholesale and franchise businesses. Gap and Banana Republic outlet Comp sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. A store is included in Comp when it has been open for at least 12 months and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. A store is considered non comparable (Non comp) when it has been open for less than 12 months or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is considered Closed if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non comp status for the same days the following year. Beginning in fiscal 2011, the Company reports comparable sales including the associated comparable online sales. Online comparable sales are defined as sales through online channels in regions where we have existing comparable store sales. The Companys comparable sales including the associated comparable online sales increased 2 percent for fiscal 2010. Store Count and Square Footage Information Net sales per average square foot is as follows: Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Net sales per average square foot (1) $ 342 $ 329 $ 336 (1) Excludes net sales associated with our online, catalog, wholesale, and franchise businesses. 21 Table of Contents Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows: January 30, 2010 Fiscal 2010 January 29, 2011 Number ofStore Locations Number ofStores Opened Number ofStores Closed Number ofStore Locations Square Footage(in millions) Gap North America 1,152 12 53 1,111 11.1 Gap Europe 178 12 6 184 1.6 Gap Asia 120 17 2 135 1.3 Old Navy North America 1,039 18 30 1,027 19.0 Banana Republic North America 576 6 6 576 4.9 Banana Republic Asia 27 2 29 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 3 3 1 5 0.1 Athleta North America 1 1 Company operated stores total 3,095 71 98 3,068 38.2 Franchise 136 47 5 178 N/A Total 3,231 118 103 3,246 38.2 Increase (decrease) over prior year 0.5 % (1.5 )% January 31, 2009 Fiscal 2009 January 30, 2010 Number ofStore Locations Number ofStores Opened Number ofStores Closed Number ofStore Locations Square Footage(in millions) Gap North America 1,193 11 52 1,152 11.5 Gap Europe 173 10 5 178 1.6 Gap Asia 113 8 1 120 1.1 Old Navy North America 1,067 3 31 1,039 19.5 Banana Republic North America 573 14 11 576 4.9 Banana Republic Asia 27 27 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 3 1 1 3 Company operated stores total 3,149 47 101 3,095 38.8 Franchise 114 28 6 136 N/A Total 3,263 75 107 3,231 38.8 Decrease over prior year (1.0 )% (1.8 )% Gap and Banana Republic outlet stores are reflected in each of the respective brands. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. We expect to open about 115 new Company operated store locations and close about 125 Company operated store locations in fiscal 2011. As a result of these net store closures and through downsizes, we expect net square footage for Company operated stores to decrease about 3 percent for fiscal 2011. We also expect to open about 75 new franchise stores in fiscal 2011. Net Sales Discussion Our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $467 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2009 due to an increase in net sales of $286 million related to our Stores reportable segment and an increase in net sales of $181 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $286 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales at our new international stores, an increase in comparable store sales of 1 percent, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $116 million. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for fiscal 2009 were translated at fiscal 2010 exchange rates. 22 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $181 million, or 16 percent, compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was due to the growth in our online business across all brands, primarily Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta, and due to the introduction of international online sales in fiscal 2010. Our net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $329 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2008 due to a decrease in net sales of $417 million related to our Stores reportable segment, partially offset by an increase in net sales of $88 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $417 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic and the $32 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for fiscal 2008 were translated at fiscal 2009 exchange rates. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 3 percent compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the continued difficult retail environment. For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2009 increased $88 million, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to incremental sales related to Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008. Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses $ 8,775 $ 8,473 $ 9,079 Gross profit $ 5,889 $ 5,724 $ 5,447 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 59.8 % 59.7 % 62.5 % Gross margin 40.2 % 40.3 % 37.5 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.1 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Cost of goods sold increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by lower margins for both regular price and marked down merchandise. Occupancy expenses decreased 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The decrease in occupancy expenses was primarily driven by reduced expenses due to store closures and fully depreciated assets, partially offset by higher expenses due to store remodels and international store openings and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $22 million. Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.8 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold decreased 2.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts and a decrease in selling at markdown. Occupancy expenses increased 0.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications and incremental expenses related to the integration of Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008. 23 Table of Contents Operating Expenses ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Operating expenses $ 3,921 $ 3,909 $ 3,899 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 26.7 % 27.5 % 26.8 % Operating margin 13.4 % 12.8 % 10.7 % Operating expenses increased $12 million, but decreased 0.8 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher store payroll, store benefits, and other store related expenses and higher expenses due to our New York and San Francisco headquarter office moves, partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense. Operating expenses increased $10 million, or 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was mainly due to increased marketing expenses primarily for Gap and Old Navy, offset by decreased store payroll and benefits and other store related expenses. Interest Expense ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense (reversal) $ (8 ) $ 6 $ 1 Interest expense for fiscal 2010 includes an interest expense reversal of $15 million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from the filing of a U.S. federal income tax accounting method change application and the resolution of the IRSs review of the Companys federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2006. Interest expense for fiscal 2008 includes an interest expense reversal of $9 million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from foreign tax audit events occurring in the period. The decrease in interest expense, net of interest expense reversal, for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the maturities of our $138 million, 8.80 percent notes repaid in December 2008 and $50 million, 6.25 percent notes repaid in March 2009. Interest Income ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ (6 ) $ (7 ) $ (37 ) Interest income is earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to lower cash balances during fiscal 2010. Interest income decreased for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates. Income Taxes ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Income taxes $ 778 $ 714 $ 617 Effective tax rate 39.3 % 39.3 % 39.0 % Although the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 remained unchanged from fiscal 2009, there were changes in individual components of the effective tax rate. The tax impact of foreign operations increased primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances related to losses incurred by our China subsidiaries and incremental tax expense 24 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents related to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiaries. The increase was primarily offset by the release of unrecognized tax benefits for closed years. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by providing U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings, the impact of changes in state tax laws, and a change in the mix of income between domestic and international operations. We currently expect the fiscal 2011 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of income between domestic and international operations, the overall level of income, the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies, and changes in tax laws and rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, payment of taxes, and share repurchases. In addition to share repurchases, we also continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources: ($ in millions) January 29,2011 January 30,2010 January 31,2009 Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 1,661 $ 2,573 $ 1,715 Debt $ 3 $ $ 50 Working capital $ 1,831 $ 2,533 $ 1,847 Current ratio 1.87:1 2.19:1 1.86:1 Our working capital and current ratio as of January 29, 2011 decreased compared with January 30, 2010, primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. See Cash Flows discussed below. As of January 29, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were $1.7 billion. Our operating cash flow generation and cash position remain strong. We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives and planned capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near term liquidity, if necessary, with our existing $500 million revolving credit facility. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2010 decreased $184 million compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: an increase in inventory purchases in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; a higher fiscal 2009 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with the fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009; partially offset by an increase in net income in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2009 increased $516 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: an increase in net income in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and a lower fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with the fiscal 2007 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2008; 25 Table of Contents We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end of year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from maturities of investments. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2010 decreased $108 million compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: $350 million more net maturities of short term investments in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; partially offset by $223 million more purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; and $17 million less release of restricted cash in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2009 increased $139 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: $401 million more net purchases of short term investments in fiscal 2009 compared with net maturities in fiscal 2008; offset by $142 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008; and $97 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be about $575 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. Cash inflows primarily consist of proceeds from share based compensation, net of withholding tax payments. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2010 increased $1.4 billion compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: $1.4 billion more repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2009 decreased $234 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: 158 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and $88 million less repayments of long term debt in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results. 26 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure. Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,744 $ 1,928 $ 1,412 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (557 ) (334 ) (431 ) Free cash flow $ 1,187 $ 1,594 $ 981 Credit Facilities Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. In September 2010, we amended and extended one of our $100 million letter of credit agreements and concurrently terminated our second $100 million letter of credit agreement. As of January 29, 2011, we had a $100 million, two year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreement with an expiration date of September 2012. As of January 29, 2011, we had $1 million in trade letters of credit issued under this letter of credit agreement. We also have a $500 million, five year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2012 (the Facility). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 29, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $49 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $451 million as of January 29, 2011. The Facility and letter of credit agreement contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreement, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement. In September 2010, we entered into two separate agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China (the China Facilities). The China Facilities are available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and issuance of bank guarantees. The 196 million Chinese yuan (approximately $30 million as of January 29, 2011) China Facilities are scheduled to expire in August 2011. As of January 29, 2011, there were borrowings of $3 million (18 million Chinese yuan) at an interest rate of 5.08 percent. The net availability of the China Facilities, reflecting these borrowings, was approximately $27 million (178 million Chinese yuan) as of January 29, 2011. The China Facility agreements do not contain any covenants. Dividend Policy In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions. We increased our annual dividend, which had been $0.34 per share for fiscal 2008 and 2009, to $0.40 per share for fiscal 2010. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.45 per share for fiscal 2011. 27 Table of Contents Share Repurchases In February 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of August 2010. In August 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million for share repurchases, of which $711 million was utilized through January 29, 2011. In February 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 96 million shares for $2.0 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $20.44. Contractual Cash Obligations We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of January 29, 2011. These obligations impact our short term and long term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations. Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Less than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5Years Total Amounts reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheet: Debt (a) $ 3 $ $ $ $ 3 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (b) 1 1 Other cash obligations not reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheet: Operating leases (c) 997 1,551 1,085 1,483 5,116 Purchase obligations and commitments (d) 2,217 234 183 8 2,642 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,218 $ 1,785 $ 1,268 $ 1,491 $ 7,762 (a) Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) The table above excludes $66 million of long term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. The amount is recorded in lease incentives and other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 29, 2011. (c) Maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations are excluded. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases. (d) Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business. Commercial Commitments We have commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of $51 million (of which $49 million was issued under the revolving credit facility lines), surety bonds of $40 million, and bank guarantees of $11 million outstanding at January 29, 2011. Amounts Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet We have other long term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including deferred income taxes. The payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal 2011 that are recorded in current liabilities. 28 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off Balance Sheet Arrangements) The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations include our non exclusive services agreement with IBM to operate certain aspects of our information technology structure. The services agreement expires in March 2016, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $486 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract. We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 29, 2011. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $21 million as of January 29, 2011. There was no liability recorded for the guarantees as of January 29, 2011. We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As party to a reinsurance pool for workers compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10 K. 29 Table of Contents Merchandise Inventory We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (LCM), with cost determined using the weighted average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of long lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset. Long lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million, $14 million, and $5 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to the trade name. The carrying values of goodwill and the trade name were $99 million and $54 million, respectively, as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 and were allocated to the Direct reportable segment. We review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. We have deemed the Direct reportable segment to be the reporting unit for goodwill acquired through the acquisition of Athleta. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit used to test goodwill for impairment is estimated using the income approach. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill and did not recognize any impairment charges. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value as of the date of our annual impairment review. The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment review of the trade name and did not recognize any impairment charges. 30 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, expenses, discount rates, and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. Insurance and Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our insurance liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Revenue Recognition While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on the estimated margin using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years. Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (breakage). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed an analysis of historical redemption patterns for our gift certificates and credit vouchers. Based on this analysis, additional data led us to conclude that three years after the gift certificate or credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. As such, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and credit vouchers to three years from our prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009. For gift cards, we also recognize breakage income after three years. 31 Table of Contents We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual rate of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate breakage income in the past three fiscal years other than noted above. Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

FORM 10 K Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases denominated primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies, forecasted intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as of the balance sheet dates. As of January 29, 2011, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy the notional amount of $1 billion, 54 million British pounds, and 3 billion Japanese yen. We may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries. At January 29, 2011, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our Japanese subsidiary in the notional amount of 3 billion Japanese yen. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of January 29, 2011 based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at January 29, 2011. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $47 million at January 29, 2011. We invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are placed primarily in money market funds, domestic commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are classified as held to maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market value due to the short maturities. An increase in interest rates of 10 percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $6 million in fiscal 2010. 33 Table of Contents
