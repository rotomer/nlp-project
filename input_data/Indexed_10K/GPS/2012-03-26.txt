Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are a global specialty retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We have Company operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. In addition, our products are available to customers online in over 90 countries. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties. We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. Fiscal 2011 was a challenging year. Unemployment remained high in our core North America markets and the apparel retail environment was quite promotional. The debt crisis in Europe increased stock market volatility globally, and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan had a negative impact on our business in Asia. Our largest expense, cost of goods sold, escalated sharply in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of global cotton price inflation, putting significant pressure on our margins, especially in the second half of fiscal 2011. Finally, we had product challenges throughout fiscal 2011 in our domestic and international businesses. As a result, earnings for fiscal 2011 were below last year. Despite these challenges, we are pleased with the progress we made against our long term strategic plan, including growing our online business and expanding internationally. We also continued to reduce our square footage in North America through closures and consolidations at Gap and downsizes at Old Navy. We managed our operating expenses carefully. We delivered higher average selling price per unit throughout the year, enabled by our disciplined inventory management. We generated $815 million of free cash flow and distributed $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Financial results for fiscal 2011 are as follows: Net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased 1 percent to $14.5 billion compared with $14.7 billion for fiscal 2010. Comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, for fiscal 2011 decreased 4 percent compared with a 2 percent increase last year. Direct net sales for fiscal 2011 increased 20 percent to $1.6 billion compared with $1.3 billion for fiscal 2010. Our Direct reportable segment includes sales for each of our online brands. Net sales generated outside of the U.S. and Canada, including online, for fiscal 2011 were $3.7 billion, and as a percentage of total net sales, increased 4 percent to 26 percent compared with 22 percent for fiscal 2010. Gross profit for fiscal 2011 was $5.3 billion compared with $5.9 billion for fiscal 2010. Gross margin for fiscal 2011 was 36.2 percent compared with 40.2 percent for fiscal 2010. Operating expenses for fiscal 2011 decreased 2 percent to $3.8 billion compared with fiscal 2010 and decreased 0.3 percent as a percentage of net sales. Operating margin for fiscal 2011 was 9.9 percent compared with 13.4 percent for fiscal 2010. Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percentage of net sales. Net income for fiscal 2011 was $833 million compared with $1.2 billion for fiscal 2010. Diluted earnings per share decreased 17 percent to $1.56 for fiscal 2011 compared with $1.88 for fiscal 2010. 19 Table of Contents In fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $815 million compared with free cash flow of $1.2 billion for fiscal 2010. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased about 111 million shares for $2.1 billion. Our business and financial priorities for fiscal 2012 are as follows: improve sales with healthy merchandise margins; invest in our business while maintaining discipline; and return excess cash to shareholders. As we focus on stabilizing comparable store sales in fiscal 2012, we also plan to grow revenues through the following: opening additional stores, many of which will be outlets, in Asia, Canada, and Europe; continuing to open franchise stores worldwide; and opening additional Athleta stores. Results of Operations Net Sales Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, and wholesale and franchise revenues. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment. Comparable Sales Beginning in fiscal 2011, the Company reports comparable (Comp) sales including the associated comparable online sales. Accordingly, Comp sales for fiscal 2010 have been recalculated to conform to fiscal 2011 presentation. The percentage change in Comp sales by brand and region and for total Company, including the associated comparable online sales, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Gap North America (4 )% % Old Navy North America (3 )% 3 % Banana Republic North America (1 )% 3 % International (7 )% 2 % The Gap, Inc. (4 )% 2 % The percentage change in Comp store sales by brand and region and for total Company, excluding the associated comparable online sales, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: Fiscal Year 2011 2010 Gap North America (6 )% (1 )% Old Navy North America (6 )% 2 % Banana Republic North America (2 )% 3 % International (9 )% 1 % The Gap, Inc. (6 )% 1 % 20 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Only Company operated stores are included in the calculations of Comp sales. Gap and Banana Republic outlet Comp sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. The results for Athleta are excluded from the calculations of total Company Comp sales due to its number of Comp stores compared to our other brands. The results for Piperlime are excluded from the calculations of total Company Comp sales, as Piperlime is an online only brand. A store is included in the Comp sales calculations when it has been open for at least one calendar year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. A store is considered non comparable (Non comp) when it has been open for less than one calendar year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is considered Closed if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non comp status for the same days the following year. Online Comp sales are defined as sales through online channels in countries where we have existing Comp store sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. Store Count and Square Footage Information Net sales per average square foot is as follows: Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Net sales per average square foot (1) $ 337 $ 342 $ 329 (1) Excludes net sales associated with our online, catalog, wholesale, and franchise businesses. 21 Table of Contents Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows: January 29, 2011 Fiscal 2011 January 28, 2012 Number ofStore Locations Number ofStores Opened Number ofStores Closed Number ofStore Locations Square Footage(in millions) Gap North America 1,111 23 91 1,043 10.7 Gap Europe 184 14 5 193 1.7 Gap Asia 135 22 5 152 1.5 Old Navy North America 1,027 32 43 1,016 18.1 Banana Republic North America 576 14 9 581 4.9 Banana Republic Asia 29 3 1 31 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 5 5 10 0.1 Athleta North America 1 9 10 Company operated stores total 3,068 122 154 3,036 37.2 Franchise 178 52 3 227 N/A Total 3,246 174 157 3,263 37.2 Increase (decrease) over prior year 0.5 % (2.6 )% January 30, 2010 Fiscal 2010 January 29, 2011 Number ofStore Locations Number ofStores Opened Number ofStores Closed Number ofStore Locations Square Footage(in millions) Gap North America 1,152 12 53 1,111 11.1 Gap Europe 178 12 6 184 1.6 Gap Asia 120 17 2 135 1.3 Old Navy North America 1,039 18 30 1,027 19.0 Banana Republic North America 576 6 6 576 4.9 Banana Republic Asia 27 2 29 0.2 Banana Republic Europe 3 3 1 5 0.1 Athleta North America 1 1 Company operated stores total 3,095 71 98 3,068 38.2 Franchise 136 47 5 178 N/A Total 3,231 118 103 3,246 38.2 Increase (decrease) over prior year 0.5 % (1.5 )% Gap and Banana Republic outlet stores are reflected in each of the respective brands. In addition, we have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. In fiscal 2012, net of repositions, we expect to open about 125 new Company operated store locations and close about 115 Company operated store locations. Through downsizes and net store closures, we expect net square footage for Company operated stores to decrease about 1 percent for fiscal 2012. As a result of ongoing strategic closures and consolidations at Gap brand, we expect to have a total of about 950 Gap stores in North America by the end of fiscal 2013. We expect our franchisees to open about 50 new franchise stores in fiscal 2012. 22 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Net Sales Discussion Our net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased $115 million, or 1 percent, compared with fiscal 2010 due to a decrease in net sales of $376 million related to our Stores reportable segment, partially offset by an increase in net sales of $261 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased $376 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Comp store sales, excluding the associated comparable online sales, of 6 percent for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $156 million and an increase in franchise sales. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for fiscal 2010 were translated at fiscal 2011 exchange rates. For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $261 million, or 20 percent, compared with fiscal 2010. The increase was due to the growth in our online business across all brands and the incremental sales related to the introduction of international online sales in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, our net sales, including Direct, for the U.S. and Canada were $12.4 billion, a decrease of $353 million or 3 percent compared with $12.7 billion for fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, our net sales, including Direct, outside of the U.S. and Canada were $2.2 billion, an increase of $238 million or 12 percent compared with $1.9 billion for fiscal 2010. Our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $467 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2009 due to an increase in net sales of $286 million related to our Stores reportable segment and an increase in net sales of $181 million related to our Direct reportable segment. For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $286 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales at our new international stores, an increase in Comp store sales, excluding the associated comparable online sales, of 1 percent, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $116 million. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for fiscal 2009 were translated at fiscal 2010 exchange rates. For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $181 million, or 16 percent, compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was due to the growth in our online business across all brands, primarily Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta, and the incremental sales related to the introduction of international online sales in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, our net sales, including Direct, for the U.S. and Canada were $12.7 billion, an increase of $259 million or 2 percent compared with $12.5 billion for fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, our net sales, including Direct, outside of the U.S. and Canada were $1.9 billion, an increase of $208 million or 12 percent compared with $1.7 billion for fiscal 2009. Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses $ 9,275 $ 8,775 $ 8,473 Gross profit $ 5,274 $ 5,889 $ 5,724 Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 63.8 % 59.8 % 59.7 % Gross margin 36.2 % 40.2 % 40.3 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 4.0 percent in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Cost of goods sold increased 3.7 percent as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by increased cost of merchandise primarily due to higher cotton prices. 23 Table of Contents Occupancy expenses increased 0.3 percent as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. The increase in occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by lower net sales for the Stores reportable segment without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses, partially offset by higher net sales for the Direct reportable segment. Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.1 percent in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Cost of goods sold increased 0.7 percent as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by lower margins for both regular price and marked down merchandise. Occupancy expenses decreased 0.6 percent as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The decrease in occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by reduced expenses due to store closures and fully depreciated assets, partially offset by higher expenses due to store remodels and international store openings and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $22 million. Operating Expenses ($ in millions) Operating expenses Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 $ 3,836 $ 3,921 $ 3,909 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 26.4 % 26.7 % 27.5 % Operating margin 9.9 % 13.4 % 12.8 % Operating expenses decreased $85 million, or 0.3 percent as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to higher income from fees earned under the private label and co branded credit card agreements, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses. Operating expenses increased $12 million, but decreased 0.8 percent as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher store payroll, store benefits, and other store related expenses and higher expenses due to our New York and San Francisco headquarter office moves, partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense. Interest Expense (Reversal) ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense (reversal) $ 74 $ (8 ) $ 6 Interest expense for fiscal 2011 primarily consists of interest expense related to our $1.25 billion long term debt, which was issued in April 2011, and $400 million term loan, which was funded in May 2011. Interest expense for fiscal 2010 includes an interest expense reversal of $15 million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from the filing of a U.S. federal income tax accounting method change application and the resolution of the Internal Revenue Services review of the Companys federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2006. Interest Income ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ (5 ) $ (6 ) $ (7 ) 24 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Interest income is earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a lower monthly average cash and cash equivalents and investments balance during fiscal 2011. The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a lower monthly average cash and cash equivalents and investments balance during fiscal 2010. Income Taxes ($ in millions) Fiscal Year 2011 2010 2009 Income taxes $ 536 $ 778 $ 714 Effective tax rate 39.2 % 39.3 % 39.3 % While the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 decreased slightly compared with fiscal 2010, there were changes in individual components of the effective tax rate. State and other income taxes decreased primarily due to changes in state tax laws and increases in state and federal tax credits. The decreases in these components were offset by the tax impact of foreign operations, which increased primarily due to operating losses in China and Hong Kong for fiscal 2011 (for which no tax benefit has been provided), and their greater impact due to lower Gap Inc. pre tax income for fiscal 2011, as well as the unfavorable impact of a change in the mix of income between domestic and foreign operations. Although the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 remained unchanged from fiscal 2009, there were changes in individual components of the effective tax rate. The tax impact of foreign operations increased primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances related to losses incurred by our China subsidiaries and incremental tax expense related to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiaries. The increase was primarily offset by the release of unrecognized tax benefits for closed years. We currently expect the fiscal 2012 effective tax rate to be about 39.5 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of income between domestic and international operations, the overall level of income, the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies, and changes in tax laws and rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, payment of taxes, and share repurchases. In addition to share repurchases, we also continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we made the strategic decision to issue debt in the aggregate amount of $1.65 billion. Given favorable market conditions and our history of generating consistent and strong operating cash flow, we took this step to provide a more optimal capital structure. The Company has generated annual cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion per year for the past decade and ended fiscal 2011 with $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources: ($ in millions) January 28,2012 January 29,2011 January 30,2010 Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments $ 1,885 $ 1,661 $ 2,573 Debt $ 1,665 $ 3 $ Working capital $ 2,181 $ 1,831 $ 2,533 Current ratio 2.02:1 1.87:1 2.19:1 As of January 28, 2012, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held in the U.S. and is generally accessible without any limitations. 25 Table of Contents We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives and planned capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2011 decreased $381 million compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the following: a decrease in net income in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2010 decreased $184 million compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: an increase in inventory purchases in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; a higher fiscal 2009 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with the fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009; partially offset by an increase in net income in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end of year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year end and subsequent interim periods. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash outflows for investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from maturities of investments. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2011 increased $25 million compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the following: $25 million less net maturities of short term investments in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2010 decreased $108 million compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: $350 million more net maturities of short term investments in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; partially offset by $223 million more purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; and $17 million less release of restricted cash in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2011, capital expenditures were $548 million. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $600 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. Cash inflows primarily consist of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2011 decreased $1.5 billion compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the following: $1.65 billion of proceeds from our issuance of long term debt in fiscal 2011; partially offset by $133 million more repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. 26 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2010 increased $1.4 billion compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following: $1.4 billion more repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP result. The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure. Fiscal Year ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,363 $ 1,744 $ 1,928 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (548 ) (557 ) (334 ) Free cash flow $ 815 $ 1,187 $ 1,594 Long Term Debt In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes (the Notes) due April 2021 and received proceeds of $1.24 billion in cash, net of underwriting and other fees. Interest is payable semi annually on April 12 and October 12 of each year and commenced on October 12, 2011. We have an option to call the Notes in whole or in part at any time, subject to a make whole premium. The Notes agreement is unsecured and does not contain any financial covenants. In April 2011, we also entered into a $400 million, five year, unsecured term loan due April 2016, which was funded in May 2011. Repayments of $40 million are payable on April 7 of each year, commencing on April 7, 2012, with a final repayment of $240 million due on April 7, 2016. In addition, interest is payable at least quarterly based on an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings. The term loan agreement contains financial and other covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 and a maximum annual leverage ratio of 2.25. As of January 28, 2012, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the term loan agreement, which would require the immediate repayment of outstanding amounts. Credit Facilities In April 2011, we replaced our existing $500 million, five year, unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in August 2012, with a new $500 million, five year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility), which is scheduled to expire in April 2016. The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The Facility fees fluctuate based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically LIBOR) plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 28, 2012, there were no borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $43 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $457 million as of January 28, 2012. On April 7, 2011, we obtained new long term senior unsecured credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Moodys assigned a rating of Baa3, and Fitch assigned a rating of BBB . Standard & Poors Rating Service (Standard & Poors) continues to rate us BB+. As of January 28, 2012, there were 27 Table of Contents no changes in these credit ratings. Any future reduction in the Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings would increase our interest expense related to our $400 million term loan and any future interest expense if we were to draw on the Facility. If a one notch reduction in our Moodys or Standard & Poors ratings were to occur during fiscal 2012, the increase in our interest expense for fiscal 2012 would be immaterial. In September 2010, we entered into two separate agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China (the China Facilities). The China Facilities are uncommitted and are available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and the issuance of bank guarantees. The 196 million Chinese yuan (approximately $31 million as of January 28, 2012) China Facilities were set to expire in August 2011 but were renewed under substantially similar terms through September 2012. As of January 28, 2012, there were borrowings of $19 million (118 million Chinese yuan) at an interest rate of 6.53 percent under the China Facilities. The net availability of the China Facilities, reflecting these borrowings and $1 million in bank guarantees related to store leases, was approximately $11 million as of January 28, 2012. The China Facility agreements do not contain any financial covenants. As of January 28, 2012, we also had a $100 million, two year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreement with an expiration date of September 2012. As of January 28, 2012, we had no trade letters of credit issued under this letter of credit agreement. Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. The Facility and letter of credit agreement contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 and a maximum annual leverage ratio of 2.25. As of January 28, 2012, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreement, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement. Dividend Policy In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions. We increased our annual dividend, which had been $0.40 per share for fiscal 2010, to $0.45 per share for fiscal 2011. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.50 per share for fiscal 2012. Share Repurchases Between February 2010 and November 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a total of $4.25 billion for share repurchases, of which $443 million under the November 2011 authorization was remaining as of January 28, 2012. In February 2012, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the November 2011 authorization and cancelled the $441 million remaining under the November 2011 authorization as of February 23, 2012. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 111 million shares for $2.1 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of $18.88. 28 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of January 28, 2012.

Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off Balance Sheet Arrangements) The majority of our contractual obligations relate to operating leases for our stores. Future minimum lease payments represent commitments under non cancelable operating leases and are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our other off balance sheet arrangements are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting 29 Table of Contents policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10 K. Merchandise Inventory We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (LCM), with cost determined using the weighted average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets We review the carrying amount of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long lived asset. Long lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying amount. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available, which for retail stores is at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded a charge for the impairment of long lived assets of $16 million, $8 million, and $14 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated to the Direct reportable segment. In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill was $99 million as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. Effective October 30, 2011, we adopted an accounting standards update to simplify the testing of goodwill for impairment. As such, we review goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is 30 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents unnecessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test is required to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the two step goodwill impairment test is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta to be a component of our Direct operating segment, as it is the level at which segment management regularly reviews operating results and makes resource allocation decisions. However, as Athleta is aggregated with other components of the Direct operating segment due to the components having similar economic characteristics, we have deemed our Direct operating segment to be the single reporting unit at which goodwill is tested for impairment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and did not recognize any impairment charges. We determined that as of the date of our annual impairment review, the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeded its carrying amount, and it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Direct reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $54 million of the purchase price to the trade name. The carrying amount of the trade name was $54 million as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. The trade name is considered impaired if the estimated fair value of the trade name is less than the carrying amount. If the trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed our annual impairment review of the trade name. The fair value of the trade name significantly exceeded its carrying value as of the date of our annual impairment review, and we did not recognize any impairment charges. These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, expenses, discount rates, and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. Insurance and Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially determined amounts and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our insurance liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 31 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash, debit card, or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We sell merchandise to franchisees under multi year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs when the merchandise reaches the franchisees pre designated turnover point. We also receive royalties from franchisees based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee, net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years. Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (breakage). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote, which is three years after the gift certificate or credit voucher is issued. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed an analysis of historical redemption patterns for our gift certificates and credit vouchers. Based on this analysis, additional data led us to conclude that three years after the gift certificate or credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. As such, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and credit vouchers to three years from our prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009. For gift cards, we also recognize breakage income after three years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual rate of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate breakage income in the past three fiscal years other than noted above. Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. 32 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 33 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Derivative Financial Instruments We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases denominated primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies, forecasted intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward contracts. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as of the balance sheet dates. As of January 28, 2012, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy the notional amount of $873 million, 31 million British pounds, 16 million Euro, and 2.6 billion Japanese yen related to our forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations, forecasted intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk. As of January 28, 2012, we did not have any foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our subsidiaries. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of January 28, 2012 based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect as of January 28, 2012. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $39 million as of January 28, 2012. Short Term Borrowings In September 2010, we entered into two separate agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China (the China Facilities). The China Facilities are set to expire in September 2012. As of January 28, 2012, there were borrowings of $19 million (118 million Chinese yuan) at an interest rate of 6.53 percent under the China Facilities. We do not expect the interest rate of the borrowings under the China Facilities for fiscal 2012 to differ materially from the rate of 6.53 percent as of January 28, 2012. Long Term Debt In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent Notes due April 2021 and received proceeds of $1.24 billion in cash, net of underwriting and other fees. Interest is payable semi annually on April 12 and October 12 of each year and commenced on October 12, 2011. The Notes are not subject to market risk, as they have a fixed interest rate. In April 2011, we also entered into a $400 million, five year, unsecured term loan due April 2016, which was funded in May 2011. Repayments of $40 million are payable on April 7 of each year, commencing on April 7, 2012, with a final repayment of $240 million due on April 7, 2016. In addition, interest is payable at least quarterly based on an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings. The average interest rate during fiscal 2011 was 2 percent. 34 GAP INC. FORM 10 K Table of Contents Our interest rate risk associated with the term loan as of January 28, 2012 is as follows: Expected Maturity Date (Fiscal Year) ($ in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Value (1) Principal payments $ 40 $ 40 $ 40 $ 40 $ 240 $ $ 400 $ 400 Average interest rate (2) 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % (1) The carrying amount of the term loan approximates its fair value, as the interest rate varies depending on market rates and our credit rating. (2) The average interest rate for all periods presented was calculated based on LIBOR plus a margin, including fees, based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings as of January 28, 2012. As the interest rate for the term loan is variable, it is subject to change for all periods presented. Cash Equivalents We have highly liquid fixed and variable income investments classified as cash equivalents, which are placed primarily in money market funds, time deposits, and commercial paper. These investments are classified as held to maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. The value of our investments is not subject to material interest rate risk. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $5 million in fiscal 2011. 35 Table of Contents
