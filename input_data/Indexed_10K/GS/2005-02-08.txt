Our activities are divided into three segments: Investment Banking. We provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Trading and Principal Investments. We facilitate customer transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and take proprietary positions through market making in, and trading of, fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities and derivatives on such products. In addition, we engage in floor based and electronic market making as a specialist on U.S. equities and options exchanges and we clear customer transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and other investment activities, we make principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage. Asset Management and Securities Services. We offer a broad array of investment strategies, advice and planning across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide, and provide prime brokerage, financing services and securities lending services to mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, foundations and high net worth individuals worldwide. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all references to 2004, 2003 and 2002 refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, November 26, 2004, November 28, 2003 and November 29, 2002, respectively. When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, we, us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to the Annual Report on Form 10 K are to our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended November 26, 2004. In this discussion, we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. These statements relate to our future plans and objectives, among other things. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the results indicated in these forward looking statements. Important factors, among others, that could cause our results to differ, possibly materially, from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed below under Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business as well as Business Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Executive Overview Our diluted earnings per share were $8.92 for 2004, a 52% increase compared with 2003. Return on average tangible shareholders equity was 25.2% (1) and return on average shareholders equity was 19.8%. Our results in 2004 reflected strong growth in Trading and Principal Investments, Asset Management and Securities Services, and Investment Banking. The increase in Trading and (1) Return on average tangible shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings by average monthly tangible shareholders equity. See Results of Operations included below for further information regarding our calculation of return on average tangible shareholders equity. 43 Table of Contents Principal Investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC), as all major businesses and regions performed well in a generally favorable environment. Net revenues in our Principal Investments business also increased significantly, due to an unrealized gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG), as well as gains from other corporate principal investments. In addition, Equities net revenues improved, primarily reflecting higher customer driven activity and favorable market conditions early in 2004, but results remained below the peak levels achieved in 2001 and 2000. Equities operated in a less favorable environment after our first fiscal quarter of 2004, as volatility levels continued to decline and markets generally lacked direction before moving higher in the last several weeks of our fiscal year. Asset Management and Securities Services generated strong net revenue growth, primarily reflecting higher average assets under management, increased incentive fees and significantly higher customer balances in Securities Services. In Investment Banking, net revenues increased for the first time in three years, highlighted by strong growth in our Financial Advisory and Equity Underwriting businesses, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity. Our investment banking backlog at the end of 2004 was higher than at the end of 2003.(2) Our operating results in 2004 reflected improvement in the economic environment as well as a number of trends that have emerged in recent years. We continued to see increased trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves in 2004 and, consequently, we increased our market risk during the year to capitalize on these opportunities. Our Investment Banking results reflected our best performance in three years as corporate activity began to recover, although competitive pressures remained. In our Equities business, although our results were higher compared with 2003 as customer driven activity improved, commission rates continued to decline and demands for us to commit capital remained significant. In the regulatory environment, financial services firms continued to be under intense scrutiny, with the scope of such scrutiny unabated in the last year. Consequently, the volume and amount of claims against financial institutions and other related costs remained significant in 2004. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses can be expected to remain high. Though our operating results were strong in 2004, our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable earnings. Our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally. For a further discussion of these trends and other factors affecting our businesses, see Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business included below as well as Business Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Environment As an investment banking, securities and investment management firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by low inflation, low and declining interest rates, and strong equity markets. Over the business cycle, these factors provide a positive climate for our investment banking activities, for many of our trading businesses and for wealth creation, which contributes to growth in our asset management business. Although geopolitical uncertainty continued and inflation was slightly higher, interest rates, although rising, remained low, merger activity improved, and global equity prices, although spending much of the year in a fairly narrow range, generally increased. For a further discussion of how market conditions can affect our businesses, see Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business included below as well as Business Certain Factors That May Affect Our (2) Our investment banking backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. 44 Table of Contents Business in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. A further discussion of the business environment in 2004 is set forth below. Global. After improving during the second half of 2003, growth in the global economy continued to improve during 2004, with worldwide real gross domestic product in the calendar year growing at one of its highest rates in the last twenty years. The pace of growth was particularly strong in the first half of 2004, but slowed throughout the remainder of the year. The Japanese economy grew very strongly early in 2004 but slowed significantly after the first quarter. After rising early in our fiscal year, global equity markets spent much of the year in a fairly narrow range, but many of the major markets rallied beginning in late October, leading to solid gains over the year. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve began to raise its federal funds rate target in June 2004, fixed income markets generally performed well, as long term bond yields ended the year close to, or below the levels at the beginning of the year, and corporate credit spreads remained tight. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar weakened further against the major currencies, though the weakening was generally smaller than in 2003 and occurred largely at the end of our fiscal year. Corporate activity, as measured by industry wide completed and announced mergers and acquisitions as well as equity underwriting volumes, increased significantly during the year, reflecting the continued economic recovery and strengthening equity markets. In addition, industry wide debt origination volumes remained strong. United States. The U.S. economy grew at a strong pace during the year. Real gross domestic product in the 2004 calendar year rose by approximately 4.4%. Although quarterly growth fell from the very high level seen in the third quarter of 2003, it remained strong throughout the year. A brief softening in consumer spending led to a decline in quarterly real gross domestic product growth during the second calendar quarter, but the pace of economic growth appears to have accelerated again in subsequent quarters. Strong economic and productivity growth contributed to strong corporate profit growth during the year. Inflation increased throughout the year. In response to the improving environment and rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points in June, and subsequently raised rates a further 75 basis points by the end of our fiscal year to 2.0%. Despite rising short term interest rates, long term yields moved higher only briefly, for several months around midyear, and ended the year close to levels at the beginning of the year. With the U.S. dollar weakening further, financial conditions remained supportive of economic activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the SP 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased 8%, 12% and 7%, respectively, during our fiscal year. Europe. Economic conditions improved in Europe during 2004. Real gross domestic product growth in the Eurozone economies rose to approximately 1.8% in the 2004 calendar year, a significant improvement from the previous two years, as domestic demand rose and export performance improved. Growth in the Eurozone economies appears to have been stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, as consumer spending slowed from the strong first quarter, and the strengthening euro, in part, restrained economic activity later in the year. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged through the year, but long term bond yields fell significantly in response to signs of softer economic activity and the sharp rise in the euro in late 2004. The U.K. economy recorded strong growth in 2004, though real gross domestic product growth slowed significantly during the third quarter. After starting to raise interest rates in November 2003, the Bank of England raised interest rates during 2004 by 100 basis points. The FTSE 100 Index increased 9% during our fiscal year. Asia. Japans economy grew very strongly in early 2004, though the pace of growth slowed significantly after the first calendar quarter, as investment spending and export growth slowed. Despite slowing after the first quarter, consumer spending growth remained strong through much of 2004 and corporate profitability continued to improve. The Bank of Japan continued to provide substantial liquidity to the market and continued to hold short term interest rates at zero percent through the year. The Ministry of Finance ceased intervention to support the Japanese yen in March 2004 and the yen remained generally strong. Bond yields rose significantly in the middle of 45 Table of Contents the year but subsequently declined in line with global trends, while the Nikkei 225 Index increased 7% during our fiscal year. Growth in other Asian economies remained very strong in 2004, reflecting strong global demand growth, though the pace of economic growth appears to have peaked in many economies around the middle of the year. Chinas growth generally remained firm, though the pace of growth slowed in the middle of the year, as administrative measures to slow certain parts of the economy had a dampening effect on investment spending. Inflation generally rose throughout the year and, in October, the Central Bank of China increased interest rates for the first time since July 1995, raising its benchmark lending rate by 27 basis points. Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal and regulatory risks. For a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks, see Risk Management included below. A summary of some of the important factors that could affect our business follows below. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business, see Business Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Market Conditions and Market Risk. Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. Business conditions continued to improve in 2004, after improving somewhat during the second half of 2003: the number and size of equity underwritings and completed mergers and acquisitions transactions increased significantly in 2004, after declining for three straight years, and fixed income origination levels remained strong; fixed income market conditions remained generally favorable, as interest rates, although rising, remained low by historical standards, and corporate credit spreads remained narrow; and in the global equity markets, although volatility levels and commission rates continued to decline, price levels and volumes were generally stronger. Adverse or uncertain economic and market conditions have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability in many ways, including the following: We have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years. Increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid, may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses. We have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading, specialist and investment positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions. Conversely, our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses. Industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions and increased price competition may have an adverse effect on our revenues and, because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly, our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions, a decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our investment banking business. Reductions in the level of the equity markets also tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios, which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets. Even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions, investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors 46 Table of Contents could result in a decline in assets under management and, therefore, in the incentive and management fees we receive. Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making, proprietary trading, block trading, merchant banking, underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading businesses or commit capital to facilitate primarily client driven business. For example, large blocks of stock are increasingly being sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis, which increases the risk Goldman Sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities at favorable prices. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry. We also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses. The number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period. The volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and as a specialist may decline, which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In our specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in a declining market. This may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity. Weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. For a further discussion of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, see Critical Accounting Policies Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets included below. If any of the variety of instruments, processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Credit Risk. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years, as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposure. As a clearing member firm, we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. In addition, we have experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend credit and price more aggressively the credit risks we take. In particular, corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs. Liquidity Risk. Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or an inability to sell assets. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time. Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under such provisions, counterparties could be permitted to 47 Table of Contents terminate contracts with Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements. For a discussion of the potential impact on Goldman Sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings, see Capital and Funding Credit Ratings included below. Operational Risk. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. Shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems could lead to, among other consequences, financial loss and reputational damage. In addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by Goldman Sachs or third parties with which we conduct business. Legal and Regulatory Risk. Substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against Goldman Sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing. For a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures, see Use of Estimates included below. Critical Accounting Policies Fair Value Total financial instruments owned, at fair value and Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations. The use of fair value to measure these financial instruments, with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations, is fundamental to our financial statements and is our most critical accounting policy. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 48 Table of Contents In determining fair value, we separate our financial instruments into three categories cash (i.e., nonderivative) trading instruments, derivative contracts and principal investments, as set forth in the following table: Financial Instruments by Category (in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Financial Financial Financial Instruments Sold, Financial Instruments Sold, Instruments But Not Yet Instruments But Not Yet Owned, At Purchased, At Owned, At Purchased, At Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Cash trading instruments $ 143,376 $ 68,096 $ 110,157 $ 60,813 Derivative contracts 62,495 64,001 45,733 41,886 Principal investments 4,654 (1) 3,755 (1) Total $ 210,525 $ 132,097 $ 159,645 $ 102,699 (1) Excludes assets of $1.28 billion and $1.07 billion in consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds as of November 2004 and November 2003, respectively. Cash Trading Instruments. Fair values of our cash trading instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, broker or dealer price quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of instruments valued in this manner include U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, liquid mortgage products, investment grade corporate bonds, listed equities, money market securities, state, municipal and provincial obligations, and physical commodities. Certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and, therefore, have little or no price transparency. Such instruments may include certain high yield debt, corporate bank loans, mortgage whole loans and distressed debt. We value these instruments using methodologies such as the present value of known or estimated cash flows and generally do not adjust underlying valuation assumptions unless there is substantive evidence supporting a change in the value of the underlying instrument or valuation assumptions (such as similar market transactions, changes in financial ratios and changes in credit ratings of the underlying companies). 49 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the valuation of our cash trading instruments by level of price transparency: Cash Trading Instruments by Price Transparency (in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Financial Financial Financial Instruments Sold, Financial Instruments Sold, Instruments But Not Yet Instruments But Not Yet Owned, At Purchased, At Owned, At Purchased, At Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Quoted prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable price transparency $ 130,908 $ 67,948 $ 102,306 $ 60,673 Little or no price transparency 12,468 148 7,851 140 Total $ 143,376 $ 68,096 $ 110,157 $ 60,813 Cash trading instruments we own (long positions) are marked to bid prices and instruments we have sold but not yet purchased (short positions) are marked to offer prices. If liquidating a position is reasonably expected to affect its prevailing market price, our valuation is adjusted generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies. In certain circumstances, such as for highly illiquid positions, managements estimates are used to determine this adjustment. Derivative Contracts. Derivative contracts consist of exchange traded and over the counter (OTC) derivatives. The following table sets forth the fair value of our exchange traded and OTC derivative assets and liabilities: Derivative Assets and Liabilities (in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Exchange traded derivatives $ 5,464 $ 5,905 $ 5,182 $ 6,339 OTC derivatives 57,031 58,096 40,551 35,547 Total (1) $ 62,495 $ 64,001 $ 45,733 $ 41,886 (1) The fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities include cash we have paid and received (for example, option premiums or cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements) and may change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, changes in our trading positions and market movements. 50 Table of Contents Fair values of our exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices. OTC derivatives are valued using valuation models. We use a variety of valuation models including the present value of known or estimated cash flows, option pricing models and option adjusted spread models. The valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our OTC derivatives require inputs including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. The selection of a model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Where possible, we verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available. For OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, model selection requires more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in the market. As markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available, we continue to review and refine the models that we use. At the inception of an OTC derivative contract (day one), we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer and credit considerations. These adjustments are generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies. In certain circumstances, such as for highly illiquid positions, managements estimates are used to determine these adjustments. Where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions, we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and, consequently, record no day one gain or loss in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Following day one, we adjust the inputs to our valuation models only to the extent that changes in such inputs can be verified by similar market transactions, third party pricing services and or broker quotes or can be derived from other substantive evidence such as empirical market data. In circumstances where we cannot verify the model to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. 51 Table of Contents The following tables set forth the fair values of our OTC derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity: OTC Derivatives (in millions) As of November 2004 Assets 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,475 $ 451 $ 5,682 $ 4,250 $ 12,743 $ 24,601 Currencies 9,570 1,499 3,670 2,320 1,198 18,257 Commodities 2,943 1,164 5,581 1,108 160 10,956 Equities 1,311 813 457 634 2 3,217 Total $ 15,299 $ 3,927 $ 15,390 $ 8,312 $ 14,103 $ 57,031 Liabilities 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,854 $ 789 $ 7,366 $ 7,136 $ 5,658 $ 22,803 Currencies 9,577 1,580 4,456 2,755 1,184 19,552 Commodities 3,791 1,425 4,522 814 107 10,659 Equities 1,409 1,304 1,114 1,084 171 5,082 Total $ 16,631 $ 5,098 $ 17,458 $ 11,789 $ 7,120 $ 58,096 As of November 2003 Assets 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,470 $ 160 $ 4,017 $ 4,332 $ 9,541 $ 19,520 Currencies 5,486 1,230 4,069 1,842 897 13,524 Commodities 1,538 645 1,648 473 159 4,463 Equities 1,276 637 675 329 127 3,044 Total $ 9,770 $ 2,672 $ 10,409 $ 6,976 $ 10,724 $ 40,551 Liabilities 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 2,026 $ 381 $ 3,896 $ 2,894 $ 2,475 $ 11,672 Currencies 5,993 1,121 2,951 2,949 828 13,842 Commodities 2,059 921 1,461 232 183 4,856 Equities 3,267 669 1,027 182 32 5,177 Total $ 13,345 $ 3,092 $ 9,335 $ 6,257 $ 3,518 $ 35,547 We enter into certain OTC option transactions that provide us or our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the underlying contract. The fair value of these option contracts is not material to the aggregate fair value of our OTC derivative portfolio. In the tables above, for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument, the classification of the remaining contractual maturity is generally based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument. In those instances when the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash, the remaining contractual maturity date is generally based upon the option expiration date. 52 Table of Contents Price transparency for OTC derivative model inputs varies depending on, among other factors, product type, maturity and the complexity of the contract. Price transparency for interest rate and currency contracts varies by the underlying currencies, with the currencies of the leading industrialized nations having the most price transparency. Price transparency for commodity contracts varies by type of underlying commodity. Price transparency for equity contracts varies by market, with the equity markets of the leading industrialized nations having the most price transparency. Price transparency is inherently more limited for more complex structures because they often combine one or more product types, requiring additional inputs such as correlations and volatilities. Principal Investments. In valuing our corporate and real estate principal investments, we separate our portfolio into investments in private companies, investments in public companies (excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG) and our investment in SMFG. The following table sets forth the carrying value of our principal investments portfolio: Principal Investments (in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Corporate Real Estate Total Corporate Real Estate Total Private $ 935 $ 769 $ 1,704 $ 1,054 $ 757 $ 1,811 Public 343 51 394 219 42 261 Subtotal 1,278 820 2,098 1,273 799 2,072 SMFG convertible preferred stock (1) 2,556 2,556 1,683 1,683 Total (2) $ 3,834 $ 820 $ 4,654 $ 2,956 $ 799 $ 3,755 (1) The fair value of our Japanese yen denominated investment in SMFG convertible preferred stock includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation. We hedge our economic exposure to exchange rate movements on our investment in SMFG by borrowing Japanese yen. Foreign exchange revaluation on the investment and the related borrowing are generally equal and offsetting. For example, if the Japanese yen appreciates against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar carrying value of our SMFG investment will increase and the U.S. dollar carrying value of the related borrowing will also increase by an amount that is generally equal and offsetting. (2) Excludes assets of $1.28 billion and $1.07 billion in consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds as of November 2004 and November 2003, respectively. Our private principal investments, by their nature, have little or no price transparency. Such investments are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value. Downward adjustments are also made, in the absence of third party transactions, if we determine that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value. In reaching that determination, we consider many factors including, but not limited to, the operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies or properties relative to budgets or projections, trends within sectors and or regions, underlying business models, expected exit timing and strategy, and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment, such as conversion features and liquidation preferences. Our public principal investments, which tend to be large, concentrated holdings that result from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions, are valued using quoted market prices discounted for restrictions on sale. If liquidating a position is reasonably expected to affect market prices, valuations are adjusted accordingly based on predetermined written policies. 53 Table of Contents Our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG is carried at fair value, which is derived from a model that incorporates SMFGs common stock price and credit spreads, the impact of nontransferability and illiquidity and the downside protection on the conversion strike price. The fair value of our investment is particularly sensitive to movements in the SMFG common stock price. As a result of transfer restrictions and the downside protection on the conversion strike price, the relationship between changes in the fair value of our investment and changes in SMFGs common stock price is nonlinear. During the fiscal year, the fair value of our investment increased 42% (expressed in Japanese yen), primarily due to an increase in the SMFG common stock price and the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock. Goldman Sachs has the right to convert our preferred stock investment in SMFG into shares of SMFG common stock beginning on February 8, 2005. The current conversion price is 322,300, but this price is subject to downward adjustment if the price of SMFG common stock at the time of conversion is less than the conversion price (subject to a floor of 106,300). Our convertible preferred investment is generally nontransferable. One third of the underlying shares of SMFG common stock will become transferable on February 8, 2005, with the remaining shares of common stock becoming transferable in equal installments on February 7, 2006 and February 7, 2007. In addition, restrictions on our ability to hedge the underlying common stock will lapse in three equal annual installments beginning on February 7, 2005. Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. Proper controls, independent of the trading and principal investing functions, are fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately and consistently valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important in valuing instruments with lower levels of price transparency. We employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties. Senior management, independent of the trading functions, is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and procedures and reporting the results of such work to the Audit Committee. We seek to maintain the necessary resources, with the appropriate experience and training, to ensure that control and independent price verification functions are performed to the highest standards. In addition, we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets, independent price verification, review of daily profit and loss, and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets. For a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses, see Risk Management included below. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets As a result of our business combinations, principally with SLK LLC (SLK) in fiscal 2000, we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. Goodwill. We test the goodwill in each of our operating segments for impairment at least annually in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value. We derive the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples. We derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the assets of each operating segment. Our last annual impairment test was performed during our fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and no impairment was identified. 54 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment: Goodwill by Operating Segment (in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Investment Banking Financial Advisory $ $ Underwriting 125 125 Trading and Principal Investments FICC 135 117 Equities (1) 2,382 2,384 Principal Investments Asset Management and Securities Services Asset Management (2) 423 419 Securities Services 117 117 Total $ 3,182 $ 3,162 (1) Primarily related to our combinations with SLK and The Hull Group. (2) Primarily related to our combination with The Ayco Company, L.P. (Ayco). Identifiable Intangible Assets. We amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in accordance with SFAS No. 142, and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2003, the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange all announced proposed restructuring plans and continued to experience loss of market share to the International Securities Exchange, which became the leading U.S. options exchange during 2003. Consequently, we tested our related option specialist rights for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2003, and recognized an impairment charge of $133 million. The estimated fair value of the option specialist rights was derived from estimated discounted cash flows. We also surrendered certain option specialist rights in earlier quarters of 2003, recognizing total charges of $20 million. There were no intangible asset impairments in fiscal 2004. 55 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the carrying value and range of remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class: Identifiable Intangible Assets by Asset Class ($ in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Range of Remaining Carrying Useful Lives Carrying Value (in years) Value Customer lists (1) $ 828 7 20 $ 880 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) specialist rights 607 23 26 636 Exchange traded fund (ETF) and option specialist rights 121 23 130 Other (2) 133 3 8 174 Total $ 1,689 $ 1,820 (1) Primarily includes our clearance and execution and Nasdaq customer lists acquired in our combination with SLK and financial counseling customer lists acquired in our combination with Ayco. (2) Primarily includes technology related assets acquired in our combination with SLK. A prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets. In addition, an announced restructuring by the NYSE or any other exchange on which we hold specialist rights or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator could indicate a potential impairment of the associated identifiable intangible assets. Use of Estimates The use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits. We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation matters, particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for information on our judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings. Results of Operations The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter 56 Table of Contents term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. For a further discussion of the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations, see Business Environment and Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business included above, and Business Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Financial Overview The following table sets forth an overview of our financial results: Financial Overview ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 Net revenues $ 20,550 $ 16,012 $ 13,986 Pre tax earnings 6,676 4,445 3,253 Net earnings 4,553 3,005 2,114 Diluted earnings per share 8.92 5.87 4.03 Return on average shareholders equity (1) 19.8 % 15.0 % 11.3 % Return on average tangible shareholders equity (2) 25.2 % 19.9 % 15.3 % (1) Return on average shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings by average monthly shareholders equity. (2) Tangible shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that return on average tangible shareholders equity is a meaningful measure of performance because it excludes the portion of our shareholders equity attributable to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. As a result, this calculation measures corporate performance in a manner that treats underlying businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Return on average tangible shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings by average monthly tangible shareholders equity. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of average shareholders equity to average tangible shareholders equity: Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Average shareholders equity $ 22,975 $ 20,031 $ 18,659 Deduct: Average goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (4,918 ) (4,932 ) (4,837 ) Average tangible shareholders equity $ 18,057 $ 15,099 $ 13,822 Net Revenues 2004 versus 2003. Our net revenues were $20.55 billion in 2004, an increase of 28% compared with 2003, reflecting strong growth in Trading and Principal Investments, Asset Management and Securities Services, and Investment Banking. The increase in Trading and Principal Investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in FICC, as all major businesses and regions performed well in a generally favorable environment. Net revenues in our Principal Investments business also increased significantly, due to an unrealized gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, as well as gains from other corporate principal investments. In addition, Equities net revenues improved, primarily reflecting higher customer driven activity and favorable market conditions early in 2004. Equities operated in a less favorable environment after our first fiscal quarter of 2004, as volatility levels continued to decline and markets generally lacked direction before moving higher in the last several weeks of our fiscal year. Asset Management and Securities Services generated strong revenue growth, primarily reflecting higher average assets 57 Table of Contents under management, increased incentive fees and significantly higher customer balances in Securities Services. In Investment Banking, net revenues also increased, highlighted by strong growth in both our Financial Advisory and Equity Underwriting businesses, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity. 2003 versus 2002. Our net revenues were $16.01 billion in 2003, an increase of 14% compared with 2002, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments. The increase in Trading and Principal Investments net revenues was primarily driven by FICC, which operated in a generally favorable environment throughout 2003, and by Principal Investments, which included an unrealized gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG. Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services increased 14% compared with 2002, primarily reflecting higher average assets under management and higher customer balances in Securities Services. Net revenues in Investment Banking declined 4% compared with 2002, due to generally lower levels of corporate activity. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. A substantial portion of our compensation expense represents discretionary bonuses, with our overall compensation and benefits expenses generally targeted at 50% (plus or minus a few percentage points) of consolidated net revenues. In addition to the level of net revenues, our compensation expense in any given year is also influenced by, among other factors, prevailing labor markets, business mix and the structure of our equity based compensation programs. The following table sets forth our operating expenses and number of employees: Operating Expenses and Employees ($ in millions) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 Compensation and benefits $ 9,591 $ 7,393 $ 6,744 Amortization of employee initial public offering and acquisition awards 61 122 293 Non compensation expenses 4,222 4,052 3,696 Total operating expenses $ 13,874 $ 11,567 $ 10,733 Employees at year end (1) 20,722 19,476 19,739 (1) Excludes 1,206, 1,228 and 876 employees as of November 2004, November 2003 and November 2002, respectively, of Goldman Sachs consolidated property management and loan servicing subsidiaries. Compensation and benefits includes $164 million, $134 million and $140 million for the years ended November 2004, November 2003 and November 2002, respectively, attributable to these subsidiaries, the majority of which is reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the investment funds for which these companies manage properties and perform loan servicing. Such reimbursements are recorded in net revenues. All three years exclude employees of certain consolidated entities that are held for investment purposes only. 2004 versus 2003. Operating expenses were $13.87 billion for 2004, 20% above 2003. Compensation and benefits expenses of $9.59 billion increased 30% compared with 2003, due to higher discretionary compensation, reflecting higher net revenues, and increased employment levels. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2004 was 46.7% compared with 46.2% for 2003. Employment levels increased 6% compared with November 2003. The adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, in fiscal 2003 did not have a material effect on our results of operations in 2004 or 2003, because 58 Table of Contents substantially all of the employee equity based compensation granted for each year was in the form of restricted stock units. See Note 2 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our stock based compensation. Non compensation related expenses of $4.22 billion for 2004 increased 4% compared with 2003. Other expenses included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $103 million for 2004 compared with $159 million for 2003. Excluding these provisions, other expenses increased $258 million, primarily due to the acquisition of consolidated entities held for investment purposes, increased levels of business activity and higher charitable contributions. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased, reflecting higher transaction volumes in certain of our businesses, and market development expenses were higher, primarily reflecting $62 million in connection with our establishment of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Company Limited in China, as well as higher levels of business activity. In addition, professional fees were higher, primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by decreased amortization of identifiable intangible assets (2003 included impairment charges of $188 million, primarily in respect of option specialist rights) as well as lower occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses. Total exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space, which were included in occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses, were $41 million for 2004 compared with $153 million for 2003. See Critical Accounting Policies Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets included above for a discussion of our impairment charges in respect of option specialist rights and Capital and Funding Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments, included below, for a discussion of our excess office space. 2003 versus 2002. Operating expenses were $11.57 billion for 2003, 8% above 2002. Compensation and benefits expenses of $7.39 billion increased 10% compared with 2002, with higher discretionary compensation more than offsetting lower levels of employment. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2003 was 46.2%, down from 48.2% for 2002, in part reflecting lower employment levels in 2003, which decreased 1% compared with November 2002. Excluding employees associated with our combination with Ayco, employment levels were down 7% from November 2002. Effective for fiscal 2003, we began to account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, using the prospective adoption method. The adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 did not have a material effect on our results of operations because substantially all of the employee equity based compensation granted for 2003 was in the form of restricted stock units. See Note 2 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our stock based compensation. Non compensation related expenses of $4.05 billion for 2003 increased 10% compared with 2002. This increase was primarily due to (i) higher other expenses, which included net provisions of $159 million for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings; (ii) increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets, reflecting impairment charges of $188 million, primarily in respect of option specialist rights; and (iii) exit costs of $153 million associated with reductions in our global office space. These exit costs were primarily reflected in occupancy expenses, with the balance in depreciation and amortization expenses. Excluding the aggregate charges of $500 million described above, our 2003 non compensation expenses declined slightly compared with 2002, reflecting lower depreciation and amortization, communications and technology, and market development expenses, and brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, partially offset by higher professional fees, primarily reflecting increased legal fees. The expense declines were primarily due to the impact of reduced employment levels, lower levels of business activity and continued cost containment discipline. 59 Table of Contents Provision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2004 was 31.8%, down from 32.4% for 2003. The change in the effective income tax rate for 2004 compared with 2003 reflected a decrease in state and local taxes and the effect of audit settlements. The effective income tax rate for 2003 of 32.4% was down from 35.0% in 2002. The decline in the effective income tax rate for 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to an increase in tax credits and a decrease in state and local taxes. Our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings, the level of our tax credits and the effect of tax audits. Certain of these and other factors, including our history of pre tax earnings, are taken into account in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our provision for taxes. Segment Operating Results The following table sets forth the net revenues, operating expenses and pre tax earnings of our segments: Segment Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 Investment Banking Net revenues $ 3,374 $ 2,711 $ 2,830 Operating expenses 2,973 2,504 2,454 Pre tax earnings $ 401 $ 207 $ 376 Trading and Principal Net revenues $ 13,327 $ 10,443 $ 8,647 Investments Operating expenses 8,287 6,938 6,505 Pre tax earnings $ 5,040 $ 3,505 $ 2,142 Asset Management and Net revenues $ 3,849 $ 2,858 $ 2,509 Securities Services Operating expenses 2,430 1,890 1,562 Pre tax earnings $ 1,419 $ 968 $ 947 Total Net revenues $ 20,550 $ 16,012 $ 13,986 Operating expenses (1) 13,874 11,567 10,733 Pre tax earnings $ 6,676 $ 4,445 $ 3,253 (1) Includes the following expenses that have not been allocated to our segments: (i) the amortization of employee initial public offering awards, net of forfeitures, of $19 million, $80 million and $212 million for the years ended November 2004, November 2003 and November 2002, respectively; (ii) net provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings of $103 million and $155 million for the years ended November 2004 and November 2003, respectively, and (iii) $62 million in connection with the establishment of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Company Limited, an investment banking and securities venture in China, for the year ended November 2004. Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and interest expense to specific securities, commodities and other positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such underlying positions. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our segments. 60 Table of Contents The cost drivers of Goldman Sachs taken as a whole compensation, headcount and levels of business activity are broadly similar in each of our business segments. Compensation expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of Goldman Sachs as well as the performance of individual business units. Consequently, pre tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A discussion of segment operating results follows. Investment Banking Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components: Financial Advisory. Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin offs. Underwriting. Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of equity, equity related and debt instruments. The following table sets forth the operating results of our Investment Banking segment: Investment Banking Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 Financial Advisory $ 1,737 $ 1,202 $ 1,499 Equity underwriting 819 678 734 Debt underwriting 818 831 597 Total Underwriting 1,637 1,509 1,331 Total net revenues 3,374 2,711 2,830 Operating expenses 2,973 2,504 2,454 Pre tax earnings $ 401 $ 207 $ 376 The following table sets forth our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Banking Volumes (1) (in billions) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 Announced mergers and acquisitions $ 436 $ 430 $ 313 Completed mergers and acquisitions 515 354 414 Equity and equity related offerings (2) 52 41 48 Debt offerings (3) 232 250 203 (1) Source: Thomson Financial. Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity related offerings and debt offerings volumes are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. (2) Includes public common stock offerings and convertible offerings. (3) Includes non convertible preferred stock, mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and taxable municipal debt. Includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues. 61 Table of Contents 2004 versus 2003. Net revenues in Investment Banking of $3.37 billion for 2004 increased 24% compared with 2003. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $1.74 billion increased 45% compared with 2003, primarily reflecting a significant increase in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our Underwriting business of $1.64 billion increased 8% compared with 2003, reflecting a significant increase in industry wide public common stock offerings and industry wide initial public offerings. The increase in Investment Banking net revenues primarily reflects higher levels of activity in the industrial and consumer sectors. Our investment banking backlog at the end of 2004 was higher than the end of 2003. (1) Operating expenses were $2.97 billion in 2004, 19% higher than 2003, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. These increases were partially offset by lower occupancy expenses, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space, and reduced amortization of identifiable intangible assets, as 2003 included impairment charges in respect of certain distribution rights. Depreciation and amortization expenses were also lower. Pre tax earnings of $401 million in 2004 increased 94% compared with 2003. 2003 versus 2002. Net revenues in Investment Banking of $2.71 billion for 2003 decreased 4% compared with 2002. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $1.20 billion decreased 20% compared with 2002, primarily reflecting a decline in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our Underwriting business of $1.51 billion increased 13% compared with 2002, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide debt new issuance activity. Equity Underwriting net revenues decreased compared with 2002, primarily reflecting a decline in industry wide total equity underwriting volume, including initial public offerings, partially offset by higher net revenues from convertible issuances. The reduction in Investment Banking net revenues reflects lower levels of activity in the industrial and financial institutions sectors, partially offset by increased activity in the healthcare and natural resources sectors. Our investment banking backlog at the end of 2003 was slightly higher than at the end of 2002. (1) Operating expenses were $2.50 billion in 2003, 2% higher than 2002, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, with higher discretionary compensation more than offsetting the impact of lower levels of employment. The increase in discretionary compensation in Investment Banking reflected, among other factors, the overall performance of Goldman Sachs, continued strong relative performance in the business (as evidenced by our high rankings and market share), as well as the somewhat improved business environment at the end of 2003. Operating expenses also increased due to intangible asset impairment charges in respect of certain distribution rights, higher professional fees, reflecting increased legal fees, and increased occupancy expenses, primarily related to exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space. These expense increases were partially offset by lower other expenses, market development expenses and communications and technology expenses, reflecting the impact of reduced employment levels, lower levels of business activity and continued cost containment discipline. Pre tax earnings of $207 million in 2003 decreased 45% compared with 2002. Trading and Principal Investments Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into three components: FICC. We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products, mortgage backed securities and loans, currencies and commodities, structure and enter into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. Equities. We make markets in, act as a specialist for, and trade equities and equity related products, structure and enter into equity derivative transactions, and engage in proprietary (1) Our investment banking backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. 62 Table of Contents trading. We also execute and clear customer transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Principal Investments. Principal Investments primarily represents net revenues from our merchant banking investments, including the increased share of the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on a funds investments exceeds certain threshold returns (merchant banking overrides), as well as unrealized gains or losses from our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG. Substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily and, therefore, its value and our net revenues are subject to fluctuations based on market movements. In addition, net revenues derived from our principal investments in privately held concerns and in real estate may fluctuate significantly depending on the revaluation or sale of these investments in any given period. We also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses. The number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period. Net revenues from Principal Investments do not include management fees generated from our merchant banking funds. These management fees are included in the net revenues of the Asset Management and Securities Services segment. The following table sets forth the operating results of our Trading and Principal Investments segment: Trading and Principal Investments Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 FICC $ 7,322 $ 5,596 $ 4,680 Equities trading 1,969 1,738 1,008 Equities commissions 2,704 2,543 2,994 Total Equities 4,673 4,281 4,002 SMFG 771 293 Gross gains 855 593 572 Gross losses (399 ) (437 ) (801 ) Net other corporate and real estate investments 456 156 (229 ) Overrides 105 117 194 Total Principal Investments 1,332 566 (35 ) Total net revenues 13,327 10,443 8,647 Operating expenses 8,287 6,938 6,505 Pre tax earnings $ 5,040 $ 3,505 $ 2,142 2004 versus 2003. Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments of $13.33 billion for 2004 increased 28% compared with 2003. Net revenues in FICC of $7.32 billion increased 31% compared with 2003, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in credit products and commodities, as well as improved performances in currencies and mortgages. In addition, net revenues in interest rate products were strong, but were lower compared with 2003. During 2004, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity, rising energy prices, narrow corporate credit spreads and low, although rising, interest rates. The yield curve remained steep in 2004, but flattened in the second half of the year. Net revenues in Equities of $4.67 billion increased 9% compared with 2003, reflecting higher net revenues in our global 63 Table of Contents equities products group, primarily due to increased activity in shares and derivatives. In addition, net revenues were higher in our principal strategies business. During 2004, Equities operated in an environment characterized by improved customer driven activity, particularly early in the year, and generally higher equity prices. However, volatility levels continued to decline during 2004. Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $1.33 billion, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG of $771 million (net of unrealized foreign exchange losses on the Japanese yen denominated borrowing funding this investment), as well as gains and overrides from other corporate principal investments. Operating expenses were $8.29 billion in 2004, 19% higher than 2003, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. Other expenses also increased, principally due to the acquisition of consolidated entities held for investment purposes and increased levels of business activity. In addition, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees were higher, reflecting higher transaction volumes in certain of our businesses, professional fees increased, primarily due to higher consulting and legal fees, and market development expenses increased, primarily due to higher levels of business activity. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of identifiable intangible assets, as 2003 included impairment charges in respect of option specialist rights. In addition, occupancy expenses decreased, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space, and depreciation and amortization expenses were lower. Pre tax earnings of $5.04 billion in 2004 increased 44% compared with 2003. 2003 versus 2002. Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments of $10.44 billion for 2003 increased 21% compared with 2002. FICC net revenues of $5.60 billion increased 20% compared with 2002, primarily due to higher net revenues in credit products, as well as improved performances in interest rate products and commodities, partially offset by lower net revenues in currencies, which performed particularly well in 2002. During 2003, FICC operated in a generally favorable environment characterized by tightening corporate credit spreads, low interest rates, a steep yield curve and strong customer demand. Equities net revenues of $4.28 billion increased 7% compared with 2002, primarily due to higher net revenues in principal strategies. This increase was partially offset by lower net revenues in our global equities products group, primarily reflecting lower commission volumes and clearance and execution fees in our U.S. shares business. Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $566 million, which included an unrealized gain related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG of $293 million (net of unrealized foreign exchange losses on the Japanese yen denominated borrowing funding this investment), and gains and overrides from real estate and other corporate principal investments. Operating expenses were $6.94 billion in 2003, 7% higher than 2002, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, with higher discretionary compensation (reflecting increased net revenues) more than offsetting the impact of lower levels of employment. Operating expenses also increased due to intangible asset impairment charges in respect of option specialist rights, higher other expenses, and increased occupancy expenses, primarily related to exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space. These expense increases were partially offset by lower communications and technology expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, and market development expenses, reflecting the impact of reduced employment levels, lower levels of business activity and continued cost containment discipline. Pre tax earnings of $3.51 billion in 2003 increased 64% compared with 2002. 64 Table of Contents Asset Management and Securities Services Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided into two components: Asset Management. Asset Management provides investment advisory and financial planning services to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees. Securities Services. Securities Services provides prime brokerage, financing services and securities lending services to mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, foundations and high net worth individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees. The following table sets forth the operating results of our Asset Management and Securities Services segment: Asset Management and Securities Services Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2004 2003 2002 Asset Management $ 2,553 $ 1,853 $ 1,653 Securities Services 1,296 1,005 856 Total net revenues 3,849 2,858 2,509 Operating expenses 2,430 1,890 1,562 Pre tax earnings $ 1,419 $ 968 $ 947 Assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage of asset value or based on investment performance. Assets under management include our mutual funds, alternative investment funds, separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors and our merchant banking funds. Substantially all assets under management are valued as of calendar month end. The following table sets forth our assets under management by asset class: Assets Under Management by Asset Class (in billions) As of November 30 2004 2003 (3) 2002 Money markets $ 90 $ 89 $ 108 Fixed income and currency 139 115 96 Equity (1) 126 98 86 Alternative investments (2) 97 71 58 Total $ 452 $ 373 $ 348 (1) Includes both our fundamental equity and quantitative equity strategies.

(2) Includes $16 billion in non money market net asset outflows resulting from British Coal Pension Schemes planned program of diversification among its asset managers. 2004 versus 2003. Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services of $3.85 billion for 2004 increased 35% compared with 2003. Asset Management net revenues of $2.55 billion increased 38% compared with 2003, primarily due to higher average assets under management, significantly higher incentive fees and a full year contribution from Ayco. During 2004, assets under management increased 21% to $452 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $52 billion, across all asset classes, as well as market appreciation of $27 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets. Securities Services net revenues of $1.30 billion increased 29% compared with 2003, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending. Operating expenses were $2.43 billion, 29% higher than 2003, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. In addition, other expenses increased, principally due to higher levels of business activity, including increased Asset Management distribution costs. Professional fees were also higher, primarily reflecting increased legal and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and occupancy expenses, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space. Pre tax earnings of $1.42 billion increased 47% compared with 2003. 2003 versus 2002. Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services of $2.86 billion for 2003 increased 14% compared with 2002. Asset Management net revenues of $1.85 billion increased 12% compared with 2002, primarily reflecting an increase in average assets under management, the contribution from Ayco and increased incentive income. During 2003, assets under management increased 7% to $373 billion, reflecting market appreciation of $29 billion in equity, fixed income and alternative investment assets. Net asset outflows for 2003 were $4 billion, primarily reflecting net outflows in money market assets, partially offset by net inflows in fixed income and alternative investment assets. Net asset outflows for 2003 included $16 billion in net outflows related to British Coal Pension Schemes planned program of diversification among its asset managers and $4 billion in inflows acquired from Ayco. Securities Services net revenues of 66 Table of Contents $1.01 billion for 2003 increased 17% compared with 2002, primarily reflecting higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending. Operating expenses were $1.89 billion in 2003, 21% higher than 2002, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation. Operating expenses also increased as a result of our combination with Ayco and higher occupancy expenses, primarily related to exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space. In addition, other expenses were higher, principally due to increased Asset Management distribution costs, and professional fees increased, primarily reflecting higher legal fees. Pre tax earnings of $968 million in 2003 increased 2% compared with 2002. Geographic Data For a summary of the net revenues, pre tax earnings and identifiable assets of Goldman Sachs by geographic region, see Note 15 in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K to the consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and asset backed securitization vehicles; holding senior and subordinated debt, limited and general partnership interests, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives; entering into operating leases; and providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit, representations and warranties. We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, primarily related to the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages and home equity loans, government and corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets. Other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions; providing secondary market liquidity; making investments in performing and nonperforming debt, real estate and other assets; providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes; and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process. Variable interest entities (VIEs) and qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage backed and asset backed securities markets, since they provide market liquidity to financial assets by offering investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Our financial interests in, and derivative transactions with, nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value, in the same manner as our other financial instruments, except in cases where we exert significant influence over an entity and apply the equity method of accounting. 67 Table of Contents The following table sets forth where a discussion of these and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in Part II, Items 7 and 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K: Type of Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Disclosure in Annual Report on Form 10 K Retained interests or contingent interests in assets transferred by us to nonconsolidated entities See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of variable interests we have in nonconsolidated entities See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Derivative contracts See Critical Accounting Policies included above and Risk Management included below and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Nonderivative guarantees See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Leases, letters of credit, and loans and other commitments See Capital and Funding included below and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of our consolidation policies. Capital and Funding Capital The amount of capital we hold is principally determined by subsidiary capital requirements, regulatory and rating agency guidelines, and our overall risk profile, which is largely driven by the size and composition of our trading and investment positions. Goldman Sachs total capital (shareholders equity and long term borrowings) increased 34% to $105.78 billion as of November 2004 compared with $79.11 billion as of November 2003. See Risk Management Liquidity Risk Cash Flows included below, for a discussion of how we deployed capital raised as part of our financing activities. The increase in total capital resulted primarily from an increase in long term borrowings to $80.70 billion as of November 2004 from $57.48 billion as of November 2003. The weighted average maturity of our long term borrowings as of November 2004 was approximately 7 years. We swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into U.S. dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our long term borrowings. Over the past several years, our ratio of long term borrowings to shareholders equity has been increasing. The growth in our long term borrowings has been driven primarily by (i) the need to increase total capital in response to opportunities in our trading and investing businesses and (ii) in light of the favorable debt financing environment, our ability to replace a portion of our short term borrowings with long term borrowings and pre fund near term refinancing requirements. 68 Table of Contents Shareholders equity increased by 16% to $25.08 billion as of November 2004 from $21.63 billion as of November 2003. During 2004, we repurchased 18.7 million shares of our common stock. In addition, to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements related to the delivery of shares underlying restricted stock units, we cancelled 9.1 million restricted stock units at an average price of $95.20 per unit in 2004. Our repurchase program is intended to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee equity based compensation and to help maintain our shareholders equity at appropriate levels. The repurchase program has been effected primarily through regular open market purchases, the sizes of which have been and will continue to be influenced by, among other factors, prevailing prices and market conditions. The average price paid per share for repurchased shares was $96.29 and $76.83 for the years ended November 2004 and November 2003, respectively. As of November 2004, we were authorized to repurchase up to 6.4 million additional shares of stock pursuant to our repurchase program. On January 25, 2005, the Board of Directors of Goldman Sachs authorized the repurchase of an additional 40.0 million shares of common stock. For additional information on our repurchase program, see Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following table sets forth information on our assets, shareholders equity, leverage ratios and book value per share: As of November 2004 2003 ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Total assets $ 531,379 $ 403,799 Adjusted assets (1) 347,082 273,941 Shareholders equity 25,079 21,632 Tangible shareholders equity (2) 20,208 16,650 Tangible equity capital (2) 22,958 16,650 Leverage ratio (3) 21.2 x 18.7 x Adjusted leverage ratio (4) 15.1 x 16.5 x Debt to equity ratio (5) 3.2 x 2.7 x Book value per share (6) $ 50.77 $ 43.60 Tangible book value per share (7) 40.91 33.56 (1) Adjusted assets excludes (i) low risk collateralized assets generally associated with our matched book and securities lending businesses (which we calculate by adding our securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and then subtracting our nonderivative short positions), (ii) cash and securities we segregate in compliance with regulations and (iii) goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. 69 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total assets to adjusted assets: As of November 2004 2003 (in millions) Total assets $ 531,379 $ 403,799 Deduct: Securities purchased under agreements to resell (44,257 ) (26,856 ) Securities borrowed (155,086 ) (129,118 ) Add: Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value 132,097 102,699 Less derivatives (64,001 ) (41,886 ) Subtotal 68,096 60,813 Deduct: Cash and securities segregated in compliance with U.S. federal and other regulations (48,179 ) (29,715 ) Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (4,871 ) (4,982 ) Adjusted assets $ 347,082 $ 273,941 (2) Tangible shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Tangible equity capital includes tangible shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to a trust. We consider junior subordinated debt issued to a trust to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to the inherent characteristics of these securities, including the long term nature of the securities, our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of the obligations in our capital structure. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of shareholders equity to tangible shareholders equity and tangible equity capital: As of November 2004 2003 (in millions) Shareholders equity $ 25,079 $ 21,632 Deduct: Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (4,871 ) (4,982 ) Tangible shareholders equity $ 20,208 $ 16,650 Add: Junior subordinated debt issued to a trust 2,750 Tangible equity capital $ 22,958 $ 16,650 (3) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by shareholders equity. (4) Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital. We believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses. (5) Debt to equity ratio equals long term borrowings divided by shareholders equity. (6) Book value per share is based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 494.0 million as of November 2004 and 496.1 million as of November 2003. (7) Tangible book value per share is computed by dividing tangible shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements. Short Term Borrowings Goldman Sachs obtains secured and unsecured short term borrowings primarily through issuance of promissory notes, commercial paper and bank loans. Short term borrowings also include the portion of long term borrowings maturing within one year and certain long term borrowings that may be redeemable within one year at the option of the holder. 70 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our short term borrowings by product: Short Term Borrowings (in millions) As of November 2004 2003 Promissory notes $ 19,513 $ 24,119 Commercial paper 4,355 4,767 Bank loans and other 13,474 8,183 Current portion of long term borrowings 17,617 7,133 Total $ 54,959 $ 44,202 Our liquidity depends to an important degree on our ability to refinance these borrowings on a continuous basis. Investors who hold our outstanding promissory notes (short term unsecured debt that is nontransferable and in which Goldman Sachs does not make a market) and commercial paper have no obligation to purchase new instruments when the outstanding instruments mature. The following table sets forth our secured and unsecured short term borrowings: As of November 2004 2003 (in millions) Secured short term borrowings $ 8,558 $ 3,321 Unsecured short term borrowings 46,401 40,881 Total short term borrowings $ 54,959 $ 44,202 Our secured short term borrowings provide Goldman Sachs with a more stable source of liquidity, as these borrowings are less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than our unsecured short term borrowings, due to the underlying collateral. See Risk Management Liquidity Risk included below for a discussion of the principal liquidity policies we have in place to manage the liquidity risk associated with our short term borrowings. For a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to access these and other markets, see Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business included above. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our short term borrowings. Credit Ratings We rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions, including OTC derivatives. We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity, market and credit risk management practices, the level and variability of our earnings, our franchise, reputation and management, our capital base, our corporate governance and the external operating environment. See Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business included above for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings. 71 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings as of November 2004: Short Term Debt Long Term Debt Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited R 1 (middle) A (high) Fitch, Inc. F1 AA Moodys Investors Service P 1 Aa3 Standard Poors A 1 A As of November 2004, collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately $379 million could have been required in the event of a one level reduction in our long term credit ratings. In evaluating our liquidity requirements, we consider additional collateral or termination payments that could be required in the event of further reductions in our long term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. For a further discussion of our excess liquidity policies, see Risk Management Liquidity Risk Excess Liquidity Maintenance of a Pool of Highly Liquid Securities included below. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments Goldman Sachs has contractual obligations to make future payments under long term debt and long term noncancelable lease agreements and has contingent commitments under a variety of commercial arrangements. The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of November 2004: Contractual Obligations (in millions) 2006 2008 2010 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter Total Long term borrowings by contract maturity (1)(2) $ $ 21,371 $ 20,982 $ 38,343 $ 80,696 Minimum rental payments 359 676 600 1,884 3,519 (1) Long term borrowings maturing within one year and certain long term borrowings that may be redeemable within one year at the option of the holder are included as short term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition. (2) Long term borrowings repayable at the option of Goldman Sachs are reflected at their contractual maturity dates. Certain long term borrowings that may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are reflected at the dates such options become exercisable. 72 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our quarterly long term borrowings maturity profile through fiscal year 2010: Long Term Borrowings Maturity Profile Fiscal Years 2006 through 2010 ($ in millions) As of November 2004, our long term borrowings were $80.70 billion and consisted principally of senior borrowings with maturities extending to 2034. These long term borrowings consisted of $12.09 billion in secured long term borrowings and $68.61 billion in unsecured long term borrowings. As of November 2004, long term borrowings included nonrecourse debt of $12.05 billion, consisting of $5.14 billion issued by William Street Funding Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Group Inc. formed to raise funding to support loan commitments to investment grade clients made by another wholly owned William Street entity), $978 million issued by our consolidated power plant operations and $5.93 billion issued by other consolidated entities. Nonrecourse debt is debt that Group Inc. is not directly or indirectly obligated to repay. See Note 3 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding VIEs and our long term borrowings, respectively. As of November 2004, our future minimum rental payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, under noncancelable leases were $3.52 billion. These lease commitments, principally for office space, expire on various dates through 2029. Certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges. Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future. We continually evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels. In 2004, we reduced our global office space and incurred exit costs of $41 million (included in occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses). We may incur additional exit costs in 2005 and thereafter to the extent we (i) further reduce our capacity or (ii) commit to new properties in the locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. Such exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period. 73 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our contingent commitments as of November 2004: Contingent Commitments (in millions) Commitment Amount by Period of Expiration 2006 2008 2010 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter Total Commitments to extend credit $ 10,746 $ 5,245 $ 7,845 $ 3,880 $ 27,716 Commitments under letters of credit issued by banks to counterparties 11,102 40 9 11,151 Other commercial commitments (1) 554 395 6 432 1,387 Total $ 22,402 $ 5,680 $ 7,851 $ 4,321 $ 40,254 (1) Includes our corporate and real estate investment fund commitments, construction related obligations and other purchase commitments. Our commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to counterparties that have fixed termination dates and are contingent on all conditions to borrowing set forth in the contract having been met. Since these commitments may expire unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements. As of November 2004, $9.40 billion of our outstanding commitments to extend credit have been issued through the William Street credit extension program. Substantially all of the credit risk associated with these commitments has been covered by credit loss protection provided by SMFG. We have also hedged the credit risk of certain non William Street commitments using a variety of other financial instruments. As of November 2004, we had commitments to enter into forward secured financing transactions, including certain repurchase and resale agreements and secured borrowing and lending arrangements, of $48.32 billion. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our commitments, contingencies and guarantees. Regulated Subsidiaries Many of our principal subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Goldman, Sachs Co. and Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P. (1) are registered U.S. broker dealers and futures commissions merchants, and their primary regulators include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Chicago Board of Trade, the NYSE, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the National Futures Association. Goldman Sachs International, a registered U.K. broker dealer, is subject to regulation primarily by the Financial Services Authority. Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., a Tokyo based broker dealer, is subject to regulation by the Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange, The Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange and the Japan Securities Dealers Association. Several other subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs are regulated by securities, investment advisory, banking, and other regulators and authorities around the world, such as the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank in Germany, the Autorit des Marchs Financiers and Banque de France in France, Banca dItalia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Societ e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our regulated subsidiaries. For a (1) Group Inc. renamed Spear, Leeds Kellogg, L.P., Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P., effective January 14, 2005. 74 Table of Contents discussion of our potential inability to access funds from our regulated entities, see Risk Management Liquidity Risk Intercompany Funding included below. The Financial Groups Directive (Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council) introduced certain changes to the way in which financial conglomerates and other financial services organizations operating in Europe will be regulated, with the changes to be implemented by member states for fiscal years beginning in 2005. These changes will cause activities that are currently conducted in unregulated entities to become subject to certain forms of regulation, including consolidated supervision and capital adequacy requirements. Our efforts to comply with the directive involve applying to be subject to the consolidated supervised entity rules described below. The SEC has adopted rule amendments that establish alternative net capital requirements for broker dealers that are part of a consolidated supervised entity. As a condition to its use of the alternative method, a broker dealers ultimate holding company and affiliates (referred to collectively as a consolidated supervised entity or CSE) must consent to group wide supervision and examination by the SEC. Goldman, Sachs Co. anticipates applying for permission to use this alternative method. We expect that doing so will enable us to comply with the requirements of the Financial Groups Directive described above. On becoming subject to the SECs group wide supervision, Goldman Sachs will be required to report to the SEC computations of our capital adequacy. Risk Management Management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities. These risks include market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational exposures. Risk Management Structure Goldman Sachs seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and legal reporting systems. In addition, a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process. These committees, whose responsibilities are described below, meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units. Management Committee. All risk control functions ultimately report to our Management Committee. Through both direct and delegated authority, the Management Committee approves all of our operating activities, trading risk parameters and customer review guidelines. Risk Committees. The Firmwide Risk Committee reviews the activities of existing businesses, approves new businesses and products, approves firmwide and divisional market risk limits, reviews business unit market risk limits, approves market risk limits for selected emerging markets and business units, approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group, and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements. The Divisional Risk Committee sets market risk limits, subject to overall firmwide risk limits, for both FICC and Equities based on a number of measures, including Value at Risk (VaR) and scenario analyses. In our asset management business, the Control Oversight Committee, the Investment Policy Group and the Valuation Committee oversee various operational, credit, valuation and business practice issues. Business Practices Committee. The Business Practices Committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance and operational risks and related reputational concerns. The committee also reviews the firms policies, practices and procedures for consistency with our 75 Table of Contents business principles. The committee makes recommendations for improvements in these areas so as to mitigate potential risks and to assist in enhancing adherence to our business principles. Capital Committee. The Capital Committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital. Such capital commitments include extensions of credit, alternative liquidity commitments, certain bond underwritings, certain distressed debt and principal finance activities and certain equity linked structured products. The Capital Committee is also responsible for ensuring that business and reputational standards for capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. Commitments Committee. The Commitments Committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, the Commitments Committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. Credit Policy Committee. The Credit Policy Committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the Credit Department. Finance Committee. The Finance Committee establishes and ensures compliance with our liquidity policies, sets certain inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk, the size and composition of our balance sheet, our capital base and our credit ratings. The Finance Committee regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events, risks and exposures. Operational Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies, framework and methodologies, and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management. Structured Products Committee. The Structured Products Committee reviews and approves structured product transactions with our clients that raise legal, regulatory, tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to Goldman Sachs. Segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process. In addition to the committees described above, departments that are independent of the revenue producing units, such as Compliance, Finance, Legal, Management Controls (Internal Audit) and Operations, in part perform risk management functions, which include monitoring, analyzing and evaluating risk. Business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks. Trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their individual markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. Market risk limits are monitored on a daily basis by the Finance Division, and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee. Limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and the appropriate business unit managers. Selected business unit inventory position limits are also monitored by the Finance Division and position limit violations are reported to the appropriate business unit managers and the Finance Committee. Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk. Such positions result from market making, specialist and proprietary trading, investing and underwriting activities. 76 Table of Contents Categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. A description of each market risk category is set forth below: Interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads. Equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices. Currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates. Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and precious and base metals. We seek to manage these risks through diversifying exposures, controlling position sizes and establishing hedges in related securities or derivatives. For example, we may hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract. The ability to manage an exposure may, however, be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument. In addition to applying business judgment, senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk. These tools include: risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as VaR; scenario analyses, stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events, including, but not limited to, a large widening of credit spreads, a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets; and inventory position limits for selected business units. VaR VaR is the potential loss in value of Goldman Sachs trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For the VaR numbers reported below, a one day time horizon and a 95% confidence level were used. This means that there is a 1 in 20 chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported VaR. Thus, shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported VaR would be anticipated to occur, on average, about once a month. Shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported VaR by significant amounts. Shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days. The VaR numbers below are shown separately for interest rate, equity, currency and commodity products, as well as for our overall trading positions. The VaR numbers in each risk category include the underlying product positions and related hedges that may include positions in other product areas. For example, the hedge of a foreign exchange forward may include an interest rate futures position, and the hedge of a long corporate bond position may include a short position in the related equity. The modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and 77 Table of Contents approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. We use historical data to estimate our VaR and, to better reflect current asset volatilities, we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations. Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Different VaR methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different VaR. Moreover, VaR calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day. Changes in VaR between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of exposure, volatilities and or correlations among asset classes. The following tables set forth the daily trading VaR: Average Daily VaR (1)(2) (in millions) Year Ended November Risk Categories 2004 2003 2002 Interest rates $ 36 $ 38 $ 34 Equity prices 32 27 22 Currency rates 20 18 16 Commodity prices 20 18 12 Diversification effect (3) (41 ) (43 ) (38 ) Firmwide $ 67 $ 58 $ 46 (1) During the fourth quarter of 2003, we made certain changes to our model for calculating VaR. The effect of these changes was not material and, accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted. (2) During the second quarter of 2004, we began to exclude from our calculation distressed asset portfolios in FICC that cannot be properly measured in VaR. The effect of excluding these portfolios was not material to prior periods and, accordingly, such periods have not been adjusted. For a further discussion of the market risk associated with these portfolios, see Distressed Asset Portfolios below. (3) Equals the difference between firmwide VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Our average daily VaR increased to $67 million in 2004 from $58 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices, partially offset by reduced exposures to interest rates, as well as reduced volatilities, particularly in interest rate and equity assets. The increase in average daily VaR to $58 million in 2003 from $46 million in 2002 was due to higher levels of exposure in all product categories, partially offset by reduced volatilities, particularly in equity assets. 78 Table of Contents Daily VaR (1) (in millions) Year Ended As of November November 2004 Risk Categories 2004 2003 High Low Interest rates $ 28 $ 35 $ 64 $ 24 Equity prices 25 33 45 18 Currency rates 18 24 31 6 Commodity prices 35 11 36 11 Diversification effect (2) (40 ) (40 ) Firmwide $ 66 $ 63 88 49 (1) During the second quarter of 2004, we began to exclude from our calculation distressed asset portfolios in FICC that cannot be properly measured in VaR. The effect of excluding these portfolios was not material to prior periods and, accordingly, such periods have not been adjusted. For a further discussion of the market risk associated with these portfolios, see Distressed Asset Portfolios below. (2) Equals the difference between firmwide VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Our daily VaR increased to $66 million as of November 2004 from $63 million as of November 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to commodity prices, partially offset by reduced exposure to currency rates and equity prices, as well as reduced volatilities, particularly in interest rate and equity assets. The following chart presents our daily trading VaR during 2004: Daily VaR ($ in millions) 79 Table of Contents Trading Net Revenues Distribution Substantially all of our inventory positions are marked to market on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues. The following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in VaR for the year ended November 2004: Daily Trading Net Revenues ($ in millions) As part of our overall risk control process, daily trading net revenues are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our 95% one day VaR on one occasion during 2004. Distressed Asset Portfolios The market risk associated with distressed asset portfolios in FICC that cannot be properly measured in VaR (primarily due to inadequate historical data on the underlying assets in the aggregate) is measured based on a potential 10% decline in the asset value of such portfolios. The market values of the underlying distressed asset positions are sensitive to changes in a number of factors, including discount rates and the projected timing and amount of future cash flows. As of November 2004, the potential impact of a 10% decline in the asset value of these portfolios was $416 million compared with $228 million as of November 2003. Nontrading Risk SMFG. The market risk of our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a 10% decline in the SMFG common stock price. As of November 2004, the sensitivity of our investment to a 10% decline in the SMFG common stock price was $236 million compared with $75 million as of November 2003. The change is primarily due to an increase in the SMFG common stock price and the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock. This sensitivity should not be extrapolated to other movements in the SMFG common stock price, as the relationship between the fair value of our investment and the SMFG common stock price is nonlinear. 80 Table of Contents Other Principal Investments. The market risk for financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio, including our merchant banking investments but excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a 10% decline in equity markets. This sensitivity analysis is based on certain assumptions regarding the relationship between changes in stock price indices and changes in the fair value of the individual financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio. Different assumptions could produce materially different risk estimates. As of November 2004, the sensitivity of our nontrading portfolio (excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG) to a 10% equity market decline was $118 million compared with $104 million as of November 2003, primarily reflecting an increase in the carrying value of our public principal investments. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us. To reduce our credit exposures, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. In addition, we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events, by seeking third party guarantees of the counterpartys obligations, and through the use of credit derivatives and other structures and techniques. For most businesses, counterparty credit limits are established by the Credit Department, which is independent of the revenue producing departments, based on guidelines set by the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Credit Policy Committee. For most products, we measure and limit credit exposures by reference to both current and potential exposure. We typically measure potential exposure based on projected worst case market movements over the life of a transaction within a 95% confidence interval. For collateralized transactions, we also evaluate potential exposure over a shorter collection period, and give effect to the value of collateral received. We further seek to measure credit exposure through the use of scenario analyses, stress tests and other quantitative tools. Our global credit management systems monitor current and potential credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates. The systems also provide management, including the Firmwide Risk and Credit Policy Committees, with information regarding overall credit risk by product, industry sector, country and region. As of both November 2004 and November 2003, we held U.S. government and federal agency obligations that represented 5% and 6% of our total assets, respectively. In addition, most of our securities purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized by U.S. government, federal agency and other sovereign obligations. As of November 2004 and November 2003, we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded 5% of our total assets. However, over the past several years, the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing, due to, among other factors, the growth of our lending and OTC derivatives activities. A further discussion of our derivative activities follows below. Derivatives Derivative contracts are instruments, such as futures, forwards, swaps or option contracts, which derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as OTC derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange. Substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes, in order to facilitate customer transactions, to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management. In addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes, we enter into derivative contracts 81 Table of Contents to hedge our net investment in non U.S. operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings. Derivatives are used in many of our businesses, and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to the underlying assets or risks being hedged, or as part of a broader trading strategy. Accordingly, the market risk of derivative positions is managed with all of our other nonderivative market risk. Fair values of our derivative contracts reflect cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. For an OTC derivative, our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract. The following table sets forth the distribution, by credit rating, of substantially all of our exposure with respect to OTC derivatives as of November 2004, after taking into consideration the effect of netting agreements. The categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents.

Derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including, among other risks, that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty, that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty. We attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction. Liquidity Risk Liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector. Most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events. Our principal objective is to be able to fund Goldman Sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenue even under adverse circumstances. Management has implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework: Excess Liquidity maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment including financing obligations. Asset Liability Management ensure we fund our assets with the appropriate financing. Intercompany Funding maintain parent company liquidity and manage the distribution of liquidity across the group structure. Crisis Planning ensure all funding and liquidity management is based on stress scenario planning and feeds into our liquidity crisis plan. 83 Table of Contents Excess Liquidity Maintenance of a Pool of Highly Liquid Securities. Our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity. This Global Core Excess liquidity is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets. We believe that this pre funded pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment. Our Global Core Excess reflects the following principles: Focus must be maintained on all potential cash outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Goldman Sachs businesses are diverse, and its cash needs are driven by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that the firms liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our unsecured liabilities. The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a companys survival. The loan value (the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities) of our Global Core Excess averaged $41.99 billion in 2004 and $38.46 billion in 2003. The following table sets forth the average loan value of our Global Core Excess: Year Ended November 2004 2003 (in millions) U.S. dollar denominated $ 33,858 $ 32,223 Non U.S. dollar denominated 8,135 6,234 Total Global Core Excess $ 41,993 $ 38,457 The U.S. dollar denominated excess includes only overnight cash deposits and unencumbered U.S. government and agency securities and highly liquid mortgage securities, all of which are Federal Reserve repo eligible. Our non U.S. dollar denominated excess includes only unencumbered French, German, United Kingdom and Japanese government bonds and non U.S. dollar overnight cash deposits. We strictly limit our Global Core Excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash which we believe are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. The majority of our Global Core Excess is structured such that it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and all of its subsidiaries. The remainder is held in our principal non U.S. operating entities, primarily to better match the currency and timing requirements for those entities potential liquidity obligations. The size of our Global Core Excess is determined by an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of Goldman Sachs. Our liquidity 84 Table of Contents model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis, including, but not limited to: upcoming maturities of unsecured debt; potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt; adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding; derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows due to market moves or increased requirements; additional collateral that could be called in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings; draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by William Street Funding Corporation (1); and upcoming cash outflows, such as tax and other large payments. Other Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our Global Core Excess described above, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities. These assets, which are located in the United States, Europe and Asia, include other government bonds, high grade money market securities, corporate bonds and marginable equities. We do not include these securities in our Global Core Excess. We maintain Global Core Excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that, if pledged or sold, would provide the funds necessary to replace at least 110% of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature (or where holders have the option to redeem) within the next twelve months. This implies that we could fund our positions on a secured basis for one year in the event we were unable to issue new unsecured debt or liquidate assets. We assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we review these assumptions asset by asset at least annually. The estimated aggregate loan value of our Global Core Excess and our other unencumbered assets averaged $100.51 billion in 2004 and $76.42 billion in 2003. Asset Liability Management Asset Quality and Balance Sheet Composition. We seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily. Our balance sheet fluctuates significantly between financial statement dates and is lower at fiscal period end than would be observed on an average basis. We require certain of our businesses to reduce balance sheet usage on a quarterly basis to demonstrate compliance with limits set by management, thereby providing a disincentive to committing our capital over longer periods of time. These balance sheet reductions are generally achieved during the last several weeks of each fiscal quarter through ordinary course, open market transactions in the most liquid portions of our balance sheet, principally U.S. government and agency securities, securities of foreign sovereigns, and mortgage and money market instruments, as well as through the roll off of repurchase agreements and certain collateralized financing arrangements. Accordingly, over the last six quarters, our total assets and adjusted assets at quarter end have been, on average, 17% lower and 16% lower, respectively, than amounts that would have been observed, based on a weekly average, over that period. These differences, however, have not resulted in material changes to our credit risk, market risk or liquidity position because they are generally in highly liquid assets that are typically financed on a secured basis. Certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress and, accordingly, we generally hold higher levels of capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments. (1) The Global Core Excess excludes liquid assets held separately to support the William Street credit extension program. 85 Table of Contents The table below sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments: As of November 2004 2003 (in millions) Mortgage whole loans and collateralized debt obligations (1) $ 18,346 $ 11,768 Bank loans (2) 8,900 6,706 High yield securities 6,057 4,817 Emerging market debt securities 1,653 1,247 SMFG convertible preferred stock 2,556 1,683 Other corporate principal investments (3) 1,278 1,273 Real estate principal investments (3) 820 799 (1) Includes certain retained interests held in QSPEs. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our securitization activities. (2) Includes both funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our trading and lending activities. (3) Excludes assets of $1.28 billion and $1.07 billion in consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds as of November 2004 and November 2003, respectively. A large proportion of these assets are continually funded on a secured basis through normal secured funding markets and nonrecourse funding. We focus on developing capacity for funding these assets on a term secured basis in order to ensure that these assets maintain a certain amount of loan value in periods of market stress. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold. Appropriate Financing of Asset Base. We seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due, even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress. We generally do not rely on immediate sales of assets (other than our Global Core Excess) to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment. However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity crisis. In order to avoid reliance on asset sales, we ensure that we have sufficient total capital (long term borrowings plus shareholders equity) to fund our balance sheet for at least one year. We therefore seek to maintain total capital in excess of the aggregate of the following long term financing requirements: the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress, assuming conservative loan values; goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, property, leasehold improvements and equipment, and other illiquid assets; derivatives and other margin and collateral requirements; anticipated draws on our unfunded commitments; and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that is in excess of their long term financing requirements. See Intercompany Funding included below for further discussion on how we fund our subsidiaries. Our total capital of $105.78 billion and $79.11 billion as of November 2004 and November 2003, respectively, exceeded the aggregate of these requirements. 86 Table of Contents Conservative Liability Structure. We structure our liabilities conservatively to minimize refinancing and buy back risk. For example, we emphasize the use of promissory notes over commercial paper in order to improve the stability of our short term unsecured financing base. We have also created internal guidelines regarding the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any single week or year and have average maturity targets for our unsecured debt programs. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding. We have imposed various internal guidelines, including the amount of our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors. We benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own sales force to a large, diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. We access funding in a variety of markets in the United States, Europe and Asia. We issue debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and 144A medium term notes programs, offshore medium term notes offerings and other bond offerings, U.S. and non U.S. commercial paper and promissory note issuances, and other methods. We make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets and arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf. Additionally, senior unsecured debt issued by Group Inc. does not contain provisions that would, based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or our stock price, trigger a requirement for an early payment, collateral support, changes in terms, acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation. Intercompany Funding Subsidiary Funding Policies. Substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company, Group Inc. The parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing and capital requirements. In addition, the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this strategy include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Our intercompany funding policies are predicated on our assumption that, unless legally provided for, funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries. As such, we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries. In addition, we assume that the Global Core Excess held in our principal non U.S. operating entities will not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on obligations, including debt obligations. Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries; for example, as of November 2004, Group Inc. had $16.21 billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in Goldman, Sachs Co., its principal U.S. regulated broker dealer, $12.14 billion invested in Goldman Sachs International, a registered U.K. broker dealer, $2.55 billion invested in Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P.(1), a U.S. regulated broker dealer, and $2.07 billion invested in Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., a Tokyo based broker dealer. Group Inc. also had $46.84 billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of November 2004, as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. (1) Group Inc. renamed Spear, Leeds Kellogg, L.P., Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P., effective January 14, 2005. 87 Table of Contents We also manage our intercompany exposure by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company. This policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent companys third party borrowings. In addition, many of our subsidiaries and affiliates pledge collateral at loan value to the parent company to cover their intercompany borrowings (other than subordinated debt) in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk. Equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with parent company equity capital. As of November 2004, Group Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was $23.67 billion compared with its shareholders equity of $25.08 billion. Subsidiary Foreign Exchange Policies. Our capital invested in non U.S. subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is hedged. Currency translation adjustment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income decreased to $5 million for 2004 compared with $128 million for 2003, primarily due to an expansion of our policy for hedging our net investment in non U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, we generally hedge the nontrading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entitys functional currency. Crisis Planning In order to be prepared for a liquidity event, or a period of market stress, we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario planning. In addition, we maintain a Liquidity Crisis Plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event. The Plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on Goldman Sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on the severity of the event. It also lists the crisis management team and internal and external parties to be contacted to ensure effective distribution of information. Cash Flows As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and, consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our business. Year Ended November 2004. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.72 billion to $4.37 billion at the end of 2004. We raised $31.75 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily in long term debt, in light of the favorable debt financing environment. We used net cash of $34.47 billion in our operating and investing activities, primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for ourselves and our clients, to meet additional collateral requirements at securities exchanges and clearing organizations and to provide additional funding support for our William Street loan commitments program. Year Ended November 2003. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $2.27 billion to $7.09 billion at the end of 2003. We raised $20.58 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily in long term debt.

Operational Risk Operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes, people or systems, and from external events. Operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from more or less routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents arising, for example, from major systems failures. Operational risk may also entail reputational harm. Thus, efforts to identify, manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss. We manage operational risk through the application of long standing, but continuously evolving, firmwide control standards; the training, supervision and development of our people; the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks at both the business unit level and for the firm as a whole; and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor quantitative and qualitative indicators of operational risk. Together, these elements comprise a strong firmwide control culture that is at the center of our efforts aimed at minimizing operational shortcomings and the damage they can cause. The Operational Risk Department is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the design, implementation and maintenance of our overall operational risk management framework. This framework, which evolves with the changing needs of business complexities and regulatory guidance, takes into account internal and external operational risk events, business unit specific risk assessments, the ongoing analysis of business specific risk metrics and the use of scenario analysis. While the direct responsibility for the control and mitigation of operational risk lies with the individual business units, this framework provides a consistent methodology for identifying and monitoring operational risk factors for both individual business unit managers and senior management. 89 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Developments In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 R. FIN No. 46 R replaced FIN No. 46, which was issued in January 2003. As permitted, we adopted either FIN No. 46 or FIN No. 46 R for substantially all VIEs in which we held a variable interest as of November 2003. As of May 2004, we adopted FIN No. 46 R for all VIEs in which we held a variable interest. The effect of our adoption of FIN No. 46 and FIN No. 46 R was not material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003) amends the disclosure requirements for pension plans and other postretirement benefits by requiring additional disclosures such as descriptions of the types of plan assets, investment strategies, measurement dates, plan obligations, cash flows and components of net periodic pension costs recognized during interim periods. The statement does not change the measurement or recognition of plan assets and obligations. We adopted the interim period disclosures beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2004. As required, we adopted the annual disclosure provisions effective for our fiscal year ending November 2004. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our employee benefit plans. In May 2004, the FASB issued the FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which supersedes FSP No. FAS 106 1 of the same title issued in January 2004. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act) introduces a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Management has concluded that, if provisions are finalized in their current form, benefits provided under our plan meet the actuarially equivalent standard set forth in the Medicare Act. As permitted, we prospectively adopted FSP No. FAS 106 2 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, thereby reducing our accumulated benefit obligation by $13 million. The impact on net periodic postretirement benefit cost in future periods is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123 R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123 R focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for employee services and generally establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains goods or services in share based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123 R is effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We are currently evaluating the effect of adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, but do not expect adoption to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 90 Table of Contents
