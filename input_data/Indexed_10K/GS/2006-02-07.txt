Our activities are divided into three segments: Investment Banking. We provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Trading and Principal Investments. We facilitate client transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals and take proprietary positions through market making in, trading of and investing in fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities and derivatives on such products. In addition, we engage in specialist and market making activities on equities and options exchanges and we clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and other investing activities, we make principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage. Asset Management and Securities Services. We provide investment advisory and financial planning services and offer investment products across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide, and provide prime brokerage services, financing services and securities lending services to mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, foundations and high net worth individuals worldwide. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all references to 2005, 2004 and 2003 refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, November 25, 2005, November 26, 2004 and November 28, 2003, respectively. When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, we, us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to the Annual Report on Form 10 K are to our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005. In this discussion, we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. These statements relate to our future plans and objectives, among other things. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the results indicated in these forward looking statements. Important factors, among others, that could cause our results to differ, possibly materially, from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed below under Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10 K and Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 47 Table of Contents Executive Overview Our diluted earnings per common share were $11.21 for 2005, a 26% increase compared with 2004. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity was 27.6% (1) and return on average common shareholders equity was 21.8%. Our results in 2005 reflected strong growth in net revenues from Trading and Principal Investments and Asset Management and Securities Services as well as higher net revenues in Investment Banking. The increase in Trading and Principal Investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC), as all major businesses performed well. During 2005, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity, tight, but volatile, credit spreads, higher energy prices and a flatter yield curve. Net revenues in Equities also improved significantly compared with the prior year, reflecting strong performance across the business. Equities operated in an environment characterized by generally higher equity prices, improved customer driven activity and continued low levels of market volatility. Net revenues in our Principal Investments business also increased significantly, primarily reflecting a gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) as well as gains from real estate principal investments. The strong net revenue growth in Asset Management and Securities Services primarily reflected higher assets under management and higher customer balances in Securities Services. The increase in Investment Banking net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting and improved results in Financial Advisory, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity, partially offset by lower net revenues in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog at the end of 2005 was significantly higher than at the end of 2004. (2) Our operating results for 2005 reflected generally favorable market conditions and strong customer driven activity levels. We continued to see favorable trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves, particularly during the second half of our fiscal year. Consequently, during the second half of 2005 we increased our market risk, particularly in equities and interest rate products, to capitalize on these opportunities. Net revenues in our Equities and FICC businesses surpassed previous peak levels. Our Investment Banking net revenues reflected our best performance in four years as corporate activity continued to recover, particularly in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions and debt underwriting, although competitive pressures remained. We also continued to focus on managing our capital base, with the goal of optimizing our returns while, at the same time, growing our businesses. During 2005, we repurchased 63.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $7.11 billion. With respect to the regulatory environment, financial services firms continued to be under intense scrutiny, with the volume and amount of claims against financial institutions and other related costs remaining significant. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses can be expected to remain high. Though our operating results were strong in 2005, our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable earnings. Our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally. For a further discussion of these trends and other factors affecting our businesses, see Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business below as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. (1) Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity. See Results of Operations Financial Overview below for further information regarding our calculation of return on average tangible common shareholders equity. (2) Our investment banking backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. 48 Table of Contents Business Environment As an investment banking, securities and investment management firm, our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by low inflation, low or declining interest rates, and strong equity markets. Over the business cycle, these factors provide a positive climate for our investment banking activities, for many of our trading businesses and for wealth creation, which contributes to growth in our asset management business. Although short term interest rates, particularly in the United States, continued to rise and the yield curve continued to flatten, economic conditions remained generally favorable during 2005, as global interest rates remained at historically low levels, core inflation was broadly contained, global equity prices generally rose and corporate activity continued to improve. For a further discussion of how market conditions can affect our businesses, see " Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business below as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. A further discussion of the business environment in 2005 is set forth below. Global. After strong growth in 2004, the global economy remained solid in 2005, despite a brief period of weakness during our fiscal second quarter. Worldwide real gross domestic product growth for the calendar year, although lower than the prior year, was slightly above the average of the past 20 years. Energy prices rose significantly during the first nine months of our fiscal year, peaking at the beginning of our fourth quarter, but the sharp increase did not appear to have a significant impact on global growth. In addition, the U.S. economy performed well and the Japanese economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, particularly in the first half of the calendar year. The U.S. Federal Reserve continued to raise rates in 2005, increasing its federal funds rate target by a total of 200 basis points during our fiscal year. Despite the increase in U.S. short term rates, fixed income markets generally performed well, as long term bond yields remained generally low and corporate credit spreads remained generally tight. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the major currencies, although it weakened against a number of emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Chinese yuan and Korean won. Global equity markets generally rose during the year, with significant increases in many markets around the world. Corporate activity continued to improve during the year. Although equity and equity related volumes were essentially unchanged from 2004, debt underwriting volumes improved and industry wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly. United States. The U.S. economy grew at a strong pace during the year. Real gross domestic product rose by approximately 3.5% in the 2005 calendar year, driven principally by continued strength in the housing market and consumer spending. Despite hurricane related disruptions, consumer spending reached its highest rate of growth during the third calendar quarter. After slowing modestly in the first quarter of 2005, the rate of inflation increased, particularly in the third quarter, as energy prices rose significantly. However, measures of core inflation remained broadly contained. In response to the improving environment and rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its federal funds rate target by 25 basis points in each of its meetings, bringing the rate to 4.00% by the end of our fiscal year. Despite the sharp rise in short term interest rates, the 10 year U.S. Treasury note yield ended the year only 19 basis points higher. Although the U.S. dollar generally strengthened throughout the year, financial conditions remained generally supportive of economic activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, SP 500 Index and NASDAQ Composite Index increased by 4%, 7% and 8%, respectively, during our fiscal year. Europe. The pace of economic growth in Europe remained slow as real gross domestic product in the Eurozone economies grew by approximately 1.5% in the 2005 calendar year. Economic conditions in the Eurozone economies softened in the first half of the year as business sentiment deteriorated and energy prices rose. However, conditions improved modestly later in the year as continued strength in the global economy and the weakening of the euro supported higher growth in exports and investment spending. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged through our fiscal year. In the U.K., real gross domestic product growth appeared to slow 49 Table of Contents sharply, declining to approximately 1.8% in the 2005 calendar year, reflecting softer growth in consumption and investment spending. The Bank of England reduced interest rates by 25 basis points and long term bond yields in both the Eurozone and the U.K. ended the year lower. Despite the modest economic growth, the FTSE 100 Index increased by 16% and continental European equity markets also increased significantly during our fiscal year. Asia. Japans economy grew at its strongest pace since 2000, with real gross domestic product growing by over 2% for the second consecutive calendar year. The recovery in domestic demand and private investment drove much of the improvement, while exports improved in the second half of the calendar year. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in 2005 from 4.7% in 2004. The Bank of Japan continued to provide substantial liquidity to the market and continued to hold short term interest rates at zero percent through the year and long term bond yields ended the year slightly lower. With short term interest rates rising in the U.S., the yen weakened and financial conditions remained generally supportive of economic activity. The Nikkei 225 Index increased 36% during our fiscal year. Elsewhere in Asia, Chinas real gross domestic product growth remained robust, with growth particularly reliant on higher net exports, as demonstrated by Chinas large current account surplus. Chinas modest currency revaluation in July did not result in further significant exchange rate developments in the region. Growth in India remained very strong, which, together with China, supported growth throughout the region. Equity markets across the region generally rose, with markets in South Korea and India posting significant gains during our fiscal year. Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks. For a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks, see Risk Management below. A summary of the more important factors that could affect our business follows below. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Market Conditions and Market Risk. Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally and these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability in many ways, including the following: We have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years. Increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid, may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses. We have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading, specialist and investing positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions, including, but not limited to, our interest rate and credit products, currency, commodity and equity positions and our merchant banking investments, or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions. From time to time, we have incurred significant trading losses in periods of market turbulence. Conversely, certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses. Industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our revenues and, because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly, our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions, a 50 Table of Contents decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our investment banking business. Pricing and other competitive pressures have continued, even as the volume and number of investment banking transactions have increased. In addition, the trend in the underwriting business toward multiple book runners and co managers handling transactions, where previously there would have been a single book runner, may adversely affect our business and reduce our revenues. Reductions in the level of the equity markets also tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios, which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets. Even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions, investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors could result in a decline in assets under management and in the incentive and management fees we receive. Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making, proprietary trading and investing, block trading, merchant banking, underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer driven business. For example, large blocks of securities are increasingly being sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis, which increases the risk that Goldman Sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities at favorable prices and may incur significant losses as a result. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry. We also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses. The number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period. The volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and as a specialist or market maker may decline, which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In addition, competitive pressures and other industry factors, including the increasing use by our clients of low cost electronic trading, could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. In our specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in a declining market. This may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity. Weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. In addition, competitive pressures have been particularly intense in the context of block trades. For a further discussion of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, see Critical Accounting Policies Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets below. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses. Liquidity Risk. Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we are unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time. 51 Table of Contents Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements. For a discussion of the potential impact on Goldman Sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings, see Capital and Funding Credit Ratings below. Credit Risk. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years, as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposures. The scope of our lending businesses has also been expanding and includes loans to small and mid size businesses, which are not traditional Goldman Sachs clients. As a clearing member firm, we finance our client positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. In addition, we have experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take. In particular, corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs. Operational Risk. Shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, or external events could lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial loss, disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. For example, our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. The transactions we process have become increasingly complex and often must adhere to client specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by Goldman Sachs or third parties with which we conduct business. Legal and Regulatory Risk. We are subject to extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the world. Substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against Goldman Sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. For a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures, see Use of Estimates below. 52 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Fair Value The use of fair value to measure our financial instruments, with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations, is fundamental to our financial statements and is our most critical accounting policy. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. In determining fair value, we separate our financial instruments into three categories cash (i.e., nonderivative) trading instruments, derivative contracts and principal investments, as set forth in the following table: Financial Instruments by Category (in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Financial Financial Financial Instruments Sold, Financial Instruments Sold, Instruments But Not Yet Instruments But Not Yet Owned, At Purchased, At Owned, At Purchased, At Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Cash trading instruments $ 210,042 $ 89,735 $ 143,376 $ 68,096 Derivative contracts 58,532 57,829 62,495 64,001 Principal investments 6,526 (1) 1,507 (2) 4,654 (1) Total $ 275,100 $ 149,071 $ 210,525 $ 132,097 (1) Excludes assets for which Goldman Sachs is not at risk (e.g., assets related to consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds) of $1.93 billion and $1.28 billion as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. (2) Represents an economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG. For a further discussion of our investment in SMFG, see Principal Investments below. 53 Table of Contents Cash Trading Instruments. The following table sets forth the valuation of our cash trading instruments by level of price transparency: Cash Trading Instruments by Price Transparency (in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Financial Financial Financial Instruments Sold, Financial Instruments Sold, Instruments But Not Yet Instruments But Not Yet Owned, At Purchased, At Owned, At Purchased, At Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Fair Value Quoted prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable price transparency $ 198,233 $ 89,565 $ 130,908 $ 67,948 Little or no price transparency 11,809 170 12,468 148 Total $ 210,042 $ 89,735 $ 143,376 $ 68,096 Fair values of our cash trading instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, broker or dealer price quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The types of instruments valued in this manner include U.S. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, liquid mortgage products, investment grade corporate bonds, listed equities, money market securities, state, municipal and provincial obligations, and physical commodities. Certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and have little or no price transparency. Such instruments may include certain high yield debt, corporate bank loans, mortgage whole loans and distressed debt. We value these instruments initially at cost and generally do not adjust valuations unless there is substantive evidence supporting a change in the value of the underlying instrument or valuation assumptions (such as similar market transactions, changes in financial ratios or changes in the credit ratings of the underlying companies). Where there is evidence supporting a change in the value, we use valuation methodologies such as the present value of known or estimated cash flows. Cash trading instruments we own (long positions) are marked to bid prices and instruments we have sold but not yet purchased (short positions) are marked to offer prices. If liquidating a position is expected to affect its prevailing market price, our valuation is adjusted generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies. In certain circumstances, such as for highly illiquid positions, managements estimates are used to determine this adjustment. 54 Table of Contents Derivative Contracts. Derivative contracts consist of exchange traded and over the counter (OTC) derivatives. The following table sets forth the fair value of our exchange traded and OTC derivative assets and liabilities: Derivative Assets and Liabilities (in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Exchange traded derivatives $ 10,869 $ 9,083 $ 5,464 $ 5,905 OTC derivatives 47,663 48,746 57,031 58,096 Total $ 58,532 (1) $ 57,829 (2) $ 62,495 (1) $ 64,001 (2) (1) Net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of $22.61 billion and $18.65 billion as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. (2) Net of cash paid pursuant to credit support agreements of $16.10 billion and $5.45 billion as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. Fair values of our exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices. OTC derivatives are valued using valuation models. We use a variety of valuation models including the present value of known or estimated cash flows and option pricing models. The valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our OTC derivatives require inputs including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. The selection of a model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Where possible, we verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available. For OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, model selection requires more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in these markets. Price transparency is inherently more limited for more complex structures because they often combine one or more product types, requiring additional inputs such as correlations and volatilities. As markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available, we continue to review and refine the models that we use. At the inception of an OTC derivative contract (day one), we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. These adjustments are generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies. In certain circumstances, such as for highly illiquid positions, managements estimates are used to determine these adjustments. Where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions, we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and, consequently, record no day one gain or loss in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Following day one, we adjust the inputs to our valuation models only to the extent that changes in these inputs can be verified by similar market transactions, third party pricing services and or broker quotes, or can be derived from other substantive evidence such as empirical market data. In circumstances where we cannot verify the model to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. 55 Table of Contents The following tables set forth the fair values of our OTC derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity: OTC Derivatives (in millions) As of November 2005 Assets 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,898 $ 467 $ 4,634 $ 5,310 $ 5,221 $ 17,530 Currencies 5,825 1,031 1,843 919 1,046 10,664 Commodities 3,772 1,369 8,130 1,374 120 14,765 Equities 1,168 1,171 832 1,403 130 4,704 Total $ 12,663 $ 4,038 $ 15,439 $ 9,006 $ 6,517 $ 47,663 Liabilities 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,956 $ 590 $ 5,327 $ 3,142 $ 4,970 $ 15,985 Currencies 6,295 575 3,978 436 924 12,208 Commodities 3,852 2,080 5,904 1,865 162 13,863 Equities 1,308 1,068 2,079 1,993 242 6,690 Total $ 13,411 $ 4,313 $ 17,288 $ 7,436 $ 6,298 $ 48,746 As of November 2004 Assets 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,475 $ 451 $ 5,682 $ 4,250 $ 12,743 $ 24,601 Currencies 9,570 1,499 3,670 2,320 1,198 18,257 Commodities 2,943 1,164 5,581 1,108 160 10,956 Equities 1,311 813 457 634 2 3,217 Total $ 15,299 $ 3,927 $ 15,390 $ 8,312 $ 14,103 $ 57,031 Liabilities 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total Interest rates $ 1,854 $ 789 $ 7,366 $ 7,136 $ 5,658 $ 22,803 Currencies 9,577 1,580 4,456 2,755 1,184 19,552 Commodities 3,791 1,425 4,522 814 107 10,659 Equities 1,409 1,304 1,114 1,084 171 5,082 Total $ 16,631 $ 5,098 $ 17,458 $ 11,789 $ 7,120 $ 58,096 We enter into certain OTC option transactions that provide us or our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the underlying contract. The fair value of these option contracts is not material to the aggregate fair value of our OTC derivative portfolio. In the tables above, for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument, the remaining contractual maturity is generally classified based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument. In those instances where the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash, the remaining contractual maturity is generally based upon the option expiration date. 56 Table of Contents Principal Investments. In valuing our corporate and real estate principal investments, we separate our portfolio into investments in private companies, investments in public companies (excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG) and our investment in SMFG. The following table sets forth the carrying value of our principal investments portfolio: Principal Investments (in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Corporate Real Estate Total Corporate Real Estate Total Private $ 1,538 $ 716 $ 2,254 $ 935 $ 769 $ 1,704 Public 185 29 214 343 51 394 Subtotal (1) 1,723 745 2,468 1,278 820 2,098 SMFG convertible preferredstock (2) 4,058 4,058 (3) 2,556 2,556 Total $ 5,781 $ 745 $ 6,526 $ 3,834 $ 820 $ 4,654 (1) Excludes assets for which Goldman Sachs is not at risk (e.g., assets related to consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds) of $1.93 billion and $1.28 billion as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. (2) The fair value of our Japanese yen denominated investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation. We hedge our economic exposure to exchange rate movements on our investment in SMFG by borrowing Japanese yen. Foreign exchange revaluation on the investment and the related borrowing are generally equal and offsetting. For example, if the Japanese yen appreciates against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar carrying value of our SMFG investment will increase and the U.S. dollar carrying value of the related borrowing will also increase by an amount that is generally equal and offsetting. (3) Excludes an economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG. As of November 25, 2005, the fair value of this hedge was $1.51 billion and is reflected in Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For a further discussion of the restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell the common stock underlying our investment in SMFG, see below. Our private principal investments, by their nature, have little or no price transparency. Such investments are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value. Downward adjustments are also made, in the absence of third party transactions, if we determine that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value. In reaching that determination, we consider many factors including, but not limited to, the operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies or properties relative to budgets or projections, trends within sectors and or regions, underlying business models, expected exit timing and strategy, and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment, such as conversion features and liquidation preferences. Our public principal investments, which tend to be large, concentrated holdings that result from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions, are valued using quoted market prices discounted based on predetermined written policies for nontransferability and illiquidity. Our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG is carried at fair value, which is derived from a model that incorporates SMFGs common stock price and credit spreads, the impact of nontransferability and illiquidity, and the downside protection on the conversion strike price. The fair value of our investment is particularly sensitive to movements in the SMFG common stock price. As a result of transfer restrictions and the downside protection on the conversion strike price, the relationship between changes in the fair value of our investment and changes in SMFGs common 57 Table of Contents stock price is nonlinear. During our fiscal year, the fair value of our investment (excluding the economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying one third of our investment) increased 85% (expressed in Japanese yen), primarily due to an increase in the SMFG common stock price and, to a lesser extent, the impact of passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock. Our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG is generally nontransferable, but is freely convertible into SMFG common stock. Restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell one third of the common stock underlying our investment in SMFG lapsed in February 2005. As of November 2005, we were fully hedged with respect to these unrestricted shares. Under our initial agreement with SMFG, restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell the remaining shares of common stock underlying our investment in SMFG lapse in equal installments on February 7, 2006 and February 7, 2007. In connection with a public offering by SMFG of its common stock, we have separately agreed with SMFG that the restrictions that were to lapse on February 7, 2006 will instead lapse on March 9, 2006. Effective February 1, 2006, the conversion price of our SMFG preferred stock into shares of SMFG common stock is 320,900. This price is subject to downward adjustment if the price of SMFG common stock at the time of conversion is less than the conversion price (subject to a floor of 105,800). Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. A control infrastructure, independent of the trading and investing functions, is fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important in valuing instruments with lower levels of price transparency. We employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties. Senior management, independent of the trading functions, is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies to our Audit Committee. We seek to maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control functions are performed to the highest standards. We employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets, price verification, review of daily profit and loss, and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets. These procedures are performed by personnel independent of the revenue producing units. For trading and principal investments with little or no price transparency, we employ, where possible, procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions, analysis of actual to projected cash flows, comparisons with subsequent sales and discussions with senior business leaders. For a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses, see Risk Management below. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets As a result of our acquisitions, principally SLK LLC (SLK) in fiscal 2000, The Ayco Company, L.P. (Ayco) in fiscal 2003, Cogentrix Energy, Inc. (Cogentrix) in fiscal 2004 and National Energy Gas Transmission, Inc. (NEGT) in fiscal 2005, we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. Goodwill. We test the goodwill in each of our operating segments for impairment at least annually in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value. We derive the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples. We derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the assets of each operating segment. Our last annual impairment test was performed during our fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and no impairment was identified. 58 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment: Goodwill by Operating Segment (in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Investment Banking Financial Advisory $ $ Underwriting 125 125 Trading and Principal Investments FICC 91 135 Equities (1) 2,390 2,382 Principal Investments 1 Asset Management and Securities Services Asset Management (2) 424 423 Securities Services 117 117 Total $ 3,148 $ 3,182 (1) Primarily related to SLK. (2) Primarily related to Ayco. Identifiable Intangible Assets. We amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in accordance with SFAS No. 142, and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the carrying value and range of remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class: Identifiable Intangible Assets by Asset Class ($ in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Range of Remaining Carrying Useful Lives Carrying Value (in years) Value Customer lists (1) $ 777 6 20 $ 828 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) specialist rights 580 22 24 607 Power contracts (2) 481 2 31 Exchange traded fund (ETF) and option specialist rights 111 22 121 Other (3) 106 2 9 133 Total $ 2,055 $ 1,689 (1) Primarily includes our clearance and execution and NASDAQ customer lists related to SLK and financial counseling customer lists related to Ayco. (2) Primarily relates to above market power contracts of consolidated power generation facilities related to Cogentrix and NEGT. We closed on our acquisition of NEGT and recorded purchase price allocation adjustments for NEGT and Cogentrix in fiscal 2005. Substantially all of these power contracts have been pledged as collateral to counterparties in connection with certain of our secured short term and long term borrowings. (3) Primarily includes technology related assets related to SLK. A prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets. In addition, certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets, including (i) changes in market structure that could adversely affect our specialist businesses, (ii) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or (iii) a default event under a power contract or physical damage or other adverse events impacting the underlying power generation facilities. Use of Estimates The use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits. We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters, particularly in cases or proceedings in which 60 Table of Contents substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K, for information on our judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings. Results of Operations The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. For a further discussion of the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations, see Business Environment and Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business above, and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Financial Overview The following table sets forth an overview of our financial results: Financial Overview ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Net revenues $ 24,782 $ 20,550 $ 16,012 Pre tax earnings 8,273 6,676 4,445 Net earnings 5,626 4,553 3,005 Net earnings applicable to common shareholders 5,609 4,553 3,005 Diluted earnings per common share 11.21 8.92 5.87 Return on average common shareholders equity (1) 21.8 % 19.8 % 15.0 % Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (2) 27.6 % 25.2 % 19.9 % (1) Return on average common shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders equity. (2) Tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock and goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a meaningful measure of performance because it excludes the portion of our common shareholders equity attributable to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. As a result, this calculation measures corporate performance in a manner that treats underlying businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of average total shareholders equity to average tangible common shareholders equity: Average for the Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Total shareholders equity $ 26,264 $ 22,975 $ 20,031 Deduct: Preferred stock (538 ) Common shareholders equity $ 25,726 $ 22,975 $ 20,031 Deduct: Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (5,418 ) (4,918 ) (4,932 ) Tangible common shareholders equity $ 20,308 $ 18,057 $ 15,099 61 Table of Contents Net Revenues 2005 versus 2004. Our net revenues were $24.78 billion in 2005, an increase of 21% compared with 2004, reflecting strong growth in Trading and Principal Investments and Asset Management and Securities Services as well as higher net revenues in Investment Banking. The increase in Trading and Principal Investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in FICC, as all major businesses performed well. During 2005, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity, tight, but volatile, credit spreads, higher energy prices and a flatter yield curve. Net revenues in Equities also improved significantly compared with the prior year, reflecting strong performance across the business. Equities operated in an environment characterized by generally higher equity prices, improved customer driven activity and continued low levels of market volatility. Net revenues in our Principal Investments business also increased significantly, primarily reflecting a gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG as well as gains from real estate principal investments. The strong net revenue growth in Asset Management and Securities Services primarily reflected higher assets under management and higher customer balances in Securities Services. The increase in Investment Banking net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting and improved results in Financial Advisory, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity, partially offset by lower net revenues in equity underwriting. 2004 versus 2003. Our net revenues were $20.55 billion in 2004, an increase of 28% compared with 2003, reflecting strong growth in Trading and Principal Investments, Asset Management and Securities Services, and Investment Banking. The increase in Trading and Principal Investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in FICC, as all major businesses and regions performed well in a generally favorable environment. Net revenues in our Principal Investments business also increased significantly, due to an unrealized gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, as well as gains from other corporate principal investments. In addition, Equities net revenues improved, primarily reflecting higher customer driven activity and favorable market conditions early in 2004. Equities operated in a less favorable environment after our first fiscal quarter of 2004, as volatility levels continued to decline and markets generally lacked direction before moving higher in the last several weeks of our fiscal year. Asset Management and Securities Services generated strong revenue growth, primarily reflecting higher assets under management, increased incentive fees and significantly higher customer balances in Securities Services. In Investment Banking, net revenues also increased, highlighted by strong growth in both our Financial Advisory and equity underwriting businesses, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity. 62 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. A substantial portion of our compensation expense represents discretionary bonuses, with our overall compensation and benefits expenses generally targeted at 50% (plus or minus a few percentage points) of consolidated net revenues. In addition to the level of net revenues, our compensation expense in any given year is influenced by, among other factors, prevailing labor markets, business mix and the structure of our equity based compensation programs. The following table sets forth our operating expenses and number of employees: Operating Expenses and Employees ($ in millions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Compensation and benefits (1) (2) (3) $ 11,688 $ 9,652 $ 7,515 Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees 1,109 952 829 Market development 378 374 264 Communications and technology 490 461 478 Depreciation and amortization 501 499 562 Amortization of identifiable intangible assets 124 125 319 Occupancy 728 646 722 Professional fees 475 338 253 Other expenses 1,016 827 625 Total non compensation expenses 4,821 4,222 4,052 Total operating expenses $ 16,509 $ 13,874 $ 11,567 Employees at year end (2) (3) 22,425 20,722 19,476 (1) Includes the amortization of employee initial public offering and acquisition awards of $19 million, $61 million and $122 million for the years ended November 2005, November 2004 and November 2003, respectively. (2) Excludes 1,437, 1,206 and 1,228 employees as of November 2005, November 2004 and November 2003, respectively, of Goldman Sachs consolidated property management and loan servicing subsidiaries. Compensation and benefits includes $182 million, $164 million and $134 million for the years ended November 2005, November 2004 and November 2003, respectively, attributable to these subsidiaries, the majority of which is reimbursed to Goldman Sachs by the investment funds for which these subsidiaries manage properties and perform loan servicing. Such reimbursements are recorded in net revenues. (3) Excludes 7,143, 293 and 279 employees as of November 2005, November 2004 and November 2003, respectively, of consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Compensation and benefits includes $128 million, $11 million and $3 million for the years ended November 2005, November 2004 and November 2003, respectively, attributable to these consolidated entities. Consolidated entities held for investment purposes includes entities that are held strictly for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are engaged in activities that are not closely related to our principal businesses. 63 Table of Contents The following table sets forth non compensation expenses of consolidated entities held for investment purposes and our remaining non compensation expenses by line item: Non Compensation Expenses (in millions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Non compensation expenses of consolidated investments (1) $ 265 $ 21 $ 7 Non compensation expenses excluding consolidated investments Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees 1,109 952 829 Market development 361 374 264 Communications and technology 487 461 478 Depreciation and amortization 467 499 562 Amortization of identifiable intangible assets 124 125 319 Occupancy 674 646 722 Professional fees 468 338 253 Other expenses 866 806 618 Subtotal 4,556 4,201 4,045 Total non compensation expenses, as reported $ 4,821 $ 4,222 $ 4,052 (1) Consolidated entities held for investment purposes includes entities that are held strictly for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are engaged in activities that are not closely related to our principal businesses. For example, these investments include consolidated entities that hold real estate assets such as golf courses and hotels in Asia, but exclude investments in entities that primarily hold financial assets. We believe that it is meaningful to review non compensation expenses excluding expenses related to these consolidated entities in order to evaluate trends in non compensation expenses related to our principal business activities. Revenues related to such entities are included in Trading and principal investments in the consolidated statements of earnings. 2005 versus 2004. Operating expenses were $16.51 billion for 2005, 19% above 2004. Compensation and benefits expenses of $11.69 billion increased 21% compared with 2004, resulting from higher discretionary compensation, reflecting higher net revenues, and increased levels of employment. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2005 was 47.2% compared with 46.7% (2) for 2004. Employment levels increased 8% compared with November 2004. Non compensation expenses of $4.82 billion for 2005 increased 14% compared with 2004. Excluding non compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes, non compensation expenses were 8% higher than 2004, primarily due to higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, reflecting higher transaction volumes in FICC and Equities, increased professional fees, reflecting higher legal and consulting fees, and higher other expenses, primarily reflecting increased levels of business activity and higher charitable contributions. Non compensation expenses in 2005 included $37 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings (included in other expenses) and $36 million of real estate costs associated with the relocation of office space (included in occupancy). Non compensation expenses in 2004 included $103 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, $62 million in connection with the establishment of our joint venture in China (included in market development) and $41 million of real estate exit costs associated with reductions in our office space (included in occupancy and depreciation and amortization). (2) For the year ended November 2004, including the amortization of employee initial public offering and acquisition awards of $61 million, the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 47.0%. 64 Table of Contents 2004 versus 2003. Operating expenses were $13.87 billion for 2004, 20% above 2003. Compensation and benefits expenses of $9.65 billion increased 28% compared with 2003, due to higher discretionary compensation, reflecting higher net revenues, and increased employment levels. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2004 was 46.7% compared with 46.2% for 2003. (1) Employment levels increased 6% compared with November 2003. Non compensation expenses of $4.22 billion for 2004 increased 4% compared with 2003. Other expenses included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $103 million for 2004 compared with $159 million for 2003. Excluding these provisions, other expenses increased $258 million, primarily due to the acquisition of consolidated investments, increased levels of business activity and higher charitable contributions. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased, reflecting higher transaction volumes in certain of our businesses, and market development expenses were higher, primarily reflecting $62 million in connection with the establishment of our joint venture in China, as well as higher levels of business activity. In addition, professional fees were higher, primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by decreased amortization of identifiable intangible assets (2003 included impairment charges of $188 million, primarily in respect of option specialist rights) as well as lower occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses. Total exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space (included in occupancy and depreciation and amortization) were $41 million for 2004 compared with $153 million for 2003. Provision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2005 was 32.0% compared with 31.8% for 2004. Excluding the impact of audit settlements in 2005, the effective income tax rate for 2005 would have been 33.3%. (2) Excluding the impact of audit settlements, the increase in the effective income tax rate for 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to a lower benefit from tax credits in 2005. The effective income tax rate for 2004 was 31.8%, down from 32.4% for 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for 2004 as compared with 2003 reflected lower state and local taxes and the effect of audit settlements. Our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings, the level of our tax credits and the effect of tax audits. Certain of these and other factors, including our history of pre tax earnings, are taken into account in assessing our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our provision for taxes. (1) For the years ended November 2004 and November 2003, including the amortization of employee initial public offering and acquisition awards of $61 million and $122 million, respectively, the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 47.0% and 46.9%, respectively. (2) The effective income tax rate excluding the impact of audit settlements is calculated by dividing the provision for taxes, adjusted to exclude the impact of audit settlements, by pre tax earnings. The impact of audit settlements decreased the effective income tax rate by 1.3% for 2005. We believe that the effective income tax rate excluding the impact of audit settlements provides a meaningful basis for period to period comparisons of our effective income tax rates. 65 Table of Contents Segment Operating Results The following table sets forth the net revenues, operating expenses and pre tax earnings of our segments: Segment Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Investment Banking Net revenues $ 3,671 $ 3,374 $ 2,711 Operating expenses 3,258 2,973 2,504 Pre tax earnings $ 413 $ 401 $ 207 Trading and Principal Investments Net revenues $ 16,362 $ 13,327 $ 10,443 Operating expenses 10,144 8,287 6,938 Pre tax earnings $ 6,218 $ 5,040 $ 3,505 Asset Management and Securities Services Net revenues $ 4,749 $ 3,849 $ 2,858 Operating expenses 3,070 2,430 1,890 Pre tax earnings $ 1,679 $ 1,419 $ 968 Total Net revenues $ 24,782 $ 20,550 $ 16,012 Operating expenses (1) 16,509 13,874 11,567 Pre tax earnings $ 8,273 $ 6,676 $ 4,445 (1) Includes the following expenses that have not been allocated to our segments: (i) the amortization of employee initial public offering awards, net of forfeitures, of $19 million and $80 million for the years ended November 2004 and November 2003, respectively; (ii) net provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings of $37 million, $103 million and $155 million for the years ended November 2005, November 2004 and November 2003, respectively; and (iii) $62 million in connection with the establishment of our joint venture in China for the year ended November 2004. Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and interest expense to specific securities, commodities and other positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such underlying positions. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our segments. The cost drivers of Goldman Sachs taken as a whole compensation, headcount and levels of business activity are broadly similar in each of our business segments. Compensation expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of Goldman Sachs as well as the performance of individual business units. Consequently, pre tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A discussion of segment operating results follows. 66 Table of Contents Investment Banking Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components: Financial Advisory. Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin offs. Underwriting. Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of equity, equity related and debt instruments. The following table sets forth the operating results of our Investment Banking segment: Investment Banking Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Financial Advisory $ 1,905 $ 1,737 $ 1,202 Equity underwriting 704 819 678 Debt underwriting 1,062 818 831 Total Underwriting 1,766 1,637 1,509 Total net revenues 3,671 3,374 2,711 Operating expenses 3,258 2,973 2,504 Pre tax earnings $ 413 $ 401 $ 207 The following table sets forth our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Banking Volumes (1) (in billions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Announced mergers and acquisitions $ 865 $ 403 $ 414 Completed mergers and acquisitions 599 502 355 Equity and equity related offerings (2) 47 52 40 Debt offerings (3) 260 236 250 (1) Source: Thomson Financial. Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity related offerings and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. (2) Includes public common stock offerings and convertible offerings. (3) Includes non convertible preferred stock, mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and taxable municipal debt. Includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues. 2005 versus 2004. Net revenues in Investment Banking of $3.67 billion for 2005 increased 9% compared with 2004. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $1.91 billion increased 10% compared with 2004, primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our Underwriting business of $1.77 billion increased 8% compared with 2004, reflecting higher net revenues in debt underwriting, primarily due to an increase in leveraged finance and mortgage activity, partially offset by lower net revenues in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog at the end of 2005 was significantly higher than at the end of 2004. (4) (4) Our investment banking backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. 67 Table of Contents Operating expenses of $3.26 billion for 2005 increased 10% compared with 2004, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher levels of discretionary compensation and increased amortization expense related to prior year equity awards. In addition, other expenses increased principally due to higher levels of business activity, and professional fees were higher driven by increased legal and consulting fees. Pre tax earnings of $413 million in 2005 increased 3% compared with 2004. 2004 versus 2003. Net revenues in Investment Banking of $3.37 billion for 2004 increased 24% compared with 2003. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $1.74 billion increased 45% compared with 2003, primarily reflecting a significant increase in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in our Underwriting business of $1.64 billion increased 8% compared with 2003, reflecting a significant increase in industry wide public common stock offerings and industry wide initial public offerings. The increase in Investment Banking net revenues primarily reflects higher levels of activity in the industrial and consumer sectors. Our investment banking backlog at the end of 2004 was higher than at the end of 2003. (1) Operating expenses of $2.97 billion for 2004 increased 19% compared with 2003, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. These increases were partially offset by lower occupancy expenses, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space, and reduced amortization of identifiable intangible assets, as 2003 included impairment charges in respect of certain distribution rights. Depreciation and amortization expenses were also lower. Pre tax earnings of $401 million in 2004 increased 94% compared with 2003. Trading and Principal Investments Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into three components: FICC. We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products, mortgage backed securities and loans, currencies, and commodities, structure and enter into a wide variety of derivative transactions and engage in proprietary trading and investing. Equities. We make markets in, trade and act as a specialist for equities and equity related products, structure and enter into equity derivative transactions and engage in proprietary trading. We also execute and clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Principal Investments. We generate net revenues from our corporate and real estate merchant banking investments, including the increased share of the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on a funds investments exceeds certain threshold returns (merchant banking overrides), as well as gains or losses related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG. Substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily and, therefore, its value and our net revenues are subject to fluctuations based on market movements. In addition, net revenues derived from our principal investments in privately held concerns and in real estate may fluctuate significantly depending on the revaluation or sale of these investments in any given period. We also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses. The number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period. Net revenues from Principal Investments do not include management fees generated from our merchant banking funds. These management fees are included in the net revenues of the Asset Management and Securities Services segment. (1) Our investment banking backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. 68 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the operating results of our Trading and Principal Investments segment: Trading and Principal Investments Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 FICC $ 8,484 $ 7,322 $ 5,596 Equities trading 2,675 1,969 1,738 Equities commissions 2,975 2,704 2,543 Total Equities 5,650 4,673 4,281 SMFG 1,475 771 293 Gross gains 767 855 593 Gross losses (198 ) (399 ) (437 ) Net other corporate and real estate investments 569 456 156 Overrides 184 105 117 Total Principal Investments 2,228 1,332 566 Total net revenues 16,362 13,327 10,443 Operating expenses 10,144 8,287 6,938 Pre tax earnings $ 6,218 $ 5,040 $ 3,505 2005 versus 2004. Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments of $16.36 billion for 2005 increased 23% compared with 2004. Net revenues in FICC of $8.48 billion increased 16% compared with 2004, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in credit products (which includes distressed investing) and, to a lesser extent, interest rate products and currencies. Net revenues in commodities and mortgages were strong, but essentially unchanged compared with 2004. During 2005, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity, tight, but volatile, credit spreads, higher energy prices and a flatter yield curve. Net revenues in Equities of $5.65 billion increased 21% compared with 2004, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in our customer franchise and principal strategies businesses. The increase in our customer franchise businesses reflected improved results in derivatives and shares, particularly in Europe and Asia, as well as in convertibles. In addition, results in principal strategies reflected strength across all regions. During 2005, Equities operated in an environment characterized by generally higher equity prices, improved customer driven activity and continued low levels of market volatility. Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $2.23 billion, due to a $1.48 billion gain related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG and $753 million in gains and overrides from other corporate and, to a lesser extent, real estate principal investments. Operating expenses of $10.14 billion for 2005 increased 22% compared with 2004, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment and, to a lesser extent, higher non compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Excluding non compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes, the increase in non compensation expenses was primarily attributable to higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, principally due to increased transaction volumes in FICC and Equities, and higher professional fees, due to increased legal and consulting fees. Pre tax earnings of $6.22 billion in 2005 increased 23% compared with 2004. 69 Table of Contents 2004 versus 2003. Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments of $13.33 billion for 2004 increased 28% compared with 2003. Net revenues in FICC of $7.32 billion increased 31% compared with 2003, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in credit products and commodities, as well as improved performances in currencies and mortgages. In addition, net revenues in interest rate products were strong, but were lower compared with 2003. During 2004, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity, rising energy prices, narrow corporate credit spreads and low, although rising, interest rates. The yield curve remained steep in 2004, but flattened in the second half of the year. Net revenues in Equities of $4.67 billion increased 9% compared with 2003, reflecting higher net revenues in our customer franchise business, primarily due to increased activity in shares and derivatives. In addition, net revenues were higher in our principal strategies business. During 2004, Equities operated in an environment characterized by improved customer driven activity, particularly early in the year, and generally higher equity prices. However, volatility levels continued to decline during 2004. Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $1.33 billion, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG of $771 million, as well as gains and overrides from other corporate principal investments. Operating expenses of $8.29 billion for 2004 increased 19% compared with 2003, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. Other expenses also increased, principally due to the acquisition of consolidated investments and increased levels of business activity. In addition, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees were higher, reflecting higher transaction volumes in certain of our businesses, professional fees increased, primarily due to higher consulting and legal fees, and market development expenses increased, primarily due to higher levels of business activity. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of identifiable intangible assets, as 2003 included impairment charges in respect of option specialist rights. In addition, occupancy expenses decreased, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space, and depreciation and amortization expenses were lower. Pre tax earnings of $5.04 billion in 2004 increased 44% compared with 2003. Asset Management and Securities Services Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided into two components: Asset Management. Asset Management provides investment advisory and financial planning services and offers investment products across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees. Securities Services. Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing services and securities lending services to mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, foundations and high net worth individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees. Assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage of asset value. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive asset management incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds return or when the return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other performance targets. Incentive fees are recognized when the performance period ends and they are no longer subject to adjustment. We have numerous incentive fee arrangements, many of which have annual performance periods that end on December 31 and are not subject to adjustment thereafter. For that reason, incentive fees are seasonally weighted each year to our first fiscal quarter. Depending on the level of net revenues in our first fiscal quarter of 2006, these incentive fees may be material to the results of operations in that quarter. 70 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the operating results of our Asset Management and Securities Services segment: Asset Management and Securities Services Operating Results (in millions) Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 Asset Management $ 2,956 $ 2,553 $ 1,853 Securities Services 1,793 1,296 1,005 Total net revenues 4,749 3,849 2,858 Operating expenses 3,070 2,430 1,890 Pre tax earnings $ 1,679 $ 1,419 $ 968 Assets under management include our mutual funds, alternative investment funds and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors.

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services of $4.75 billion for 2005 increased 23% compared with 2004. Asset Management net revenues of $2.96 billion increased 16% compared with 2004, primarily due to higher management fees, driven by growth in assets under management. During 2005, assets under management increased 18% to $532 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $63 billion across all asset classes as well as market appreciation of $17 billion, primarily in equity assets. Securities Services net revenues of $1.79 billion for 2005 increased 38% compared with 2004, primarily reflecting significantly higher global customer balances in securities lending and margin lending. Operating expenses of $3.07 billion for 2005 increased 26% compared with 2004, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. Other expenses also increased and professional fees were higher, principally due to increased consulting and legal fees. Pre tax earnings of $1.68 billion increased 18% compared with 2004. 2004 versus 2003. Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services of $3.85 billion for 2004 increased 35% compared with 2003. Asset Management net revenues of $2.55 billion increased 38% compared with 2003, primarily due to higher assets under management, significantly higher incentive fees and a full year contribution from Ayco. During 2004, assets under management increased 21% to $452 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $52 billion across all asset classes, as well as market appreciation of $27 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets. Securities Services net revenues of $1.30 billion increased 29% compared with 2003, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending. Operating expenses of $2.43 billion for 2004 increased 29% compared with 2003, primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher discretionary compensation and increased levels of employment. In addition, other expenses increased, principally due to higher levels of business activity, including increased Asset Management distribution costs. Professional fees were also higher, primarily reflecting increased legal and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and occupancy expenses, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in our global office space. Pre tax earnings of $1.42 billion increased 47% compared with 2003. 72 Table of Contents Geographic Data For a summary of the net revenues and pre tax earnings of Goldman Sachs by geographic region, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles; holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives; entering into operating leases; and providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit, representations and warranties. We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, primarily related to the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages, home equity and auto loans, government and corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets. Other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions; providing secondary market liquidity; making investments in performing and nonperforming debt, equity, real estate and other assets; providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes; and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process. Variable interest entities (VIEs) and qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets, since they provide market liquidity to financial assets by offering investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. Our financial interests in, and derivative transactions with, such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value, in the same manner as our other financial instruments, except in cases where we exert significant influence over an entity and apply the equity method of accounting. 73 Table of Contents The following table sets forth where a discussion of these and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in Part II, Items 7 and 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K: Type of Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Disclosure in Annual Report on Form 10 K Retained interests or contingent interests in assets transferred by us to nonconsolidated entities See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising out of variable interests we have in nonconsolidated entities See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Derivative contracts See Critical Accounting Policies above and Risk Management below and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Guarantees See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. Leases, letters of credit, and loans and other commitments See Capital and Funding below and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. In addition, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of our consolidation policies. Capital and Funding Capital The amount of capital we hold is principally determined by regulatory capital requirements, rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements and our overall risk profile, which is largely driven by the size and composition of our trading and investing positions. Goldman Sachs total capital (total shareholders equity and long term borrowings) increased 21% to $128.01 billion as of November 2005 compared with $105.78 billion as of November 2004. See Risk Management Liquidity Risk Cash Flows below for a discussion of how we deployed capital raised as part of our financing activities. The increase in total capital resulted primarily from an increase in long term borrowings to $100.01 billion as of November 2005 from $80.70 billion as of November 2004. The weighted average maturity of our long term borrowings as of November 2005 was approximately seven years. We swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into U.S. dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our long term borrowings. Over the past several years, our ratio of long term borrowings to total shareholders equity has been increasing. The growth in our long term borrowings has been driven primarily by (i) our ability to replace a portion of our short term borrowings with long term borrowings and pre fund near term refinancing requirements, in light of the favorable debt financing environment, and (ii) the need to increase total capital in response to growth in our trading and investing businesses. 74 Table of Contents Total shareholders equity increased by 12% to $28.00 billion (common equity of $26.25 billion and preferred stock of $1.75 billion) as of November 2005 from $25.08 billion as of November 2004. During 2005, Goldman Sachs issued 70,000 shares of preferred stock in three series as set forth in the following table: Preferred Stock by Series Shares Shares Earliest Redemption Value Series Description Date Issued Issued Authorized Redemption Date (in millions) A Perpetual Floating Rate April 25, 2005 30,000 50,000 April 25, 2010 $ 750 Non Cumulative B Perpetual 6.20% October 31, 2005 32,000 50,000 October 31, 2010 800 Non Cumulative C Perpetual Floating Rate October 31, 2005 8,000 25,000 October 31, 2010 200 Non Cumulative 70,000 125,000 $ 1,750 Each share of preferred stock has a par value of $0.01, has a liquidation preference of $25,000, is represented by1,000 depositary shares and is redeemable at our option at a redemption price equal to $25,000 plus declared and unpaid dividends. Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, our common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event we fail to pay or set aside full dividends on our preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period. All preferred stock also has a preference over our common stock upon liquidation. Our stock repurchase program is intended to help maintain our total shareholders equity at appropriate levels and to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee equity based compensation. The repurchase program has been effected primarily through regular open market purchases and is influenced by, among other factors, the level of our common shareholders equity, our overall capital position, employee equity awards granted and exercises of employee stock options, the prevailing market price of our common stock and general market conditions. During 2005, we repurchased 63.7 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $7.11 billion, and during 2004, we repurchased 18.7 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $1.81 billion. The average price paid per share for repurchased shares was $111.57 and $96.29 for the years ended November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. The increase in the level of repurchases in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflects our decision to manage the growth of our common shareholders equity. In addition, to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements related to the delivery of shares underlying restricted stock units, we cancelled 1.6 million restricted stock units at a total cost of $163 million in 2005 and we cancelled 9.1 million restricted stock units at a total cost of $870 million in 2004. As of November 2005, we were authorized to repurchase up to 42.7 million additional shares of stock pursuant to our repurchase program. For additional information on our repurchase program, see Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K. 75 Table of Contents The following table sets forth information on our assets, shareholders equity, leverage ratios and book value per common share: As of November 2005 2004 ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Total assets $ 706,804 $ 531,379 Adjusted assets (1) 466,019 347,082 Total shareholders equity 28,002 25,079 Tangible equity capital (2) 25,549 22,958 Leverage ratio (3) 25.2x 21.2x Adjusted leverage ratio (4) 18.2x 15.1x Debt to equity ratio (5) 3.6x 3.2x Common shareholders equity 26,252 25,079 Tangible common shareholders equity (6) 21,049 20,208 Book value per common share (7) $ 57.02 $ 50.77 Tangible book value per common share (8) 45.72 40.91 (1) Adjusted assets excludes (i) low risk collateralized assets generally associated with our matched book and securities lending businesses (which we calculate by adding our securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and then subtracting our nonderivative short positions), (ii) cash and securities we segregate for regulatory and other purposes and (iii) goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total assets to adjusted assets: As of November 2005 2004 (in millions) Total assets $ 706,804 $ 531,379 Deduct: Securities purchased under agreements to resell (83,619 ) (44,257 ) Securities borrowed (191,800 ) (155,086 ) Add: Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value 149,071 132,097 Less derivative liabilities (57,829 ) (64,001 ) Subtotal 91,242 68,096 Deduct: Cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes (51,405 ) (48,179 ) Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (5,203 ) (4,871 ) Adjusted assets $ 466,019 $ 347,082 (2) Tangible equity capital equals total shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to a trust less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We consider junior subordinated debt issued to a trust to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to the inherent characteristics of these securities, including the long term nature of the securities, our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of the obligations in our capital structure. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity capital: As of November 2005 2004 (in millions) Total shareholders equity $ 28,002 $ 25,079 Add: Junior subordinated debt issued to a trust 2,750 2,750 Deduct: Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (5,203 ) (4,871 ) Tangible equity capital $ 25,549 $ 22,958 76 Table of Contents (3) Leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity. (4) Adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital. We believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses. (5) Debt to equity ratio equals long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity. (6) Tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock and goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible common shareholders equity: As of November 2005 2004 (in millions) Total shareholders equity $ 28,002 $ 25,079 Deduct: Preferred stock (1,750 ) Common shareholders equity $ 26,252 $ 25,079 Deduct: Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (5,203 ) (4,871 ) Tangible common shareholders equity $ 21,049 $ 20,208 (7) Book value per common share is based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 460.4 million and 494.0 million as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. (8) Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements. Short Term Borrowings Goldman Sachs obtains secured and unsecured short term borrowings primarily through the issuance of promissory notes, commercial paper and bank loans. Short term borrowings also include the portion of long term borrowings maturing within one year of our financial statement date and certain long term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holder. The following table sets forth our short term borrowings by product: Short Term Borrowings (in millions) As of November 2005 2004 Promissory notes $ 17,339 $ 19,513 Commercial paper 5,154 4,355 Bank loans and other 15,975 13,474 Current portion of long term borrowings 16,751 17,617 Total $ 55,219 $ 54,959 Our liquidity depends to an important degree on our ability to refinance these borrowings on a continuous basis. Investors who hold our outstanding promissory notes (short term unsecured debt that is nontransferable and in which Goldman Sachs does not make a market) and commercial paper have no obligation to purchase new instruments when the outstanding instruments mature. 77 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our secured and unsecured short term borrowings: As of November 2005 2004 (in millions) Secured short term borrowings $ 7,972 $ 8,558 Unsecured short term borrowings 47,247 46,401 Total short term borrowings $ 55,219 $ 54,959 A large portion of our secured short term borrowings are similar in nature to our other collateralized financing sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase. These secured short term borrowings provide Goldman Sachs with a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured short term borrowings, as they are less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings due to underlying collateral. Our unsecured short term borrowings include extendible debt if the earliest maturity occurs within one year of our financial statement date. Extendible debt is debt that allows the holder the right to extend the maturity date at predetermined periods during the contractual life of the instrument. These borrowings can be, and in the past generally have been, extended. See Risk Management Liquidity Risk below for a discussion of the principal liquidity policies we have in place to manage the liquidity risk associated with our short term borrowings. For a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to access the capital markets, see Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business above. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our short term borrowings. Credit Ratings We rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions, including OTC derivatives. We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices, the level and variability of our earnings, our capital base, our franchise, reputation and management, our corporate governance and the external operating environment. See Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business above for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings. The following table sets forth our unsecured credit ratings as of November 2005: Short Term Debt Long Term Debt Preferred Stock Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited (1) R 1 (middle) A (high) N/A Fitch, Inc. F1 AA A Moodys Investors Service P 1 Aa3 A2 Standard Poors (2) A 1 A A (1) On November 22, 2005, Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited placed Goldman Sachs long term debt issuer rating under review with positive implications. (2) On October 11, 2005, Standard Poors affirmed Goldman Sachs long term debt rating and revised its outlook from stable to positive. 78 Table of Contents As of November 2005, collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately $384 million would have been required in the event of a one level reduction in our long term credit ratings. In evaluating our liquidity requirements, we consider additional collateral or termination payments that would be required in the event of further reductions in our long term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. For a further discussion of our excess liquidity policies, see Risk Management Liquidity Risk Excess Liquidity Maintenance of a Pool of Highly Liquid Securities below. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments Goldman Sachs has contractual obligations to make future payments under long term debt and long term noncancelable lease agreements and has contingent commitments under a variety of commercial arrangements. The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of November 2005: Contractual Obligations (in millions) 2007 2009 2011 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Total Long term borrowings by contractmaturity (1) (2) $ $ 23,613 $ 26,444 $ 49,950 $ 100,007 Minimum rental payments 399 875 594 2,134 4,002 (1) Long term borrowings maturing within one year of our financial statement date and certain long term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holder are included as short term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition. (2) Long term borrowings repayable at the option of Goldman Sachs are reflected at their contractual maturity dates. Certain long term borrowings that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are reflected at the dates such options become exercisable. As of November 2005, our long term borrowings were $100.01 billion and consisted principally of senior borrowings with maturities extending to 2035. These long term borrowings consisted of $15.67 billion in secured long term borrowings and $84.34 billion in unsecured long term borrowings. As of November 2005, long term borrowings included nonrecourse debt of $13.63 billion, consisting of $5.11 billion issued by William Street Funding Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Group Inc. formed to raise funding to support loan commitments to investment grade clients made by another wholly owned William Street entity), and $8.52 billion issued by other consolidated entities, of which $1.33 billion was related to our power generation facilities. Nonrecourse debt is debt that only the issuing subsidiary or, if applicable, a subsidiary guaranteeing the debt is obligated to repay. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our long term borrowings. 79 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our quarterly long term borrowings maturity profile through fiscal 2011: Long Term Borrowings Maturity Profile ($ in millions) (1) Our long term borrowings include extendible debt if the earliest maturity is one year or greater from our financial statement date. Extendible debt is categorized in the maturity profile at the earliest possible maturity date even though the debt can be, and in the past generally has been, extended. As of November 2005, our future minimum rental payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, under noncancelable leases were $4.00 billion. These lease commitments, principally for office space, expire on various dates through 2069. Certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges. During our third fiscal quarter of 2005, we announced plans for a new world headquarters in New York City, with initial occupancy scheduled for 2009, at an expected cost of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. Goldman Sachs will partially finance the project with tax exempt Liberty Bonds. As of November 2005, we borrowed approximately $1.4 billion through the issuance of Liberty Bonds and may borrow up to an additional $250 million through the issuance of additional Liberty Bonds before 2010. As of November 2005, we had outstanding construction related commitments of $47 million in connection with this project. Included in our future minimum rental payments under noncancelable lease agreements is $309 million related to a 64 year ground lease for the land on which our world headquarters will be constructed, of which $161 million is a lump sum payment due by June 2007. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our leases. Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels. We may incur exit costs in 2006 and thereafter to the extent we (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in the locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. These exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period. 80 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our contingent commitments as of November 2005: Contingent Commitments (in millions) Commitment Amount by Period of Expiration 2007 2009 2011 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Total Commitments to extend credit William Street program $ 1,811 $ 1,788 $ 9,385 $ 1,521 $ 14,505 Other commercial lending: Investment grade 9,592 5,893 1,008 1,099 17,592 Non investment grade 1,783 1,361 3,569 11,823 18,536 Warehouse financing 7,614 2,746 10 119 10,489 Total commitments to extend credit 20,800 11,788 13,972 14,562 61,122 Commitments under letters of credit issued by banks to counterparties 9,205 17 12 9,234 Other commercial commitments (1) 1,069 324 3,127 238 4,758 Total $ 31,074 $ 12,129 $ 17,111 $ 14,800 $ 75,114 (1) Includes our corporate and real estate investment fund commitments, construction related commitments and other purchase commitments. Our commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to counterparties that have fixed termination dates and are contingent on the satisfaction of all conditions to borrowing set forth in the contract. In connection with our lending activities, we had outstanding commitments of $61.12 billion as of November 2005 compared with $27.72 billion as of November 2004. The increase primarily related to our commercial lending activities outside the William Street credit extension program, and such commitments were generally extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and other types of corporate lending. Since these commitments may expire unused, the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements. We may reduce our credit risk on these commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to other investors. In addition, commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often short term in nature, as borrowers often replace them with other funding sources. With respect to the William Street credit extension program, substantially all of the commitments extended are to investment grade corporate borrowers. With respect to these commitments, we have credit loss protection provided to us by SMFG, which is generally limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on approved loan commitments, subject to a maximum of $1.00 billion. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will provide protection for 70% of the second loss on such commitments, subject to a maximum of $1.13 billion. We also use other financial instruments to hedge certain William Street commitments not covered by SMFG. As of November 2005, we had commitments to enter into forward secured financing transactions, including certain repurchase and resale agreements and secured borrowing and lending arrangements, of $49.93 billion. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our commitments, contingencies and guarantees. 81 Table of Contents Regulation During our second fiscal quarter of 2005, Goldman Sachs became regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE). As such, Goldman Sachs is subject to group wide supervision and examination by the SEC and is subject to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. As of November 2005, Goldman Sachs was in compliance with the CSE capital requirements. The European Unions European Financial Groups Directive (Directive 2002/87/EC) introduced certain changes to the way financial conglomerates and other financial services organizations operating in Europe are regulated. As a result of these changes, activities that are conducted in otherwise unregulated entities are now subject to certain forms of regulation, including consolidated supervision and capital adequacy requirements. The measures we have taken to comply with the directive include becoming regulated as a CSE. In addition, many of our principal subsidiaries are subject to separate regulation in the United States and or elsewhere. Goldman, Sachs Co. and Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P. are registered U.S. broker dealers and futures commissions merchants, and their primary regulators include the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Chicago Board of Trade, the NYSE, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the National Futures Association. Goldman Sachs International, a regulated U.K. broker dealer, is subject to regulation primarily by the Financial Services Authority. Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., a regulated broker dealer based in Tokyo, is subject to regulation by the Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange, The Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange, the Japan Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Several other subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs are regulated by securities, investment advisory, banking, and other regulators and authorities around the world, such as the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank in Germany, the Autorit des Marchs Financiers and Banque de France in France, Banca dItalia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Societ e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Italy, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our regulated subsidiaries. For a discussion of our potential inability to access funds from our regulated entities, see Risk Management Liquidity Risk Intercompany Funding below. Risk Management Management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of Goldman Sachs. Accordingly, we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities. These risks include market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational exposures. Risk Management Structure We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. In addition, a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process. These committees, whose responsibilities are described below, meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units. 82 Table of Contents Segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process. In addition to the committees described below, functions that are independent of the revenue producing units, such as Compliance, Finance, Legal, Management Controls (Internal Audit) and Operations, perform risk management functions, which include monitoring, analyzing and evaluating risk. Management Committee. All risk control functions ultimately report to our Management Committee. Through both direct and delegated authority, the Management Committee approves all of our operating activities, trading risk parameters and customer review guidelines. Risk Committees. The Firmwide Risk Committee reviews the activities of existing businesses, approves new businesses and products, approves firmwide and divisional market risk limits, reviews business unit market risk limits, approves market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and business units, approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group, and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements. The Divisional Risk Committee sets market risk limits for our trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk limits, based on a number of measures, including Value at Risk (VaR), stress tests and scenario analyses. Several other committees oversee various risk, valuation, operational, credit and business practice issues related to our asset management business. Business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks. Trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. Market risk limits are monitored by the Finance Division and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee. Limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and business unit managers and addressed, as necessary. Credit risk limits are also monitored by the Finance Division and reviewed by the appropriate risk committee. Business Practices Committee. The Business Practices Committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance, legal and operational risks and related reputational concerns, such as potential conflicts of interest. The Business Practices Committee also reviews the firms business practices, policies, and procedures for consistency with our business principles. The Business Practices Committee reviews these areas and makes recommendations for improvements as necessary to mitigate potential risks and assist in achieving adherence to our business principles. Capital Committee. The Capital Committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital. Such capital commitments include extensions of credit, alternative liquidity commitments, certain bond underwritings, certain distressed debt and principal finance activities, and certain equity linked structured products. The Capital Committee is also responsible for ensuring that business and reputational standards for capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. Commitments Committee. The Commitments Committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities, primarily with respect to offerings of equity and equity related securities, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, the Commitments Committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. Credit Policy Committee. The Credit Policy Committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the Credit Department. 83 Table of Contents Finance Committee. The Finance Committee establishes and ensures compliance with our liquidity policies, approves balance sheet limits and has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk, the size and composition of our balance sheet and capital base, and our credit ratings. The Finance Committee regularly reviews our balance sheet, funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events, risks and exposures. New Products Committee. The New Products Committee, under the oversight of the Firmwide Risk Committee, is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and businesses globally. Operational Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies, framework and methodologies, and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management. Structured Products Committee. The Structured Products Committee reviews and approves structured product transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal, regulatory, tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to Goldman Sachs. Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk. Such positions result from market making, specialist, proprietary trading and investing, and underwriting activities. Categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. A description of each market risk category is set forth below: Interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads. Equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, equity baskets and equity indices. Currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates. Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and precious and base metals. We seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures, controlling position sizes and establishing hedges in related securities or derivatives. For example, we may hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract. The ability to manage an exposure may, however, be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument. 84 Table of Contents In addition to applying business judgment, senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk. These tools include: risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as VaR, which are updated and monitored on a daily basis; scenario analyses, stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our net revenues of various market events, including, but not limited to, a large widening of credit spreads, a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected sovereign markets; and inventory position limits for selected business units. VaR VaR is the potential loss in value of Goldman Sachs trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For the VaR numbers reported below, a one day time horizon and a 95% confidence level were used. This means that there is a 1 in 20 chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported VaR. Thus, shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported VaR would be anticipated to occur, on average, about once a month. Shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported VaR by significant amounts. Shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days. The VaR numbers below are shown separately for interest rate, equity, currency and commodity products, as well as for our overall trading positions. The VaR numbers in each risk category include the underlying product positions and related hedges that may include positions in other product areas. For example, the hedge of a foreign exchange forward may include an interest rate futures position, and the hedge of a long corporate bond position may include a short position in the related equity. The modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable, there is no standard methodology for estimating VaR, and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different VaR estimates. We use historical data to estimate our VaR and, to better reflect current asset volatilities, we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations. Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Different VaR methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different VaR. Moreover, VaR calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day. Changes in VaR between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of exposure, volatilities and or correlations among asset classes. 85 Table of Contents The following tables set forth the daily VaR: Average Daily VaR (1) (in millions) Year Ended November Risk Categories 2005 2004 2003 Interest rates $ 37 $ 36 $ 38 Equity prices 34 32 27 Currency rates 17 20 18 Commodity prices 26 20 18 Diversification effect (2) (44 ) (41 ) (43 ) Total $ 70 $ 67 $ 58 (1) During the second quarter of 2004, we began to exclude from our calculation other debt portfolios that cannot be properly measured in VaR. The effect of excluding these portfolios was not material to prior periods and, accordingly, such periods have not been adjusted. For a further discussion of the market risk associated with these portfolios, see Other Debt Portfolios below. (2) Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Our average daily VaR increased to $70 million in 2005 from $67 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates, partially offset by reduced exposures to currency rates, as well as reduced volatilities, particularly in interest rate and equity assets. Our average daily VaR increased to $67 million in 2004 from $58 million in 2003, primarily due to higher levels of exposure to equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices, partially offset by reduced exposures to interest rates, as well as reduced volatilities, particularly in interest rate and equity assets. Daily VaR (in millions) Year Ended As of November November 2005 Risk Categories 2005 2004 High Low Interest rates $ 45 $ 28 $ 53 $ 26 Equity prices 54 25 62 21 Currency rates 10 18 31 9 Commodity prices 18 35 37 16 Diversification effect (1) (44 ) (40 ) Total $ 83 $ 66 $ 91 $ 51 (1) Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Our daily VaR increased to $83 million as of November 2005 from $66 million as of November 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to equity prices and interest rates, partially offset by reduced exposures to commodity prices and currency rates, as well as reduced volatilities in equity, currency and commodity assets. 86 Table of Contents The following chart presents our daily VaR during 2005: Daily VaR ($ in millions) Trading Net Revenues Distribution Substantially all of our inventory positions are marked to market on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues. The following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in VaR for the year ended November 2005: Daily Trading Net Revenues ($ in millions) Daily Trading Net Revenues As part of our overall risk control process, daily trading net revenues are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Trading losses incurred on a single day did not exceed our 95% one day VaR during 2005. 87 Table of Contents Other Debt Portfolios The market risk associated with portfolios in our credit products business that cannot be properly measured in VaR (primarily due to inadequate historical data on the underlying assets in the aggregate) is measured based on a potential 10% decline in the asset value of such portfolios. The market values of the underlying positions are sensitive to changes in a number of factors, including discount rates and the projected timing and amount of future cash flows. As of November 2005, the potential impact of a 10% decline in the asset value of these portfolios was $669 million compared with $416 million as of November 2004. The increase in 2005 is primarily due to new investments in the Americas and Asia. Nontrading Risk SMFG. The market risk of our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, net of the economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying a portion of our investment, is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a 10% decline in the SMFG common stock price. As of November 2005, the sensitivity of our investment to a 10% decline in the SMFG common stock price was $262 million compared with $236 million as of November 2004. The change is primarily due to an increase in the SMFG common stock price and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock, partially offset by the effect of hedging the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment. This sensitivity should not be extrapolated to other movements in the SMFG common stock price, as the relationship between the fair value of our investment and the SMFG common stock price is nonlinear. Other Principal Investments. The market risk for financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio, including our merchant banking investments but excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a 10% decline in equity markets. This sensitivity analysis is based on certain assumptions regarding the relationship between changes in stock price indices and changes in the fair value of the individual financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio. Different assumptions could produce materially different risk estimates. As of November 2005, the sensitivity of our nontrading portfolio (excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG) to a 10% equity market decline was $181 million compared with $118 million as of November 2004, primarily reflecting new private investments. Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us, or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold. To reduce our credit exposures, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. In addition, we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by (i) entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events, (ii) seeking third party guarantees of the counterpartys obligations, and or (iii) using credit derivatives and other structures and techniques. For most businesses, counterparty credit limits are established by the Credit Department, which is independent of the revenue producing departments, based on guidelines set by the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Credit Policy Committee. For most products, we measure and limit credit exposures by reference to both current and potential exposure. We typically measure potential exposure based on projected worst case market movements over the life of a transaction within a 95% confidence interval. For collateralized transactions, we also evaluate potential exposure over a shorter collection period, and give effect to the value of collateral received. We further seek to measure credit exposure through the use of scenario analyses, stress tests and other quantitative 88 Table of Contents tools. Our global credit management systems monitor current and potential credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates. These systems also provide management, including the Firmwide Risk and Credit Policy Committees, with information regarding overall credit risk by product, industry sector, country and region. As of both November 2005 and November 2004, we held U.S. government and federal agency obligations that represented 7% and 5% of our total assets, respectively. In addition, most of our securities purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized by U.S. government, federal agency and other sovereign obligations. As of November 2005 and November 2004, we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded 5% of our total assets. However, over the past several years, the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing, due to, among other factors, the growth of our lending and OTC derivative activities. A further discussion of our derivative activities follows below. Derivatives Derivative contracts are instruments, such as futures, forwards, swaps or option contracts, that derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors. Derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as OTC derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange. Substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes, to facilitate client transactions, to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management. In addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes, we enter into derivative contracts to hedge our net investment in non U.S. operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings. Derivatives are used in many of our businesses, and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged, or as part of a broader trading strategy. Accordingly, the market risk of derivative positions is managed together with our nonderivative positions. Fair values of our derivative contracts are reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. For an OTC derivative, our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract. The following table sets forth the distribution, by credit rating, of substantially all of our exposure with respect to OTC derivatives as of November 2005, after taking into consideration the effect of netting agreements. The categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents. Over the Counter Derivative Credit Exposure ($ in millions) Exposure Percentage of Collateral Net of Total Exposure Credit Rating Equivalent Exposure (1) Held Collateral Net of Collateral AAA/Aaa $ 4,332 $ 222 $ 4,110 12 % AA/Aa2 9,721 1,801 7,920 22 A/A2 13,166 3,332 9,834 28 BBB/Baa2 10,209 2,809 7,400 21 BB/Ba2 or lower 8,859 3,330 5,529 15 Unrated 1,376 582 794 2 Total $ 47,663 $ 12,076 $ 35,587 100 % (1) Net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of $22.61 billion. 89 Table of Contents The following tables set forth our OTC derivative credit exposure, net of collateral, by remaining contractual maturity: Exposure Net of Collateral (in millions) 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Credit Rating Equivalent Months Months Years Years or Greater Total (1) AAA/Aaa $ 858 $ 367 $ 1,053 $ 1,074 $ 758 $ 4,110 AA/Aa2 1,897 596 1,954 2,228 1,245 7,920 A/A2 3,049 1,009 2,542 1,841 1,393 9,834 BBB/Baa2 2,151 621 2,700 409 1,519 7,400 BB/Ba2 or lower 1,558 352 2,850 508 261 5,529 Unrated 293 124 193 168 16 794 Total $ 9,806 $ 3,069 $ 11,292 $ 6,228 $ 5,192 $ 35,587 0 6 6 12 1 5 5 10 10 Years Contract Type Months Months Years Years or Greater Total (1) Interest rates $ 1,591 $ 346 $ 3,212 $ 4,237 $ 3,946 $ 13,332 Currencies 4,395 609 1,506 739 1,022 8,271 Commodities 3,381 1,240 6,082 711 116 11,530 Equities 439 874 492 541 108 2,454 Total $ 9,806 $ 3,069 $ 11,292 $ 6,228 $ 5,192 $ 35,587 (1) Where we have obtained collateral from a counterparty under a master trading agreement that covers multiple products and transactions, we have allocated the collateral ratably based on exposure before giving effect to such collateral. Derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty, that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty. We attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction. In addition, certain derivative transactions involve the risk that we may have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical settlement requirement or that the derivative may have been assigned to a different counterparty without our knowledge or consent. Liquidity Risk Liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector. Most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events. Our principal objective is to be able to fund Goldman Sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenue even under adverse circumstances. Management has implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework: Excess Liquidity maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment including financing obligations. Asset Liability Management ensure we fund our assets with appropriate financing. Intercompany Funding maintain parent company liquidity and manage the distribution of liquidity across the group structure. Crisis Planning ensure all funding and liquidity management is based on stress scenario planning and feeds into our liquidity crisis plan. 90 Table of Contents Excess Liquidity Maintenance of a Pool of Highly Liquid Securities. Our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity. This Global Core Excess liquidity is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets. We believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment. Our Global Core Excess reflects the following principles: The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a companys survival. Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Goldman Sachs businesses are diverse, and its cash needs are driven by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our unsecured liabilities. The following table sets forth the average loan value (the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities) of our Global Core Excess: Year Ended November 2005 2004 (in millions) U.S. dollar denominated $ 35,310 $ 33,858 Non U.S. dollar denominated 11,029 8,135 Total Global Core Excess $ 46,339 $ 41,993 The U.S. dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered U.S. government and agency securities and highly liquid mortgage securities, all of which are Federal Reserve repo eligible, as well as overnight cash deposits. Our non U.S. dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered French, German, United Kingdom and Japanese government bonds and euro, British pound and Japanese yen overnight cash deposits. We strictly limit our Global Core Excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash that we believe are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. The majority of our Global Core Excess is structured such that it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and all of its subsidiaries. The remainder is held in our principal non U.S. operating entities, primarily to better match the currency and timing requirements for those entities potential liquidity obligations. 91 Table of Contents The size of our Global Core Excess is determined by an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of Goldman Sachs. Our liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis, including, but not limited to: upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit; potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt; adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding; derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows, including those due to market moves or increased requirements; additional collateral that could be called in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings; draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by William Street Funding Corporation (1); and upcoming cash outflows, such as tax and other large payments. Other Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our Global Core Excess described above, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities. These assets, which are located in the United States, Europe and Asia, include other government bonds, high grade money market securities, corporate bonds and marginable equities. We do not include these securities in our Global Core Excess. We maintain Global Core Excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that, if pledged or sold, would provide the funds necessary to replace at least 110% of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature (or where holders have the option to redeem) within the next 12 months. This implies that we could fund our positions on a secured basis for one year in the event we were unable to issue new unsecured debt or liquidate assets. We assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions asset by asset. The estimated aggregate loan value of our Global Core Excess and our other unencumbered assets averaged $125.36 billion in 2005 and $100.51 billion in 2004. Asset Liability Management Asset Quality and Balance Sheet Composition. We seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily. We utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold inventory over longer periods of time. We believe that these limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard position limits. In addition, we periodically reduce the size of certain parts of our balance sheet to comply with period end limits set by management. Because of these periodic reductions and certain other factors including seasonal activity, market conventions and periodic market opportunities in certain of our businesses that result in larger positions during the middle of our reporting periods, our balance sheet fluctuates between financial statement dates and is lower at fiscal period end than would be observed on an average basis. Over the last six quarters, our total assets and adjusted assets at quarter end have been, on average, 9% and 11% lower, respectively, than amounts that would have been observed, based on a weekly average, over that period. These differences, however, have not resulted in material changes to our credit risk, market risk or liquidity position because they are generally in highly liquid assets that are typically financed on a secured basis. (1) The Global Core Excess excludes liquid assets held separately to support the William Street credit extension program. 92 Table of Contents Certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress and, accordingly, we generally hold higher levels of capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments. The table below sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments: As of November 2005 2004 (in millions) Mortgage whole loans and collateralized debt obligations (1) $ 31,459 $ 18,346 Bank loans (2) 13,843 8,900 High yield securities 8,822 6,057 Emerging market debt securities 1,789 1,653 SMFG convertible preferred stock 4,058 2,556 Other corporate principal investments (3) 1,723 1,278 Real estate principal investments (3) 745 820 (1) Includes certain mortgage backed interests held in QSPEs. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding our securitization activities. (2) Includes funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary trading activities. (3) Excludes assets for which Goldman Sachs is not at risk (e.g., assets related to consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds) of $1.93 billion and $1.28 billion as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively. A large portion of these assets are funded on a secured basis through secured funding markets or nonrecourse financing. We focus on demonstrating a consistent ability to fund these assets on a secured basis for extended periods of time to reduce refinancing risk and to help ensure that these assets have an established amount of loan value in order that they can be funded in periods of market stress. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold. Appropriate Financing of Asset Base. We seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due, even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress. We generally do not rely on immediate sales of assets (other than our Global Core Excess) to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment. However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity crisis. In order to avoid reliance on asset sales, our goal is to ensure that we have sufficient total capital (long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity) to fund our balance sheet for at least one year. We seek to maintain total capital in excess of the aggregate of the following long term financing requirements: the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress, assuming conservative loan values; goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, property, leasehold improvements and equipment, and other illiquid assets; derivative and other margin and collateral requirements; anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments; and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that is in excess of their long term financing requirements. See Intercompany Funding below for a further discussion of how we fund our subsidiaries. Our total capital of $128.01 billion and $105.78 billion as of November 2005 and November 2004, respectively, exceeded the aggregate of these requirements. 93 Table of Contents Conservative Liability Structure. We structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce refinancing risk as well as the risk that we may redeem or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity. For example, we may repurchase Goldman Sachs commercial paper through the ordinary course of business as a market maker. As such, we emphasize the use of promissory notes (in which Goldman Sachs does not make a market) over commercial paper in order to improve the stability of our short term unsecured financing base. We have also created internal guidelines regarding the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any single week or year and have average maturity targets for our unsecured debt programs. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding. We have imposed various internal guidelines, including the amount of our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors. We benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own sales force to a large, diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. We access funding in a variety of markets in the United States, Europe and Asia. We issue debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and 144A medium term note programs, offshore medium term note offerings and other bond offerings, U.S. and non U.S. commercial paper and promissory note issuances, and other methods. We make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets and arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf. Additionally, unsecured debt issued by Group Inc. does not contain provisions that would, based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or our stock price, trigger a requirement for an early payment, collateral support, change in terms, acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation. Intercompany Funding Subsidiary Funding Policies. Substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company, Group Inc. The parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing and capital requirements. In addition, the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an assumption that, unless legally provided for, funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on obligations, including debt obligations. As such, we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries. In addition, we assume that the Global Core Excess held in our principal non U.S. operating entities will not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities. We also manage our intercompany exposure by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company. This policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent companys third party borrowings. In addition, many of our subsidiaries and affiliates pledge collateral at loan value to the parent company to cover their intercompany borrowings (other than subordinated debt) in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk. 94 Table of Contents Equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with parent company equity capital. As of November 2005, Group Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was $25.26 billion compared with its total shareholders equity of $28.00 billion. Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries; for example, as of November 2005, Group Inc. had $17.04 billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in Goldman, Sachs Co., its principal U.S. registered broker dealer; $16.06 billion invested in Goldman Sachs International, a regulated U.K. broker dealer; $2.41 billion invested in Goldman Sachs Execution Clearing, L.P., a U.S. registered broker dealer; and $1.98 billion invested in Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., a regulated broker dealer based in Tokyo. Group Inc. also had $44.52 billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of November 2005, as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. Subsidiary Foreign Exchange Policies. Our capital invested in non U.S. subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is hedged. In addition, we generally hedge the nontrading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entitys functional currency. Crisis Planning In order to be prepared for a liquidity event, or a period of market stress, we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario planning. In addition, we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event. The plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on Goldman Sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on the severity of the event. It also lists the crisis management team and internal and external parties to be contacted to ensure effective distribution of information. Cash Flows As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and, consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our business. Year Ended November 2005. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $5.90 billion to $10.26 billion at the end of 2005. We raised $19.37 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily in long term debt, in light of the favorable debt financing environment, partially offset by common stock repurchases. We used net cash of $13.48 billion in our operating and investing activities, primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for ourselves and our clients. Year Ended November 2004. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.72 billion to $4.37 billion at the end of 2004. We raised $31.75 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily in long term debt, in light of the favorable debt financing environment. We used net cash of $34.47 billion in our operating and investing activities, primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for ourselves and our clients, to meet additional collateral requirements at securities exchanges and clearing organizations and to provide additional funding support for our William Street loan commitments program. 95 Table of Contents Year Ended November 2003. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $2.27 billion to $7.09 billion at the end of 2003. We raised $20.58 billion in net cash from financing activities, primarily in long term debt. We used net cash of $18.32 billion in our operating and investing activities primarily to capitalize on opportunities in our trading and principal investing businesses, including the purchase of investments that could be difficult to fund in periods of market stress. We also increased our Global Core Excess, provided funding support for our William Street loan commitments program, invested in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG and financed the acquisition of East Coast Power L.L.C. Operational Risk Operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes, people or systems, and from external events. Operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents arising, for example, from major systems failures. Operational risk may also cause reputational harm. Thus, efforts to identify, manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss. We manage operational risk through the application of long standing, but continuously evolving, firmwide control standards: the training, supervision and development of our people; the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks across the firm; and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis. Together, these elements form a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize events that create operational risk and the damage they can cause. The Operational Risk Department, an independent risk management function, is responsible for developing and implementing a standardized framework to identify, measure, monitor and manage operational risk across the firm. This framework, which evolves with the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance, takes into account internal and external operational risk events, business environment and internal control factors, the ongoing analysis of business specific risk metrics and the use of scenario analysis. While individual business units have direct responsibility for the control and mitigation of operational risk, this framework provides a consistent methodology for identifying and monitoring operational risk factors at the business unit and firmwide level. Recent Accounting Developments In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123 R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123 R establishes standards of accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. SFAS No. 123 R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. Two key differences between SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123 R relate to attribution of compensation costs to reporting periods and accounting for award forfeitures. SFAS No. 123 R generally requires the immediate expensing of equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees. However, awards granted subject to a substantive non compete agreement are generally expensed over the non compete period. SFAS No. 123 R also requires expected forfeitures to be included in determining stock based employee compensation expense. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10 K, Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation for a discussion of how we currently account for equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and forfeitures. We will adopt SFAS No. 123 R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Management is currently evaluating the effect of adoption of SFAS No. 123 R on our results of operations with respect to awards granted to retirement eligible employees that are subject to a non compete agreement. 96 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the pro forma net earnings that would have been reported for each year if equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees had been expensed over the non compete period and if expected forfeitures had been accrued as required by SFAS No. 123 R: Year Ended November 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Net earnings applicable to common shareholders, as reported $ 5,609 $ 4,553 $ 3,005 Add: Stock based employee compensation expense, net of related tax effects, included in reported net earnings 1,133 790 458 Deduct: Stock based employee compensation expense, net of related tax effects, determined under SFAS No. 123 R (1,106 ) (802 ) (503 ) Pro forma net earnings applicable to common shareholders $ 5,636 $ 4,541 $ 2,960 In June 2005, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, which requires general partners (or managing members in the case of limited liability companies) to consolidate their partnerships or to provide limited partners with rights to remove the general partner or to terminate the partnership. Goldman Sachs, as the general partner of numerous merchant banking and asset management partnerships, is required to adopt the provisions of EITF 04 5 (i) immediately for partnerships formed or modified after June 29, 2005 and (ii) in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 for partnerships formed on or before June 29, 2005 that have not been modified. We generally expect to provide limited partners in these funds with rights to remove Goldman Sachs or rights to terminate the partnerships and, therefore, do not expect that EITF 04 5 will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
