Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 39 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Executive Overview The firm generated net earnings of $4.44 billion for 2011, compared with $8.35 billion and $13.39 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our diluted earnings per common share were $4.51 for the year ended December 2011, compared with $13.18 1 for the year ended December 2010 and $22.13 for the year ended December 2009. Return on average common shareholders equity (ROE) 2 was 3.7% for 2011, compared with 11.5% 1 for 2010 and 22.5% for 2009. During 2011, we redeemed the 50,000 shares of our 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series G (Series G Preferred Stock) held by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Berkshire Hathaway). Excluding the impact of the $1.64 billion preferred dividend related to this redemption, diluted earnings per common share were $7.46 3 and ROE was 5.9% 3 for 2011. Book value per common share was $130.31 and tangible book value per common share 4 was $119.72 as of December 2011, both approximately 1% higher compared with the end of 2010. During the year, the firm repurchased 47.0 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $6.04 billion. Our Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel 1 was 13.8% and our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel 1 5 was 12.1% as of December 2011. 2011 versus 2010. The firm generated net revenues of $28.81 billion for 2011. These results reflected significantly lower net revenues in Investing & Lending and Institutional Client Services, as well as lower net revenues in Investment Banking, compared with 2010. Net revenues in Investment Management were essentially unchanged compared with 2010. An overview of net revenues for each of our business segments is provided below. Investment Banking The decrease in Investment Banking primarily reflected lower net revenues in our Underwriting business. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly lower than 2010, principally due to a decline in industry wide activity. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with 2010. Net revenues in Financial Advisory decreased slightly compared with 2010. Institutional Client Services The decrease in Institutional Client Services compared with 2010 reflected significantly lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution. Although activity levels in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels, and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011, the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty, resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads, which contributed to difficult market making conditions and led to reductions in risk by us and our clients. As a result of these conditions, net revenues across the franchise were lower, including significant declines in mortgages and credit products, compared with 2010. Net revenues in Equities were slightly higher compared with 2010. During 2011, average volatility levels increased and equity prices in Europe and Asia declined significantly, particularly during the third quarter. The increase in net revenues reflected higher commissions and fees, primarily due to higher transaction volumes, particularly during the third quarter of 2011. In addition, net revenues in securities services increased compared with 2010, reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances. Equities client execution net revenues were lower than 2010, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in shares. 40 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 1. Excluding the impact of the $465 million related to the U.K. bank payroll tax, the $550 million related to the SEC settlement and the $305 million impairment of our New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Designated Market Maker (DMM) rights, diluted earnings per common share were $15.22 and ROE was 13.1% for 2010. We believe that presenting our 2010 results excluding the impact of these items is meaningful because it increases the comparability of period to period results. Diluted earnings per common share and ROE excluding these items are non GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. See Results of Operations Financial Overview below for further information about our calculation of diluted earnings per common share and ROE excluding the impact of these items. 2. See Results of Operations Financial Overview below for further information about our calculation of ROE. 3. We believe that presenting our 2011 results excluding the impact of the $1.64 billion preferred dividend related to the redemption of our Series G Preferred Stock (calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock) is meaningful because it increases the comparability of period to period results. Diluted earnings per common share and ROE excluding this item are non GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. See Results of Operations Financial Overview below for further information about our calculation of diluted earnings per common share and ROE excluding the impact of this dividend. 4. Tangible book value per common share is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. See Equity Capital Other Capital Metrics below for further information about our calculation of tangible book value per common share. 5. Tier 1 common ratio is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. See Equity Capital Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios below for further information about our Tier 1 common ratio. Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Investing & Lending Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $2.14 billion and $7.54 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Results for 2011 included a loss of $517 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and net gains of $1.12 billion from other investments in equities, primarily in private equity positions, partially offset by losses from public equities. In addition, Investing & Lending included net revenues of $96 million from debt securities and loans. This amount includes approximately $1 billion of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities, including the effect of hedges, offset by net interest income and net gains from other debt securities and loans. Results for 2011 also included other net revenues of $1.44 billion, principally related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Investment Management Net revenues in Investment Management were essentially unchanged compared with 2010, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, offset by lower incentive fees. During the year, assets under management decreased $12 billion to $828 billion, reflecting net outflows of $17 billion, partially offset by net market appreciation of $5 billion. Net outflows primarily reflected outflows in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by inflows in money market assets. 2010 versus 2009. The firm generated net revenues of $39.16 billion for 2010, despite a challenging operating environment. These results reflected significantly lower net revenues in Institutional Client Services and slightly lower net revenues in Investment Banking compared with 2009. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Investing & Lending and higher net revenues in Investment Management. An overview of net revenues for each of our business segments is provided below. Investment Banking The decrease in Investment Banking reflected lower net revenues in our Underwriting business, partially offset by higher net revenues in Financial Advisory. The decline in Underwriting reflected lower net revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in client activity in comparison to 2009, which included significant capital raising activity by financial institution clients. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with 2009. The increase in Financial Advisory primarily reflected an increase in client activity. Institutional Client Services The decrease in Institutional Client Services reflected significantly lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and, to a lesser extent, Equities. During 2010, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment characterized by lower client activity levels, which reflected broad market concerns including European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, as well as tighter bid/offer spreads. The decrease in net revenues compared with a particularly strong 2009 primarily reflected significantly lower results in interest rate products, credit products, commodities and, to a lesser extent, currencies. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in mortgages, as 2009 included approximately $1 billion of losses related to commercial mortgage loans. The decline in Equities compared with 2009 primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, principally due to significantly lower results in derivatives and shares. Commissions and fees were also lower than 2009, primarily reflecting lower client activity levels. In addition, securities services net revenues were significantly lower compared with 2009, primarily reflecting tighter securities lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances. During 2010, although equity markets were volatile during the first half of the year, equity prices generally improved and volatility levels declined in the second half of the year. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 41 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Investing & Lending Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $7.54 billion and $2.86 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, an increase in global equity markets and tighter credit spreads provided a favorable backdrop for our Investing & Lending business. Results in Investing & Lending for 2010 included a gain of $747 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net gain of $2.69 billion from other investments in equities, a net gain of $2.60 billion from debt securities and loans and other net revenues of $1.51 billion, principally related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Investment Management The increase in Investment Management primarily reflected higher incentive fees across our alternative investment products. Management and other fees also increased, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as the impact of appreciation in the value of client assets. During 2010, assets under management decreased 4% to $840 billion, primarily reflecting outflows in money market assets, consistent with industry trends. Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable earnings. Our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic conditions generally and other factors. For a further discussion of the factors that may affect our future operating results, see Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses below, as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. 42 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Business Environment Global economic growth generally moderated in 2011, as real gross domestic product (GDP) grew in most major economies and emerging markets, but at a slower pace than in 2010. Certain unfavorable market conditions that emerged in 2010 continued during the year, including concerns about European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty regarding financial regulatory reform. Additional concerns that emerged during the first half of the year that affected our businesses included political unrest in the Middle East, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and inflation in emerging markets. During the second half of the year, concerns about European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system intensified, while concerns about U.S. growth and the uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal debt ceiling emerged, contributing to higher volatility levels, significantly lower global equity prices and significantly wider corporate credit spreads. This prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to announce easing measures in order to stimulate economic growth in the U.S. and to alleviate concerns about Europe. Industry wide completed and announced mergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with 2010, but declined during the second half of the year. Industry wide equity and equity related offerings and industry wide debt offerings both decreased compared with 2010, including significant declines during the second half of the year. For a further discussion of how market conditions affect our businesses, see Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses below as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Global During 2011, real GDP growth declined in most major economies and emerging markets. The slowdown in economic growth primarily reflected slower growth in domestic demand compared with 2010, while international trade continued to grow strongly during 2011. Unemployment levels declined slightly compared with 2010, although the rate of unemployment remained elevated in some economies. During 2011, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged, while the European Central Bank increased and then reduced its interest rate during the year, ending the year unchanged compared with 2010. In addition, the Peoples Bank of China increased its one year benchmark lending rate during the year. The price of crude oil increased during 2011. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro and was essentially unchanged against the British pound, while it weakened against the Japanese yen. United States In the United States, real GDP increased by 1.7% in 2011, compared with an increase of 3.0% in 2010. Growth moderated, primarily reflecting a decline in government spending and reduced growth in exports, although business investment and consumer expenditure increased. Business and consumer confidence declined during most of the year, primarily reflecting increased global economic concerns and uncertainties. In addition, residential investment remained weak and measures of core inflation increased during the year from low levels. Growth in industrial production decreased, primarily reflecting the impact of supply chain disruptions associated with Japan earlier in the year. The unemployment rate declined slightly during the year, although it remained high. The U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its federal funds rate at a target range of zero to 0.25% during the year. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve concluded quantitative easing measures that included the purchase of significant amounts of U.S. Treasury debt and announced further easing measures by extending the duration of the U.S. Treasury debt it holds. The yield on the 10 year U.S. Treasury note fell by 141 basis points during 2011 to 1.89%. In equity markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 6%, while the NASDAQ Composite Index decreased by 2% and the S&P 500 Index ended the year essentially unchanged. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 43 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Europe Real GDP in the Euro area economies increased by an estimated 1.6% in 2011, compared with an increase of 1.8% in 2010. Growth moderated slightly, primarily reflecting reduced growth in consumer expenditure and exports, although fixed investment increased. Surveys of business and consumer confidence deteriorated over the course of the year. Measures of core inflation increased during the year from low levels. Concerns about fiscal challenges in several Euro area economies intensified during the year, weighing on economic growth in these economies and on risk appetite more broadly. In addition, concerns about European sovereign debt risk contributed to higher market volatility and funding pressures. The European Central Bank and governments in the Euro area took a range of policy measures to address these issues. The European Central Bank increased its main refinancing operations rate by 25 basis points during both the second and third quarters, but reversed these increases during the fourth quarter, such that the rate ended the year at 1.00%, unchanged compared with the end of 2010. In the United Kingdom, real GDP increased by 0.8% for 2011, compared with an increase of 2.1% in 2010. The Bank of England maintained its official bank rate at 0.50% during the year. Long term government bond yields generally declined during the year, although long term government bond yields in certain Euro area economies increased significantly. In addition, spreads between German bond yields and those of most Euro area economies widened during the year. The Euro depreciated by 3% and the British pound was essentially unchanged against the U.S. dollar. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index and the CAC 40 Index both declined by 17%, while the DAX Index and the FTSE 100 Index decreased by 15% and 6%, respectively, compared with the end of 2010. Asia In Japan, real GDP decreased by 0.9% in 2011, compared with an increase of 4.4% in 2010. Net exports and business investment declined during the year due to the economic impact of the earthquake and tsunami in the first quarter. Measures of inflation remained negative during 2011. The Bank of Japan maintained its target overnight call rate at a range of zero to 0.10% and the yield on 10 year Japanese government bonds fell by 14 basis points to 0.99%. The Japanese yen appreciated by 5% against the U.S. dollar. The Nikkei 225 Index decreased by 17% during the year. In China, real GDP increased by 9.2% in 2011 compared with an increase of 10.4% in 2010. Growth moderated, primarily reflecting a slowdown in net exports and fixed investment growth, although consumer spending increased. Measures of inflation increased significantly during 2011, reflecting the impact of higher food and energy prices, but decreased towards the end of the year. The Peoples Bank of China raised its one year benchmark lending rate by 75 basis points to 6.56% and increased the reserve requirement ratio by 250 basis points during the year. In addition, the Chinese yuan appreciated by 4% against the U.S. dollar and the Shanghai Composite Index decreased by 22% during 2011. In India, real GDP increased by an estimated 6.9% in 2011 compared with an increase of 8.5% in 2010. Growth moderated, primarily reflecting a slowdown in consumer expenditure and fixed investment growth. The rate of wholesale inflation remained at elevated levels, but decreased during the year. The Indian rupee depreciated by 19% against the U.S. dollar. Equity markets in Hong Kong and India declined significantly and equity markets in South Korea ended the year lower. Other Markets In Brazil, real GDP increased by an estimated 3.0% in 2011, compared with an increase of 7.5% in 2010. Growth moderated, primarily reflecting a slowdown in investment and consumer expenditure growth. The Brazilian real weakened against the U.S. dollar. Brazilian equity prices ended the year significantly lower compared with the end of 2010. In Russia, real GDP increased by an estimated 4.2% in 2011, compared with an increase of 4.0% in 2010. Growth was driven by an increase in domestic demand, particularly during the second half of the year. The Russian ruble weakened against the U.S. dollar and Russian equity prices ended the year significantly lower compared with the end of 2010. 44 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Policies Fair Value Fair Value Hierarchy. Financial instruments owned, at fair value and Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value (i.e., inventory), as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value (i.e., marked to market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and the firms credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. Instruments categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which represent approximately 5% of the firms total assets, require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include: determining the appropriate valuation methodology and or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument; determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and determining appropriate valuation adjustments related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality. Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence. Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in control and support functions that are independent of the revenue producing units (independent control and support functions). This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 45 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Price Verification. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent control and support functions include: Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations. External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., broker or dealers, MarkIt, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. Calibration to Market Comparables. Market based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. Relative Value Analyses. Market based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. Collateral Analyses. Margin disputes on derivatives are examined and investigated to determine the impact, if any, on our valuations. Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market clearing levels. Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. See Notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about fair value measurements. Review of Net Revenues. Independent control and support functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified. Review of Valuation Models. Quantitative professionals within our Market Risk Management department (Market Risk Management) perform an independent model approval process. This process incorporates a review of a diverse set of model and trade parameters across a broad range of values (including extreme and or improbable conditions) in order to critically evaluate: the models suitability for valuation and risk management of a particular instrument type; the models accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; the suitability and properties of the numerical algorithms incorporated in the model; the models consistency with models for similar products; and the models sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. New or changed models are reviewed and approved. Models are evaluated and re approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. 46 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Level 3 Financial Assets at Fair Value. The table below presents financial assets measured at fair value and the amount of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Total level 3 financial assets were $47.94 billion and $45.38 billion as of December 2011 and December 2010, respectively. See Notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about changes in level 3 financial assets and fair value measurements.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value. We derive the fair value based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use (i.e., observable price to earnings multiples and price to book multiples). We derive the net book value by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each reporting unit. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments. Critical inputs include (i) projected earnings, (ii) estimated long term growth rates and (iii) cost of equity. During the second half of 2011, consistent with the decline in stock prices in the broader financial services sector, our stock price declined and throughout most of this period, our market capitalization was below book value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The estimated fair value of our reporting units in which we hold substantially all of our goodwill significantly exceeded the estimated carrying values. We believe that it is appropriate to consider market capitalization, among other factors, as an indicator of fair value over a reasonable period of time. If the current economic market conditions persist and if there is a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment and financial markets, our earnings may be adversely affected, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. In addition, significant changes to other critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., cost of equity) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information about amendments to the accounting guidance for goodwill impairment testing and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the carrying value of our goodwill. Identifiable Intangible Assets. We amortize our identifiable intangible assets (i) over their estimated lives, (ii) based on economic usage or (iii) in proportion to estimated gross profits or premium revenues. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets or asset groups carrying value may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the carrying value and estimated remaining lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class and impairments of our identifiable intangible assets. A prolonged period of market weakness could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets. In addition, certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets, including (i) decreases in revenues from commodity related customer contracts and relationships, (ii) decreases in cash receipts from television broadcast royalties, (iii) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or (iv) adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life insurance business. Management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangibles for impairment if required. 48 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Use of Estimates The use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements, and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for losses that may arise from litigation, regulatory proceedings and tax audits. We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In accounting for income taxes, we estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 740. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about accounting for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on certain judicial, regulatory and legal proceedings. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 49 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Results of Operations The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses below and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a further discussion of the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Net Revenues 2011 versus 2010. Net revenues were $28.81 billion for 2011, 26% lower than 2010, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Investing & Lending and Institutional Client Services, as well as lower net revenues in Investment Banking. Net revenues in Investment Management were essentially unchanged compared with 2010. 2010 versus 2009. Net revenues were $39.16 billion for 2010, 13% lower than 2009, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Institutional Client Services and slightly lower net revenues in Investment Banking. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Investing & Lending and higher net revenues in Investment Management. Net Interest Income 2011 versus 2010. Net interest income was $5.19 billion for 2011, 6% lower than 2010. The decrease compared with 2010 was primarily due to higher interest expense related to our long term borrowings and higher dividend expense related to financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, partially offset by an increase in interest income from higher yielding collateralized agreements. 2010 versus 2009. Net interest income was $5.50 billion for 2010, 26% lower than 2009. The decrease compared with 2009 was primarily due to lower average fixed income assets, most notably U.S. federal agency obligations, higher interest expense related to our long term borrowings and tighter securities lending spreads. Non interest Revenues Investment banking Investment banking revenues reflected an operating environment generally characterized by significant declines in industry wide underwriting and mergers and acquisitions activity levels during the second half of 2011. These declines reflected increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies, including heightened European sovereign debt risk, which contributed to a significant widening in credit spreads, a sharp increase in volatility levels and a significant decline in global equity markets during the second half of 2011. If these concerns continue or if equity markets decline further, resulting in lower levels of client activity, revenues in investment banking would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 2011 versus 2010. Investment banking revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings were $4.36 billion for 2011, 9% lower than 2010, primarily reflecting lower revenues in our underwriting business. Revenues in equity underwriting were significantly lower than 2010, principally due to a decline in industry wide activity. Revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with 2010. Revenues in financial advisory decreased slightly compared with 2010. 2010 versus 2009. Investment banking revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings were $4.81 billion for 2010, 3% lower than 2009, reflecting lower revenues in our underwriting business, partially offset by higher revenues in financial advisory. The decline in underwriting reflected lower revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in client activity in comparison to 2009, which included significant capital raising activity by financial institution clients. Revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with 2009. Revenues in financial advisory increased compared with 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in client activity. Investment management During the first half of 2011, investment management revenues reflected an operating environment generally characterized by improved asset prices and a shift in investor assets away from money markets in favor of asset classes with potentially higher risk and returns. However, during the second half of 2011, asset prices declined, particularly in equities, in part driven by increased uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. Declining asset prices and economic uncertainty contributed to investors shifting assets away from asset classes with potentially higher risk and returns to asset classes with lower risk and returns. If asset prices continue to decline or investors continue to favor lower risk asset classes or withdraw their assets, investment management revenues would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 2011 versus 2010. Investment management revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings were $4.69 billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, offset by lower incentive fees. 52 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis 2010 versus 2009. Investment management revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings were $4.67 billion for 2010, 10% higher than 2009, primarily reflecting higher incentive fees across our alternative investment products. Management and other fees also increased, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as the impact of appreciation in the value of client assets. Commissions and fees Broad market concerns and uncertainties that emerged during 2010, including concerns about European sovereign debt risk and the weakened state of global economies, heightened during 2011. These concerns and uncertainties resulted in an increase in average volatility levels and significantly lower equity prices in Europe and Asia, particularly during the third quarter of 2011. The macro challenges during the year resulted in volatile markets, which contributed to higher transaction volumes and fees. If these concerns and uncertainties continue, but were to result in lower transaction volumes, commissions and fees would likely be negatively impacted. 2011 versus 2010. Commissions and fees on the consolidated statement of earnings were $3.77 billion for 2011, 6% higher than 2010, reflecting higher transaction volumes, particularly during the third quarter of 2011. 2010 versus 2009. Commissions and fees on the consolidated statement of earnings were $3.57 billion for 2010, 7% lower than 2009, primarily reflecting lower client activity levels. Market making During 2011, market making revenues were negatively impacted by increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies, including heightened European sovereign debt risk, and its impact on the European banking system and global financial institutions. These conditions also impacted expectations for economic prospects in the U.S. and were reflected in equity and debt markets more broadly. In addition, the downgrade in credit ratings of the U.S. government and federal agencies and many financial institutions during the second half of 2011 contributed to further uncertainty in the markets. These concerns, as well as other broad market concerns, such as uncertainty over financial regulatory reform, continued to have a negative impact on market making revenues during 2011. If these concerns continue, and market making conditions remain challenging, market making revenues would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 2011 versus 2010. Market making revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings were $9.29 billion for 2011, 32% lower than 2010. Although activity levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels, and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011, the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty, resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads, which contributed to difficult market making conditions and led to reductions in risk by us and our clients. As a result of these conditions, revenues across most of our major market making activities were lower during 2011 compared with 2010. 2010 versus 2009. Market making revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings were $13.68 billion for 2010, 38% lower than 2009. During 2010, market making revenues were negatively impacted by lower client activity levels, which reflected broad market concerns including European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, as well as tighter bid/offer spreads. The decrease in revenues compared with a particularly strong 2009 primarily reflected lower results across most of our major market making activities. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in mortgages, as 2009 included significant losses related to commercial mortgage loans. Other principal transactions During 2011, other principal transactions results reflected an operating environment characterized by a significant decline in equity markets in Europe and Asia, and unfavorable credit markets that were negatively impacted by increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies, including heightened European sovereign debt risk. If equity markets decline further and credit spreads widen further, other principal transactions revenues would likely continue to be negatively impacted. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 53 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis 2011 versus 2010. Other principal transactions revenues on the consolidated statements of earnings were $1.51 billion and $6.93 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Results for 2011 included a loss from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC and net gains from other investments in equities, primarily in private equity positions, partially offset by losses from public equities. In addition, revenues in other principal transactions included net losses from debt securities and loans, primarily reflecting approximately $1 billion of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities, including the effect of hedges, partially offset by net gains from other debt securities and loans. Results for 2011 also included revenues related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. 2010 versus 2009. Other principal transactions revenues on the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.93 billion and $2.62 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010, an increase in global equity markets and tighter credit spreads provided a favorable backdrop for other principal transactions revenues. Results for 2010 included a gain from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, net gains from other investments in equities, net gains from debt securities and loans and revenues related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Results for 2009 included a gain from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, net gains from debt securities and loans, and revenues related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes, partially offset by net losses from other investments in equities. During 2009, continued weakness in commercial real estate markets negatively impacted our results. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share based compensation programs and the external environment. In the context of more difficult economic and financial conditions, the firm launched an initiative during the second quarter of 2011 to identify areas where we can operate more efficiently and reduce our operating expenses. We targeted approximately $1.4 billion in annual run rate compensation and non compensation reductions and will continue to monitor our expense run rate closely and make further adjustments as needed. 54 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The table below presents our operating expenses and total staff.

Revenues related to our insurance activities are included in Market making on the consolidated statements of earnings. 2. Includes employees, consultants and temporary staff. 3. Compensation and benefits and non compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes are included in their respective line items in the consolidated statements of earnings. Consolidated entities held for investment purposes are entities that are held strictly for capital appreciation, have a defined exit strategy and are engaged in activities that are not closely related to our principal businesses. 2011 versus 2010. Operating expenses were $22.64 billion for 2011, 14% lower than 2010. Compensation and benefits expenses were $12.22 billion for 2011, a 21% decline compared with $15.38 billion for 2010. The ratio of compensation to net revenues for 2011 was 42.4%, compared with 39.3% 1 (which excludes the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax) for 2010. Operating expenses for 2010 included $465 million related to the U.K. bank payroll tax. Total staff decreased 7% during 2011. Total staff including consolidated entities held for investment purposes decreased 10% during 2011. 1. We believe that presenting our ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues excluding the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax is meaningful, as excluding it increases the comparability of period to period results. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues excluding the impact of this item is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents the calculation of the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues including and excluding the impact of this item. $ in millions Year Ended December 2010 Compensation and benefits (which excludes the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax) $15,376 Ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues 39.3 % Compensation and benefits, including the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax $15,841 Ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, including the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax 40.5 % Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 55 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Non compensation expenses were $10.42 billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010. Non compensation expenses for 2011 included higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, increased reserves related to our insurance business and higher market development expenses compared with 2010. These increases were offset by lower other expenses during 2011. The decrease in other expenses primarily reflected lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings (2010 included $550 million related to a settlement with the SEC). In addition, non compensation expenses during 2011 included impairment charges of approximately $440 million, primarily related to consolidated investments and Litton Loan Servicing LP. Charitable contributions were $163 million during 2011, primarily including $78 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised fund, and $25 million to The Goldman Sachs Foundation. Compensation was reduced to fund the charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. The $78 million contribution is in addition to prior year contributions made to Goldman Sachs Gives. The firm asks its participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution. 2010 versus 2009. Operating expenses were $26.27 billion for 2010, 4% higher than 2009. Compensation and benefits expenses were $15.38 billion for 2010, a 5% decline compared with $16.19 billion for 2009, due to lower net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2010 was 39.3% (which excludes the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax), compared with 35.8% for 2009. Total staff increased 10% during 2010. Total staff including consolidated entities held for investment purposes increased 7% during 2010. During 2010, the United Kingdom enacted legislation that imposed a non deductible 50% tax on certain financial institutions in respect of discretionary bonuses in excess of &pound;25,000 awarded under arrangements made between December 9, 2009 and April 5, 2010 to relevant banking employees. Our operating expenses for 2010 included $465 million related to this tax. Non compensation expenses were $10.43 billion for 2010, 14% higher than 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $682 million (including $550 million related to a settlement with the SEC), and an impairment of our NYSE DMM rights of $305 million, each during 2010. The remainder of the increase compared with 2009 generally reflected higher professional fees, market development expenses and occupancy expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of significantly higher real estate impairment charges during 2009 related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes, as well as higher charitable contributions during 2009. The real estate impairment charges, which were measured based on discounted cash flow analyses, are included in our Investing & Lending segment and reflected weakness in the commercial real estate markets. Charitable contributions were approximately $420 million during 2010, primarily including $25 million to The Goldman Sachs Foundation and $320 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised fund. Compensation was reduced to fund the charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. 56 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Provision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 28.0%, down from 35.2% for 2010. Excluding the impact of the $465 million U.K. bank payroll tax and the $550 million SEC settlement, substantially all of which was non deductible, the effective income tax rate for 2010 was 32.7% 1. The decrease from 32.7% to 28.0% was primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of earnings and the earnings mix. The effective income tax rate for 2010 of 32.7% 1 was essentially unchanged from the effective income tax rate for 2009 of 32.5%. In December 2010, the rules related to the deferral of U.S. tax on certain non repatriated active financing income were extended retroactively to January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011. If these rules are not extended, the expiration may materially increase our effective income tax rate beginning in 2013. 1. We believe that presenting our effective income tax rate for 2010 excluding the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax and the SEC settlement, substantially all of which was non deductible, is meaningful as excluding these items increases the comparability of period to period results. The effective income tax rate excluding the impact of these items is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies.

See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our business segments. The cost drivers of Goldman Sachs taken as a whole compensation, headcount and levels of business activity are broadly similar in each of our business segments. Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of Goldman Sachs as well as the performance of individual businesses.

Excludes leveraged loans. 2011 versus 2010. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $4.36 billion for 2011, 9% lower than 2010. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $1.99 billion, 4% lower than 2010. Net revenues in our Underwriting business were $2.37 billion, 14% lower than 2010, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in industry wide activity. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with 2010. Investment Banking operated in an environment generally characterized by significant declines in industry wide underwriting and mergers and acquisitions activity levels during the second half of 2011. These declines reflected increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies, including heightened European sovereign debt risk, which contributed to a significant widening in credit spreads, a sharp increase in volatility levels and a significant decline in global equity markets during the second half of 2011. If these concerns continue or if equity markets decline further, resulting in lower levels of client activity, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely continue to be negatively impacted. Our investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of 2010. The increase compared with the end of 2010 was due to an increase in potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily reflecting an increase in client mandates to underwrite initial public offerings. Estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions decreased slightly compared with the end of 2010. Estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions were essentially unchanged compared with the end of 2010. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 59 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the timeframe for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time and others may enter and leave within the same reporting period. In addition, our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur. Operating expenses were $2.96 billion for 2011, 16% lower than 2010, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, primarily resulting from lower net revenues. Pre tax earnings were $1.39 billion in 2011, 7% higher than 2010. 2010 versus 2009. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $4.81 billion for 2010, 3% lower than 2009. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $2.06 billion, 9% higher than 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in client activity. Net revenues in our Underwriting business were $2.75 billion, 11% lower than 2009, reflecting lower net revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in client activity in comparison to 2009, which included significant capital raising activity by financial institution clients. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with 2009. During 2010, Investment Banking operated in an environment generally characterized by a continuation of low levels of industry wide mergers and acquisitions activity, reflecting heightened uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. Although certain additional unfavorable market conditions emerged in the first half of 2010, including lower equity prices and wider corporate credit spreads, interest rates remained low throughout the year and underwriting activity improved during the second half of the year as global equity prices recovered and corporate credit spreads narrowed. Our investment banking transaction backlog decreased compared with the end of 2009. The decrease compared with the end of 2009 reflected a decline in estimated net revenues from potential debt and equity underwriting transactions, primarily related to client mandates to underwrite leveraged finance transactions and common stock offerings. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions. Operating expenses were $3.51 billion for 2010, essentially unchanged from 2009. Pre tax earnings were $1.30 billion in 2010, 14% lower than 2009. Institutional Client Services Our Institutional Client Services segment is comprised of: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution. Includes client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities. We generate market making revenues in these activities, in three ways: In large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury bills, large capitalization S&P 500 stocks or certain mortgage pass through certificates), we execute a high volume of transactions for our clients for modest spreads and fees. In less liquid markets (such as mid cap corporate bonds, growth market currencies and certain non agency mortgage backed securities), we execute transactions for our clients for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger. We also structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor made products that address our clients risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline). Given the focus on the mortgage market, our mortgage activities are further described below. Our activities in mortgages include commercial mortgage related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency issued collateralized mortgage obligations, other prime, subprime and Alt A securities and loans), and other asset backed securities, loans and derivatives. 60 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis We buy, hold and sell long and short mortgage positions, primarily for market making for our clients. Our inventory therefore changes based on client demands and is generally held for short term periods. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information about exposure to mortgage repurchase requests, mortgage rescissions and mortgage related litigation. Equities. Includes client execution activities related to making markets in equity products, as well as commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Equities also includes our securities services business, which provides financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees, and revenues related to our insurance activities. The table below presents the operating results of our Institutional Client Services segment. Year Ended December in millions 2011 2010 2009 Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution $ 9,018 $ 13,707 $ 21,883 Equities client execution 3,031 3,231 5,237 Commissions and fees 3,633 3,426 3,680 Securities services 1,598 1,432 1,919 Total Equities 8,262 8,089 10,836 Total net revenues 17,280 21,796 32,719 Operating expenses 12,697 14,291 13,691 Pre tax earnings $ 4,583 $ 7,505 $ 19,028 2011 versus 2010. Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $17.28 billion for 2011, 21% lower than 2010. Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $9.02 billion for 2011, 34% lower than 2010. Although activity levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels, and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011, the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty, resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads, which contributed to difficult market making conditions and led to reductions in risk by us and our clients. As a result of these conditions, net revenues across the franchise were lower, including significant declines in mortgages and credit products, compared with 2010. Net revenues in Equities were $8.26 billion for 2011, 2% higher than 2010. During 2011, average volatility levels increased and equity prices in Europe and Asia declined significantly, particularly during the third quarter. The increase in net revenues reflected higher commissions and fees, primarily due to higher transaction volumes, particularly during the third quarter of 2011. In addition, net revenues in securities services increased compared with 2010, reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances. Equities client execution net revenues were lower than 2010, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in shares. The net gain attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $596 million and $198 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Institutional Client Services operated in an environment generally characterized by increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies, including heightened European sovereign debt risk, and its impact on the European banking system and global financial institutions. These conditions also impacted expectations for economic prospects in the U.S. and were reflected in equity and debt markets more broadly. In addition, the downgrade in credit ratings of the U.S. government and federal agencies and many financial institutions during the second half of 2011 contributed to further uncertainty in the markets. These concerns, as well as other broad market concerns, such as uncertainty over financial regulatory reform, continued to have a negative impact on our net revenues during 2011. If these concerns continue, and market making conditions remain challenging, net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and Equities would likely continue to be negatively impacted. Operating expenses were $12.70 billion for 2011, 11% lower than 2010, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, primarily resulting from lower net revenues, the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax during 2010, as well as an impairment of our NYSE DMM rights of $305 million during 2010. These decreases were partially offset by higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting higher transaction volumes in Equities. Pre tax earnings were $4.58 billion in 2011, 39% lower than 2010. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 61 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis 2010 versus 2009. Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $21.80 billion for 2010, 33% lower than 2009. Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $13.71 billion for 2010, 37% lower than a particularly strong 2009. During 2010, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment characterized by lower client activity levels, which reflected broad market concerns including European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, as well as tighter bid/offer spreads. The decrease in net revenues compared with 2009 primarily reflected significantly lower results in interest rate products, credit products, commodities and, to a lesser extent, currencies. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in mortgages, as 2009 included approximately $1 billion of losses related to commercial mortgage loans. Net revenues in Equities were $8.09 billion for 2010, 25% lower than 2009, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, principally due to significantly lower results in derivatives and shares. Commissions and fees were also lower than 2009, primarily reflecting lower client activity levels. In addition, securities services net revenues were significantly lower compared with 2009, primarily reflecting tighter securities lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances. During 2010, although equity markets were volatile during the first half of the year, equity prices generally improved and volatility levels declined in the second half of the year. The net gain/(loss) attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $198 million and $(1.10) billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Results in Institutional Client Services for 2010 were negatively impacted by a general decrease in client activity levels from very strong levels seen in 2009. Certain unfavorable conditions emerged during the second quarter of 2010 that made the environment more challenging for our businesses, resulting in lower client activity levels. These conditions included broad market concerns, such as European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty regarding financial regulatory reform, sharply higher equity volatility levels, lower global equity prices and wider corporate credit spreads. During the second half of 2010, some of these conditions reversed as equity volatility levels decreased, global equity prices recovered, corporate credit spreads narrowed and commercial real estate asset prices began to improve. However, lower client activity levels, reflecting broad market concerns, including European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, continued to negatively impact our results. In addition, bid/offer spreads remained tight relative to 2009, as financial markets continued to stabilize, the availability of funding improved and volatility levels in both corporate credit spreads and commodity prices declined. Operating expenses were $14.29 billion for 2010, 4% higher than 2009, due to the impact of the U.K. bank payroll tax, as well as an impairment of our NYSE DMM rights of $305 million. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses, resulting from lower levels of discretionary compensation. Pre tax earnings were $7.51 billion in 2010, 61% lower than 2009. Investing & Lending Investing & Lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans to provide financing to clients. These investments and loans are typically longer term in nature. We make investments, directly and indirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities, loans, public and private equity securities, real estate, consolidated investment entities and power generation facilities. The table below presents the operating results of our Investing & Lending segment. Year Ended December in millions 2011 2010 2009 ICBC $ (517 ) $ 747 $ 1,582 Equity securities (excluding ICBC) 1,120 2,692 (596 ) Debt securities and loans 96 2,597 1,045 Other 1 1,443 1,505 832 Total net revenues 2,142 7,541 2,863 Operating expenses 2,673 3,361 3,523 Pre tax earnings/(loss) $ (531 ) $ 4,180 $ (660 ) 1. Primarily includes net revenues related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. 62 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis 2011 versus 2010. Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $2.14 billion and $7.54 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, Investing & Lending results reflected an operating environment characterized by a significant decline in equity markets in Europe and Asia, and unfavorable credit markets that were negatively impacted by increased concerns regarding the weakened state of global economies, including heightened European sovereign debt risk. Results for 2011 included a loss of $517 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC and net gains of $1.12 billion from other investments in equities, primarily in private equity positions, partially offset by losses from public equities. In addition, Investing & Lending included net revenues of $96 million from debt securities and loans. This amount includes approximately $1 billion of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities, including the effect of hedges, offset by net interest income and net gains from other debt securities and loans. Results for 2011 also included other net revenues of $1.44 billion, principally related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. If equity markets decline further and credit spreads widen further, net revenues in Investing & Lending would likely continue to be negatively impacted. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion for 2011, 20% lower than 2010, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, primarily resulting from lower net revenues. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of impairment charges related to consolidated investments during 2011. Pre tax loss was $531 million in 2011, compared with pre tax earnings of $4.18 billion in 2010. 2010 versus 2009. Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $7.54 billion and $2.86 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Results for 2010 included a gain of $747 million from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net gain of $2.69 billion from other investments in equities, a net gain of $2.60 billion from debt securities and loans and other net revenues of $1.51 billion, principally related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes. The net gain from other investments in equities was primarily driven by an increase in global equity markets, which resulted in appreciation of both our public and private equity positions and provided favorable conditions for initial public offerings. The net gains and net interest from debt securities and loans primarily reflected the impact of tighter credit spreads and favorable credit markets during the year, which provided favorable conditions for borrowers to refinance. Results for 2009 included a gain of $1.58 billion from our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a net gain of $1.05 billion from debt securities and loans, and other net revenues of $832 million, principally related to our consolidated entities held for investment purposes, partially offset by a net loss of $596 million from other investments in equities. During 2009, continued weakness in commercial real estate markets negatively impacted our results. Operating expenses were $3.36 billion for 2010, 5% lower than 2009, due to the impact of significantly higher real estate impairment charges during 2009 related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes, as well as decreased compensation and benefits expenses, resulting from lower levels of discretionary compensation. Pre tax earnings were $4.18 billion in 2010, compared with a pre tax loss of $660 million for 2009. Investment Management Investment Management provides investment management services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and individual clients. Investment Management also offers wealth advisory services, including portfolio management and financial counseling, and brokerage and other transaction services to high net worth individuals and families. Assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage of net asset value, which vary by asset class and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and redemptions. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds return or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Incentive fees are recognized when all material contingencies are resolved. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 63 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. Assets under management do not include the self directed assets of our clients, including brokerage accounts, or interest bearing deposits held through our bank depository institution subsidiaries.

Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.03 billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, offset by lower incentive fees. During the year, assets under management decreased $12 billion to $828 billion, reflecting net outflows of $17 billion, partially offset by net market appreciation of $5 billion. Net outflows primarily reflected outflows in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by inflows in money market assets. During the first half of 2011, Investment Management operated in an environment generally characterized by improved asset prices and a shift in investor assets away from money markets in favor of asset classes with potentially higher risk and returns. However, during the second half of 2011, asset prices declined, particularly in equities, in part driven by increased uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. Declining asset prices and economic uncertainty contributed to investors shifting assets away from asset classes with potentially higher risk and returns to asset classes with lower risk and returns. If asset prices continue to decline or investors continue to favor lower risk asset classes or withdraw their assets, net revenues in Investment Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted. Operating expenses were $4.02 billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010. Pre tax earnings were $1.02 billion in 2011, 6% higher than 2010. 64 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis 2010 versus 2009. Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.01 billion for 2010, 9% higher than 2009, primarily reflecting higher incentive fees across our alternative investment products. Management and other fees also increased, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as the impact of appreciation in the value of client assets. During 2010, assets under management decreased 4% to $840 billion, primarily reflecting outflows in money market assets, consistent with industry trends. During 2010, Investment Management operated in an environment generally characterized by a continuation of industry trends that emerged during 2009, as financial markets began to stabilize, asset prices improved and investors began to shift assets away from money markets in favor of asset classes with potentially higher risk and returns. This trend resulted in favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as appreciation in the value of client assets. Operating expenses were $4.05 billion for 2010, 10% higher than 2009, primarily reflecting increased staff levels and the impact of growth initiatives. Pre tax earnings were $963 million in 2010, 3% higher than 2009. Geographic Data See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a summary of our total net revenues, pre tax earnings and net earnings by geographic region. Regulatory Developments The U.S. Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act), enacted in July 2010, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate. The implications of the Dodd Frank Act for our businesses will depend to a large extent on the rules that will be adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other agencies to implement the legislation, as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by the legislation and the implementing rules. Similar reforms are being considered by other regulators and policy makers worldwide and these reforms may affect our businesses. We expect that the principal areas of impact from regulatory reform for us will be: the Dodd Frank prohibition on proprietary trading and the limitation on the sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities, including bank holding companies, referred to as the Volcker Rule; increased regulation of and restrictions on over the counter (OTC) derivatives markets and transactions; and increased regulatory capital requirements. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 65 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis In October 2011, the proposed rules to implement the Volcker Rule were issued and included an extensive request for comments on the proposal. The proposed rules are highly complex and many aspects of the Volcker Rule remain unclear. The full impact of the rule will depend upon the detailed scope of the prohibitions, permitted activities, exceptions and exclusions, and the full impact on the firm will not be known with certainty until the rules are finalized. While many aspects of the Volcker Rule remain unclear, we evaluated the prohibition on proprietary trading and determined that businesses that engage in bright line proprietary trading are most likely to be prohibited. In 2011 and 2010, we liquidated substantially all of our Principal Strategies and global macro proprietary trading positions. In addition, we evaluated the limitations on sponsorship of, and investments in, hedge funds and private equity funds. The firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services from private equity and hedge funds, which are included in our Investment Management segment. The firm also makes investments in funds and the gains and losses from such investments are included in our Investing & Lending segment; these gains and losses will be impacted by the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule limitation on investments in hedge funds and private equity funds requires the firm to reduce its investment in each private equity and hedge fund to 3% or less of net asset value, and to reduce the firms aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of the firms Tier 1 capital. Over the period from 1999 through 2011, the firms aggregate net revenues from its investments in hedge funds and private equity funds were not material to the firms aggregate total net revenues over the same period. We continue to manage our existing private equity funds taking into account the transition periods under the Volcker Rule. With respect to our hedge funds, we currently plan to comply with the Volcker Rule by redeeming certain of our interests in the funds. We currently expect to redeem up to approximately 10% of certain hedge funds total redeemable units per quarter over ten consecutive quarters, beginning March 2012 and ending June 2014. In addition, we have limited the firms initial investment to 3% for certain new funds. As required by the Dodd Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC have jointly issued a rule requiring each bank holding company with over $50 billion in assets and each designated systemically important financial institution to provide to regulators an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). Our resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. The regulators joint rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of the companys material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. We have commenced work on our first resolution plan, which we must submit to the regulators by July 1, 2012. GS Bank USA is also required by the FDIC to submit a plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure by July 1, 2012. In September 2011, the SEC proposed rules to implement the Dodd Frank Acts prohibition against securitization participants engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with an investor in a securitization transaction. The proposed rules would except bona fide market making activities and risk mitigating hedging activities in connection with securitization activities from the general prohibition. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve Board proposed regulations designed to strengthen the regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms. These proposals address risk based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, stress tests, single counterparty limits and early remediation requirements that are designed to address financial weakness at an early stage. Although many of the proposals mirror initiatives to which bank holding companies are already subject, their full impact on the firm will not be known with certainty until the rules are finalized. 66 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis In addition, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued revised proposals to modify their market risk regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations in the United States that have significant trading activities. The modifications are designed to address the adjustments to the market risk framework that were announced by the Basel Committee in June 2010 (Basel 2.5), as well as the prohibition on the use of credit ratings, as required by the Dodd Frank Act. We expect the federal banking agencies to propose further modifications to their capital adequacy regulations to address both Basel 3 and other aspects of the Dodd Frank Act, including requirements for global systemically important banks. Once implemented, it is likely that these changes will result in increased capital requirements, although their full impact will not be known until the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies publish their final rules. The Dodd Frank Act also establishes a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection having broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services, and this Bureau has oversight over certain of our products and services. See Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K for more information. Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Balance Sheet Management One of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) our ability to access stable funding sources and (iii) the amount of equity capital we hold. Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day to day basis, our total assets and adjusted assets at quarterly and year end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods. In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include: quarterly planning; business specific limits; monitoring of key metrics; and scenario analyses. Quarterly Planning. We prepare a quarterly balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources and capital levels for the upcoming quarter. The objectives of this quarterly planning process are: to develop our near term balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected client driven and firm driven activity levels; to ensure that our projected assets are supported by an adequate amount and tenor of funding and that our projected capital and liquidity metrics are within management guidelines; and to allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in the context of the firms overall balance sheet constraints. These constraints include the firms liability profile and equity capital levels, maturities and plans for new debt and equity issuances, share repurchases, deposit trends and secured funding transactions. To prepare our quarterly balance sheet plan, business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions meet with business managers to review current and prior period metrics and discuss expectations for the upcoming quarter. The specific metrics reviewed include asset and liability size and composition, aged inventory, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. Our consolidated quarterly plan, including our balance sheet plans by business, funding and capital projections, and projected capital and liquidity metrics, is reviewed by the Finance Committee. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 67 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Business Specific Limits. The Finance Committee sets asset and liability limits for each business and aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among business managers and managers in our independent control and support functions on a routine basis. The Finance Committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits on a quarterly basis and may also approve changes in limits on an ad hoc basis in response to changing business needs or market conditions. Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, aged inventory, limit utilization, risk measures and capital usage. We allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity as well as market fluctuations. Scenario Analyses. We conduct scenario analyses to determine how we would manage the size and composition of our balance sheet and maintain appropriate funding, liquidity and capital positions in a variety of situations: These scenarios cover short term and long term time horizons using various macro economic and firm specific assumptions. We use these analyses to assist us in developing longer term funding plans, including the level of unsecured debt issuances, the size of our secured funding program and the amount and composition of our equity capital. We also consider any potential future constraints, such as limits on our ability to grow our asset base in the absence of appropriate funding. Through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and our resolution and recovery planning, we further analyze how we would manage our balance sheet through the duration of a severe crisis and we develop plans to access funding, generate liquidity, and or redeploy equity capital, as appropriate. Balance Sheet Allocation In addition to preparing our consolidated statement of financial condition in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we prepare a balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses, which is a non GAAP presentation and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP presentations used by other companies. We believe that presenting our assets on this basis is meaningful because it is consistent with the way management views and manages risks associated with the firms assets and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of the firms assets. The table below presents a summary of this balance sheet allocation.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The following is a description of the captions in the table above. Excess Liquidity and Cash. We maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in the event of a stressed environment. See Liquidity Risk Management below for details on the composition and sizing of our excess liquidity pool or Global Core Excess (GCE). In addition to our excess liquidity, we maintain other operating cash balances, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. Secured Client Financing. We provide collateralized financing for client positions, including margin loans secured by client collateral, securities borrowed, and resale agreements primarily collateralized by government obligations. As a result of client activities, we are required to segregate cash and securities to satisfy regulatory requirements. Our secured client financing arrangements, which are generally short term, are accounted for at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value, and include daily margin requirements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Institutional Client Services. In Institutional Client Services, we maintain inventory positions to facilitate market making in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. Additionally, as part of client market making activities, we enter into resale or securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities which we can use to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. The receivables in Institutional Client Services primarily relate to securities transactions. Investing & Lending. In Investing & Lending, we make investments and originate loans to provide financing to clients. These investments and loans are typically longer term in nature. We make investments, directly and indirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities, loans, public and private equity securities, real estate and other investments. Other Assets. Other assets are generally less liquid, non financial assets, including property, leasehold improvements and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, income tax related receivables, equity method investments and miscellaneous receivables.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Less Liquid Inventory Composition We seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet comprised of assets that can be readily sold or funded on a secured basis. However, we do hold certain financial instruments that may be more difficult to sell, or fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. We focus on funding these assets with liabilities that have longer term contractual maturities to reduce the need to refinance in periods of market stress. The table below presents our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments.

Includes interests of $2.60 billion and $4.73 billion as of December 2011 and December 2010, respectively, held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. The decrease was primarily related to the sale of a portion of the ordinary shares of ICBC held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. 4. Includes interests in other investment funds that we manage. See Results of Operations Regulatory Developments for information about our plans to redeem certain of our interests in hedge funds to comply with the Volcker Rule. See Notes 4 through 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about the financial instruments we hold. Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics As of December 2011, total assets on our consolidated statement of financial condition were $923.23 billion, an increase of $11.89 billion from December 2010. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $16.22 billion, primarily due to increases in interest bearing deposits with banks, (ii) an increase in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $10.53 billion, primarily due to an increase in reserve balances held by broker dealer subsidiaries related to client activity, and (iii) an increase in financial instruments owned, at fair value of $7.25 billion, primarily due to increases in non U.S. government obligations and derivatives, partially offset by a decrease in commodities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in (i) collateralized agreements of $13.53 billion, primarily due to decreases in client and firm activity, and (ii) receivables from customers and counterparties of $7.44 billion, primarily due to decreases in client activity in secured client financing. As of December 2011, total liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition were $852.85 billion, an increase of $18.87 billion from December 2010. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in deposits of $7.54 billion, primarily due to increases in client activity and (ii) an increase in payables to customers and counterparties of $7.36 billion, primarily due to increases in client activity. As of December 2011, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $164.50 billion, which was 7% higher and 3% higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended December 2011, respectively. As of December 2011, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the quarter and year was primarily due to increases in client activity at the end of the year. As of December 2010, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $162.35 billion, which was 2% higher and 10% higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended December 2010, respectively. As of December 2010, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the quarter and year was due to an increase in client activity at the end of the year and an increase in firm financing activities. The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as U.S. government, federal agency and investment grade sovereign obligations through collateralized financing activities. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 71 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The table below presents information on our assets, unsecured long term borrowings, shareholders equity and leverage ratios. As of December $ in millions 2011 2010 Total assets $ 923,225 $ 911,332 Adjusted assets $ 604,391 $ 588,927 Unsecured long term borrowings $ 173,545 $ 174,399 Total shareholders equity $ 70,379 $ 77,356 Leverage ratio 13.1x 11.8x Adjusted leverage ratio 8.6x 7.6x Debt to equity ratio 2.5x 2.3x Adjusted assets. Adjusted assets equals total assets less (i) low risk collateralized assets generally associated with our secured client financing transactions, federal funds sold and excess liquidity (which includes financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value, less derivative liabilities) and (ii) cash and securities we segregate for regulatory and other purposes. Adjusted assets is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents the reconciliation of total assets to adjusted assets. As of December in millions 2011 2010 Total assets $ 923,225 $ 911,332 Deduct: Securities borrowed (153,341 ) (166,306 ) Securities purchased under agreements to resell and federal funds sold (187,789 ) (188,355 ) Add: Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value 145,013 140,717 Less derivative liabilities (58,453 ) (54,730 ) Subtotal (254,570 ) (268,674 ) Deduct: Cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes (64,264 ) (53,731 ) Adjusted assets $ 604,391 $ 588,927 Leverage ratio. The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt the firm is using to finance assets. This ratio is different from the Tier 1 leverage ratio included in Equity Capital Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios below, and further described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Adjusted leverage ratio. The adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by total shareholders equity. We believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital. The adjusted leverage ratio is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. Our adjusted leverage ratio increased to 8.6x as of December 2011 from 7.6x as of December 2010 as our adjusted assets increased and our total shareholders equity decreased, primarily reflecting the redemption of the firms Series G Preferred Stock and the repurchase of 47.0 million shares of our common stock. Debt to equity ratio. The debt to equity ratio equals unsecured long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity. Funding Sources Our primary sources of funding are secured financings, unsecured long term and short term borrowings, and deposits. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally. We raise funding through a number of different products, including: collateralized financings, such as repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings; long term unsecured debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and 144A medium term note programs, offshore medium term note offerings and other debt offerings; demand and savings deposits through cash sweep programs and time deposits through internal and third party broker networks; and short term unsecured debt through U.S. and non U.S. commercial paper and promissory note issuances and other methods. 72 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. Secured Funding. We fund a significant amount of our inventory on a secured basis. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding due to the nature of the collateral we post to our lenders. However, because the terms or availability of secured funding, particularly short dated funding, can deteriorate rapidly in a difficult environment, we generally do not rely on short dated secured funding unless it is collateralized with highly liquid securities such as government obligations. Substantially all of our other secured funding is executed for tenors of one month or greater. Additionally, we monitor counterparty concentration and hold a portion of our GCE for refinancing risk associated with our secured funding transactions. We seek longer terms for secured funding collateralized by lower quality assets because these funding transactions may pose greater refinancing risk. The weighted average maturity of our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by highly liquid securities eligible for inclusion in our GCE, exceeded 100 days as of December 2011. A majority of our secured funding for securities not eligible for inclusion in the GCE is executed through term repurchase agreements and securities lending contracts. We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. Unsecured Long Term Borrowings. We issue unsecured long term borrowings as a source of funding for inventory and other assets and to finance a portion of our GCE. We issue in different tenors, currencies, and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base. The table below presents our quarterly unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile through 2017 as of December 2011. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 73 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long term borrowings as of December 2011 was approximately eight years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into floating rate obligations in order to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our unsecured long term borrowings. Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). As of December 2011, we had $8.53 billion of senior unsecured short term debt outstanding guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLGP, all of which will mature on or prior to June 15, 2012. We have not issued long term debt under the TLGP since March 2009 and the program has expired for new issuances. Deposits. As of December 2011, our bank depository institution subsidiaries had $46.11 billion in customer deposits, including $13.27 billion of certificates of deposit and other time deposits with a weighted average maturity of three years, and $32.84 billion of other deposits, substantially all of which were from cash sweep programs. We utilize deposits to finance lending activities in our bank subsidiaries and to support potential outflows, such as draws on unfunded commitments. Unsecured Short Term Borrowings. A significant portion of our short term borrowings were originally long term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use short term borrowings to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. We primarily issue commercial paper, promissory notes, and other hybrid instruments. As of December 2011, our unsecured short term borrowings, including the current portion of unsecured long term borrowings, were $49.04 billion. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our unsecured short term borrowings. GS Bank USA has access to funding through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. While we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing, we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and test discount window borrowing procedures. Equity Capital Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Our principal objective is to be conservatively capitalized in terms of the amount and composition of our equity base. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that serves as a guide to determine the amount and composition of equity capital we maintain. The level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and ICAAP, and may also be influenced by other factors such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments. In addition, we maintain a capital plan which projects sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, and a contingency capital plan which provides a framework for analyzing and responding to an actual or perceived capital shortfall. Effective December 2011, as part of the Federal Reserve Boards annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater, are required to submit annual capital plans for review by the Federal Reserve Board. The capital plans should demonstrate the ability of a bank holding company to maintain its capital ratios above minimum regulatory capital requirements and above a Tier 1 common ratio of 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressed scenarios. The purpose of the Federal Reserve Boards review is to ensure that these institutions have robust, forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As part of the capital plan review, the Federal Reserve Board evaluates an institutions plan to make capital distributions, such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock, across a range of macro economic and firm specific assumptions. The Federal Reserve Board began the annual capital plan reviews in early 2012. Our consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined by the Federal Reserve Board, as described below. Our ICAAP incorporates an internal risk based capital assessment designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, in a manner that is closely aligned with our risk management practices. Our internal risk based capital assessment is supplemented with the results of stress tests. 74 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis As of December 2011, our total shareholders equity was $70.38 billion (consisting of common shareholders equity of $67.28 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion). As of December 2010, our total shareholders equity was $77.36 billion (consisting of common shareholders equity of $70.40 billion and preferred stock of $6.96 billion). In addition, our $5.00 billion of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts qualifies as equity capital for regulatory and certain rating agency purposes. See Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios below for information regarding the impact of regulatory developments. Consolidated Regulatory Capital The Federal Reserve Board is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As a bank holding company, we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are computed in accordance with the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy regulations currently applicable to bank holding companies (which are based on the Basel 1 Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)). These capital requirements are expressed as capital ratios that compare measures of capital to risk weighted assets (RWAs). See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information regarding the firms RWAs. The firms capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Federal Reserve Board regulations require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 4% and a minimum total capital ratio of 8%. The required minimum Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital ratio in order to be considered a well capitalized bank holding company under the Federal Reserve Board guidelines are 6% and 10%, respectively. Bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels, depending on their particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that have received the highest supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board guidelines or that have implemented the Federal Reserve Boards risk based capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios The table below presents information about our regulatory capital ratios. As of December $ in millions 2011 2010 Common shareholders equity $ 67,279 $ 70,399 Less: Goodwill (3,802 ) (3,495 ) Less: Disallowable intangible assets (1,666 ) (2,027 ) Less: Other deductions 1 (6,649 ) (5,601 ) Tier 1 Common Capital 55,162 59,276 Preferred stock 3,100 6,957 Junior subordinated debt issued to trusts 5,000 5,000 Tier 1 Capital 63,262 71,233 Qualifying subordinated debt 2 13,828 13,880 Other adjustments 53 (220 ) Tier 2 Capital 13,881 13,660 Total Capital $ 77,143 $ 84,893 Risk Weighted Assets 3 $ 457,027 $ 444,290 Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.8 % 16.0 % Total Capital Ratio 16.9 % 19.1 % Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 3 7.0 % 8.0 % Tier 1 Common Ratio 4 12.1 % 13.3 % 1. Principally includes equity investments in non financial companies and the cumulative change in the fair value of our unsecured borrowings attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads, disallowed deferred tax assets, and investments in certain nonconsolidated entities. 2. Substantially all of our subordinated debt qualifies as Tier 2 capital for Basel 1 purposes. 3. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information about the firms RWAs and Tier 1 leverage ratio. 4. The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 common capital divided by RWAs. We believe that the Tier 1 common ratio is meaningful because it is one of the measures that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and, while not currently a formal regulatory capital ratio, this measure is of increasing importance to regulators. The Tier 1 common ratio is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. Our Tier 1 capital ratio decreased to 13.8% as of December 2011 from 16.0% as of December 2010. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 7.0% as of December 2011 from 8.0% as of December 2010. These decreases reflected a reduction in our Tier 1 capital primarily due to the impact of the redemption of the firms Series G Preferred Stock and the repurchase of 47.0 million shares of our common stock, partially offset by net earnings. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 75 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis We are currently working to implement the requirements set out in the Federal Reserve Boards Risk Based Capital Standards: Advanced Capital Adequacy Framework Basel 2, as applicable to us as a bank holding company (Basel 2), which are based on the advanced approaches under the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee. U.S. banking regulators have incorporated the Basel 2 framework into the existing risk based capital requirements by requiring that internationally active banking organizations, such as us, adopt Basel 2, once approved to do so by regulators. As required by the Dodd Frank Act, U.S. banking regulators have adopted a rule that requires large banking organizations, upon adoption of Basel 2, to continue to calculate risk based capital ratios under both Basel 1 and Basel 2. For each of the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the lower of the Basel 1 and Basel 2 ratios calculated will be used to determine whether the bank meets its minimum risk based capital requirements. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued revised proposals to modify their market risk regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations in the United States that have significant trading activities. These modifications are designed to address the adjustments to Basel 2.5, as well as the prohibition on the use of credit ratings, as required by the Dodd Frank Act. Once implemented, it is likely that these changes will result in increased capital requirements for market risk. Additionally, the guidelines issued by the Basel Committee in December 2010 (Basel 3) revise the definition of Tier 1 capital, introduce Tier 1 common equity as a regulatory metric, set new minimum capital ratios (including a new capital conservation buffer, which must be composed exclusively of Tier 1 common equity and will be in addition to the minimum capital ratios), introduce a Tier 1 leverage ratio within international guidelines for the first time, and make substantial revisions to the computation of RWAs for credit exposures. Implementation of the new requirements is expected to take place over the next several years. Although the U.S. federal banking agencies have now issued proposed rules that are intended to implement certain aspects of the Basel 2.5 guidelines, they have not yet addressed all aspects of those guidelines or the Basel 3 changes. The Basel Committee has published its final provisions for assessing the global systemic importance of banking institutions and the range of additional Tier 1 common equity that should be maintained by banking institutions deemed to be globally systemically important. The additional capital for these institutions would initially range from 1% to 2.5% of Tier 1 common equity and could be as much as 3.5% for a bank that increases its systemic footprint (e.g., by increasing total assets). The firm was one of 29 institutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (established at the direction of the leaders of the Group of 20) as globally systemically important under the Basel Committees methodology. Therefore, depending upon the manner and timing of the U.S. banking regulators implementation of the Basel Committees methodology, we expect that the minimum Tier 1 common ratio requirement applicable to us will include this additional capital assessment. The final determination of whether an institution is classified as globally systemically important and the calculation of the required additional capital amount is expected to be disclosed by the Basel Committee no later than November 2014 based on data through the end of 2013. The Dodd Frank Act will subject us at a firmwide level to the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions and directs banking regulators to impose additional capital requirements as disclosed above. The Federal Reserve Board is expected to adopt the new leverage and risk based capital regulations in 2012. As a consequence of these changes, Tier 1 capital treatment for our junior subordinated debt issued to trusts will be phased out over a three year period beginning on January 1, 2013. The interaction among the Dodd Frank Act, the Basel Committees proposed changes and other proposed or announced changes from other governmental entities and regulators adds further uncertainty to our future capital requirements. 76 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis See Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information about our regulatory capital ratios and the related regulatory requirements. Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process We perform an ICAAP with the objective of ensuring that the firm is appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our business. As part of our ICAAP, we perform an internal risk based capital assessment. This assessment incorporates market risk, credit risk and operational risk. Market risk is calculated by using Value at Risk (VaR) calculations supplemented by risk based add ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks). Credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties probability of default, the size of our losses in the event of a default and the maturity of our counterparties contractual obligations to us. Operational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures. Backtesting is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks. We evaluate capital adequacy based on the result of our internal risk based capital assessment, supplemented with the results of stress tests which measure the firms performance under various market conditions. Our goal is to hold sufficient capital, under our internal risk based capital framework, to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and integrated into the overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework of the firm. We attribute capital usage to each of our businesses based upon our internal risk based capital and regulatory frameworks and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established. Rating Agency Guidelines The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of the firms senior unsecured obligations. Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.) and Goldman Sachs International (GSI) have been assigned long and short term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA has also been assigned long term issuer ratings as well as ratings on its long term and short term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. The level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See Liquidity Risk Management Credit Ratings for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS&Co., GSI and GS Bank USA. Subsidiary Capital Requirements Many of our subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA and our broker dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world. For purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital, GS Bank USA has established an ICAAP which is similar to that used by Group Inc. GS Bank USAs capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. We expect that the capital requirements of several of our subsidiaries will be impacted in the future by the various developments arising from the Basel Committee, the Dodd Frank Act, and other governmental entities and regulators. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information about GS Bank USAs capital ratios under Basel 1 as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, and for further information about the capital requirements of our other regulated subsidiaries and the potential impact of regulatory reform. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. In certain instances, Group Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. As of December 2011 and December 2010, Group Inc.s equity investment in subsidiaries was $67.70 billion and $71.30 billion, respectively, compared with its total shareholders equity of $70.38 billion and $77.36 billion, respectively. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 77 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of GS&Co., GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) plc and Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) subject to certain exceptions. In November 2008, Group Inc. contributed subsidiaries into GS Bank USA, and Group Inc. agreed to guarantee certain losses, including credit related losses, relating to assets held by the contributed entities. In connection with this guarantee, Group Inc. also agreed to pledge to GS Bank USA certain collateral, including interests in subsidiaries and other illiquid assets. Our capital invested in non U.S. subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non U.S. denominated debt. Contingency Capital Plan Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information as well as ensuring timely communication with external stakeholders. Equity Capital Management Our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal composition of equity capital. We principally manage our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant and subject to any regulatory approvals. We manage our capital requirements principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and or limits on risk, in each case both at the consolidated and business levels. We attribute capital usage to each of our businesses based upon our internal risk based capital and regulatory frameworks and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established. Preferred Stock. During 2011, we redeemed the 50,000 shares of our Series G Preferred Stock held by Berkshire Hathaway for the stated redemption price of $5.50 billion ($110,000 per share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In connection with this redemption, we recognized a preferred dividend of $1.64 billion (calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock), which is included in the consolidated statement of earnings for 2011. Berkshire Hathaway continues to hold a five year warrant, issued in October 2008, to purchase up to 43.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $115.00 per share. Share Repurchase Program. We seek to use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity and to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share based compensation. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open market purchases, the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital positions (i.e., comparisons of our desired level and composition of capital to our actual level and composition of capital) and the issuance of shares resulting from employee share based compensation, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. As of December 2011, under the share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board), we can repurchase up to 63.5 million additional shares of common stock; however, any such repurchases are subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5 and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for additional information on our repurchase program. See Notes 16 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt. 78 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders equity is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies.

We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders equity divided by common shares outstanding) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non GAAP measures used by other companies. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including: purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles; holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; entering into operating leases; and providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, equity, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.

Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 81 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis In the table above: Obligations maturing within one year of our financial statement date or redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holder are excluded and are treated as short term obligations. Obligations that are repayable prior to maturity at our option are reflected at their contractual maturity dates and obligations that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holders are reflected at the dates such options become exercisable. Amounts included in the table do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements for these arrangements because commitments and guarantees represent notional amounts and may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterpartys request. Due to the uncertainty of the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our unrecognized tax benefits. See Notes 15 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our short term borrowings, and commitments and guarantees. As of December 2011, our unsecured long term borrowings were $173.55 billion, with maturities extending to 2061, and consisted principally of senior borrowings. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our unsecured long term borrowings. As of December 2011, our future minimum rental payments net of minimum sublease rentals under noncancelable leases were $3.26 billion. These lease commitments, principally for office space, expire on various dates through 2069. Certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our leases. Our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements. This excess space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future. We regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels. For the year ended December 2011, total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of our current requirements were $85 million, which includes costs related to the transition to our new headquarters in New York City. In addition, for the year ended December 2011, we incurred exit costs of $14 million related to our office space. We may incur exit costs in the future to the extent we (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in the locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. These exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period. Overview and Structure of Risk Management Overview We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of the firm. Accordingly, we have comprehensive risk management processes through which we monitor, evaluate and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. These include market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risk exposures. Our risk management framework is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. Governance. Risk management governance starts with our Board, which plays an important role in reviewing and approving risk management policies and practices, both directly and through its Risk Committee, which consists of all of our independent directors. The Board also receives periodic updates on firmwide risks from our independent control and support functions. Next, at the most senior levels of the firm, our leaders are experienced risk managers, with a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the risks we take. Our senior managers lead and participate in risk oriented committees, as do the leaders of our independent control and support functions including those in internal audit, compliance, controllers, credit risk management, human capital management, legal, market risk management, operations, operational risk management, tax, technology and treasury. 82 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The firms governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk related committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to identify, manage and mitigate risks. We maintain strong communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision making among the revenue producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management. While we believe that the first line of defense in managing risk rests with the managers in our revenue producing units, we dedicate extensive resources to independent control and support functions in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. Processes. We maintain various processes and procedures that are critical components of our risk management. First and foremost is our daily discipline of marking substantially all of the firms inventory to current market levels. Goldman Sachs carries its inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our financial exposures. We also apply a rigorous framework of limits to control risk across multiple transactions, products, businesses and markets. This includes setting credit and market risk limits at a variety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis. Limits are typically set at levels that will be periodically exceeded, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk related matters. See Market Risk Management and Credit Risk Management for further information on our risk limits. Active management of our positions is another important process. Proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress. We also focus on the rigor and effectiveness of the firms risk systems. The goal of our risk management technology is to get the right information to the right people at the right time, which requires systems that are comprehensive, reliable and timely. We devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete, accurate and timely information. People. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. In both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions, the experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guide the firm in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels. Structure Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of the firms Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its Risk Committee. Within the firm, a series of committees with specific risk management mandates have oversight or decision making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub committees or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and legal entities. Membership of the firms risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members within the firm. In addition, independent control and support functions, which report to the chief financial officer, general counsel, chief administrative officer, or in the case of Internal Audit, to the Audit Committee of the Board, are responsible for day to day oversight of risk, as discussed in greater detail in the following sections. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 83 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure, highlighting the oversight of our Board, our key risk related committees and the independence of our control and support functions. Management Committee. The Management Committee oversees the global activities of the firm, including all of the firms independent control and support functions. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee is comprised of the most senior leaders of the firm, and is chaired by the firms chief executive officer. The Management Committee has established various committees with delegated authority and the chairperson of the Management Committee appoints the chairpersons of these committees. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other firmwide, divisional and regional committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management. Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. The Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee assesses and makes determinations regarding business standards and practices, reputational risk management, client relationships and client service, is chaired by the firms president and chief operating officer, and reports to the Management Committee. This committee also has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Business Standards Committee. This committee has established the following two risk related committees that report to it: 84 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Firmwide New Activity Committee. The Firmwide New Activity Committee is responsible for reviewing new activities and establishing a process to identify and review previously approved activities that are significant and that have changed in complexity and or structure or present different reputational and suitability concerns over time to consider whether these activities remain appropriate. This committee is co chaired by the firms head of operations/chief operating officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa and the chief administrative officer of our Investment Management Division who are appointed by the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee chairperson. Firmwide Suitability Committee. The Firmwide Suitability Committee is responsible for setting standards and policies for product, transaction and client suitability and providing a forum for consistency across divisions, regions and products on suitability assessments. This committee also reviews suitability matters escalated from other firm committees. This committee is co chaired by the firms international general counsel and the co head of our Investment Management Division who are appointed by the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. Firmwide Risk Committee. The Firmwide Risk Committee is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and control of the firms global financial risks. Through both direct and delegated authority, the Firmwide Risk Committee approves firmwide, product, divisional and business level limits for both market and credit risks, approves sovereign credit risk limits and reviews results of stress tests and scenario analyses. This committee is co chaired by the firms chief financial officer and a senior managing director from the firms executive office, and reports to the Management Committee. The following four committees report to the Firmwide Risk Committee, which is responsible for appointing the chairperson of each of these committees: Securities Division Risk Committee. The Securities Division Risk Committee sets market risk limits, subject to overall firmwide risk limits, for our Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and Equities Client Execution businesses based on a number of risk measures, including VaR, stress tests, scenario analyses, and inventory levels. This committee is chaired by the chief risk officer of our Securities Division. Credit Policy Committee. The Credit Policy Committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by our Credit Risk Management department (Credit Risk Management). This committee is chaired by the firms chief credit officer. Operational Risk Committee. The Operational Risk Committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies, framework and methodologies, and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management. This committee is chaired by a managing director in Credit Risk Management. Finance Committee. The Finance Committee has oversight of firmwide liquidity, the size and composition of our balance sheet and capital base, and our credit ratings. This committee regularly reviews our liquidity, balance sheet, funding position and capitalization, and makes adjustments in light of current events, risks and exposures, and regulatory requirements. This committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving balance sheet limits and the size of our GCE. This committee is co chaired by the firms chief financial officer and the firms global treasurer. The following committees report jointly to the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. Firmwide Commitments Committee. The Firmwide Commitments Committee reviews the firms underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equity related product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, this committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. This committee is co chaired by the global co head of our Financial Institutions Group for Investment Banking and the head of Mergers & Acquisitions for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific for Investment Banking who are appointed by the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee chairperson. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 85 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Firmwide Capital Committee. The Firmwide Capital Committee provides approval and oversight of debt related underwriting transactions, including related commitments of the firms capital. This committee aims to ensure that business and reputational standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. This committee is co chaired by the firms global treasurer and the head of credit finance for Europe, Middle East and Africa who are appointed by the Firmwide Risk Committee chairpersons. Investment Management Division Risk Committee. The Investment Management Division Risk Committee is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and control of global market, counterparty credit and liquidity risks associated with the activities of our investment management businesses. The head of Investment Management Division risk management is the chair of this committee. The Investment Management Division Risk Committee reports to the firms chief risk officer. Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity is of critical importance to financial institutions. Most of the recent failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Accordingly, the firm has in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events. Our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. We manage liquidity risk according to the following principles: Excess Liquidity. We maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. Asset Liability Management. We assess anticipated holding periods for our assets and their expected liquidity in a stressed environment. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain liabilities of appropriate tenor relative to our asset base. Contingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. This framework sets forth the plan of action to fund normal business activity in emergency and stress situations. These principles are discussed in more detail below. Excess Liquidity Our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund our estimated potential cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our global core excess would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of reverse repurchase agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets. As of December 2011 and December 2010, the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits included in our GCE totaled $171.58 billion and $174.78 billion, respectively. Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk model, discussed below, as well as our consideration of other factors including but not limited to a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm, we believe our liquidity position as of December 2011 was appropriate. The table below presents the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our GCE. Average for the Year Ended December in millions 2011 2010 U.S. dollar denominated $125,668 $130,072 Non U.S. dollar denominated 40,291 37,942 Total $165,959 $168,014 86 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The U.S. dollar denominated excess is composed of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and federal agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. federal agency mortgage backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits. The non U.S. dollar denominated excess is composed of only unencumbered German, French, Japanese and United Kingdom government obligations and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies. We strictly limit our excess liquidity to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity, such as lower quality unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities, in our GCE. The table below presents the fair value of our GCE by asset class. Average for the Year Ended December in millions 2011 2010 Overnight cash deposits $ 34,622 $ 25,040 Federal funds sold 75 U.S. government obligations 88,528 102,937 U.S. federal agency obligations, including highly liquid U.S. federal agency mortgage backed obligations 5,018 3,194 German, French, Japanese and United Kingdom government obligations 37,791 36,768 Total $ 165,959 $ 168,014 The GCE is held at Group Inc. and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries, as presented in the table below. Average for the Year Ended December in millions 2011 2010 Group Inc. $ 49,548 $ 53,757 Major broker dealer subsidiaries 75,086 69,223 Major bank subsidiaries 41,325 45,034 Total $ 165,959 $ 168,014 Our GCE reflects the following principles: The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a companys survival. Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. We believe that our GCE provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment. In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCE, we use an internal liquidity model, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, which captures and quantifies the firms liquidity risks. We also consider other factors including but not limited to a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm. We distribute our GCE across subsidiaries, asset types, and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. We maintain our GCE to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries. The Modeled Liquidity Outflow incorporates a consolidated requirement as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries. Liquidity held directly in each of these subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. We hold a portion of our GCE directly at Group Inc. to support consolidated requirements not accounted for in the major subsidiaries. In addition to the GCE, we maintain operating cash balances in several of our other operating entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 87 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis In addition to our GCE, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCE. The fair value of these assets averaged $83.32 billion and $72.98 billion for the years ended December 2011 and December 2010, respectively. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCE liquidity pool and therefore conservatively do not assume we will generate liquidity from these assets in our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. Modeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on a scenario that includes both a market wide stress and a firm specific stress, characterized by some or all of the following qualitative elements: Global recession, default by a medium sized sovereign, low consumer and corporate confidence, and general financial instability. Severely challenged market environment with material declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads. Damaging follow on impacts to financial institutions leading to the failure of a large bank. A firm specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive departure, and or a ratings downgrade. The following are the critical modeling parameters of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow: Liquidity needs over a 30 day scenario. A two notch downgrade of the firms long term senior unsecured credit ratings. A combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows (e.g., actions though not contractually required, we may deem necessary in a crisis). We assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis. No issuance of equity or unsecured debt. No support from government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on them as a source of funding in a liquidity crisis. No diversification benefit across liquidity risks. We assume that liquidity risks are additive. Maintenance of our normal business levels. We do not assume asset liquidation, other than the GCE. The Modeled Liquidity Outflow is calculated and reported to senior management on a daily basis. We regularly refine our model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and the firms business mix. The potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows covered in our Modeled Liquidity Outflow include: Unsecured Funding Contractual: All upcoming maturities of unsecured long term debt, commercial paper, promissory notes and other unsecured funding products. We assume that we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt. Contingent: Repurchases of our outstanding long term debt, commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as a market maker. Deposits Contractual: All upcoming maturities of term deposits. We assume that we will be unable to raise new term deposits or rollover any maturing term deposits. Contingent: Withdrawals of bank deposits that have no contractual maturity. The withdrawal assumptions reflect, among other factors, the type of deposit, whether the deposit is insured or uninsured, and the firms relationship with the depositor. Secured Funding Contractual: A portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts (i.e., on terms which require us to post additional collateral). Our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the quality of the underlying collateral and counterparty concentration. Contingent: A decline in value of financial assets pledged as collateral for financing transactions, which would necessitate additional collateral postings under those transactions. 88 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis OTC Derivatives Contingent: Collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our OTC derivatives. Contingent: Other outflows of cash or collateral related to OTC derivatives, including the impact of trade terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral disputes, collateral calls or termination payments required by a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings, and collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. Exchange Traded Derivatives Contingent: Variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange traded derivatives. Contingent: An increase in initial margin and guaranty fund requirements by derivative clearing houses. Customer Cash and Securities Contingent: Liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business, including withdrawals of customer credit balances, and a reduction in customer short positions, which serve as a funding source for long positions. Unfunded Commitments Contingent: Draws on our unfunded commitments. Draw assumptions reflect, among other things, the type of commitment and counterparty. Other Other upcoming large cash outflows, such as tax payments. Asset Liability Management Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We seek to maintain a long dated and diversified funding profile, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. Our approach to asset liability management includes: Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Funding Sources for additional details. Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and our ability to fund assets on a secured basis. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. Less liquid assets are more difficult to fund and therefore require funding of longer tenor. See Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Balance Sheet Management for more detail on our balance sheet management process. Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a sufficiently longer term than the anticipated holding period of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. Our goal is to have sufficient total capital (unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity) so that we can avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCE). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. The target amount of our total capital is based on an internal funding model which incorporates the following long term financing requirements: The portion of financial instruments owned, at fair value, that are not funded on a secured basis. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, property, leasehold improvements and equipment, and other illiquid assets. Derivative and other margin and collateral requirements. Anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments. Regulatory requirements to hold capital or other forms of financing in excess of what we would otherwise hold in regulated subsidiaries. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 89 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Subsidiary Funding Policies. The majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc. which lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including secured funding, unsecured borrowings and deposits. Our intercompany funding policies assume that, unless legally provided for, a subsidiarys funds or securities are not freely available to its parent company or other subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available until the maturity of such financing. Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2011, Group Inc. had $28.16 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker dealer; $28.43 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker dealer; $2.67 billion invested in GSEC, a U.S. registered broker dealer; $4.28 billion invested in Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd., a regulated Japanese broker dealer; and $19.23 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State chartered bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $84.83 billion of unsubordinated loans and $6.12 billion of collateral to these entities, substantially all of which was to GS&Co. and GSI, as of December 2011. In addition, as of December 2011, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. Contingency Funding Plan The Goldman Sachs contingency funding plan sets out the plan of action we would use to fund business activity in crisis situations and periods of market stress. The contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail the firms potential responses if our assessments indicate that the firm has entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals to foster effective coordination, control and distribution of information, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. The contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of these groups and individuals, which include making and disseminating key decisions, coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication. 90 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, after revising its global rating methodology for banks, Standard & Poors Ratings Services lowered Group Inc.s ratings on long term debt (from A to A ), short term debt (from A 1 to A 2), subordinated debt (from A to BBB+), trust preferred (from BBB to BB+) and preferred stock (from BBB to BB+), and retained its outlook of negative. In addition, as part of a global review of financial institutions, Fitch, Inc. lowered Group Inc.s ratings on long term debt (from A+ to A), short term debt (from F1+ to F1), subordinated debt (from A to A ), trust preferred (from A to BBB+) and preferred stock (from A to BBB+), and retained its outlook of stable. On February 10, 2012, Standard & Poors Ratings Services assigned GS Bank USA, a rating of A 1 as a short term issuer and A as a long term issuer. On February 15, 2012, Moodys Investors Service placed the long and short term debt ratings of Group Inc. under review for downgrade as part of a global review of financial institutions. We rely on the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions. See Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses below and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings. We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of: our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices; the level and variability of our earnings; our capital base; our franchise, reputation and management; our corporate governance; and the external operating environment, including the assumed level of government support. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 91 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis We allocate a portion of our GCE to ensure we would be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two notch reduction in our long term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. The table below presents the additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called at the reporting date by counterparties in the event of a one notch and two notch downgrade in our credit ratings. As of December in millions 2011 2010 Additional collateral or termination payments for a one notch downgrade $ 1,303 $ 1,353 Additional collateral or termination payments for a two notch downgrade 2,183 2,781 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring calls for imposition of a liquidity coverage ratio, designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets based on expected cash outflows under an acute liquidity stress scenario, and a net stable funding ratio, designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one year time horizon. The liquidity coverage ratio is not expected to be introduced as a requirement until January 1, 2015, and the net stable funding ratio is not expected to be introduced as a requirement until January 1, 2018. While the principles behind the new framework are broadly consistent with our current liquidity management framework, it is possible that the implementation of these standards could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices. Cash Flows As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses. Year Ended December 2011. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $16.22 billion to $56.01 billion at the end of 2011. We generated $23.13 billion in net cash from operating and investing activities. We used net cash of $6.91 billion for financing activities, primarily for repurchases of our Series G Preferred Stock and common stock, partially offset by an increase in bank deposits. Year Ended December 2010. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.50 billion to $39.79 billion at the end of 2010. We generated $7.84 billion in net cash from financing activities primarily from net proceeds from issuances of short term secured financings. We used net cash of $6.34 billion for operating and investing activities, primarily to fund an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell and an increase in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes, partially offset by cash generated from a decrease in securities borrowed. Year Ended December 2009. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $24.49 billion to $38.29 billion at the end of 2009. We generated $48.88 billion in net cash from operating activities. We used net cash of $24.39 billion for investing and financing activities, primarily for net repayments in unsecured and secured short term borrowings and the repurchases of Series H Preferred Stock and the related common stock warrant from the U.S. Treasury, partially offset by an increase in bank deposits and the issuance of common stock. 92 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Market Risk Management Overview Market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory due to changes in market prices. We hold inventory primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and lending activities. Our inventory therefore changes based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Our inventory is accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily basis. Categories of market risk include the following: Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads. Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices. Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates. Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as electricity, natural gas, crude oil, petroleum products, and precious and base metals. Market Risk Management Process We manage our market risk by diversifying exposures, controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. This includes: accurate and timely exposure information incorporating multiple risk metrics; a dynamic limit setting framework; and constant communication among revenue producing units, risk managers and senior management. Market Risk Management, which is independent of the revenue producing units and reports to the firms chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing market risk at the firm. We monitor and control risks through strong firmwide oversight and independent control and support functions across the firms global businesses. Managers in revenue producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in depth knowledge of their positions, of markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. Managers in revenue producing units and Market Risk Management discuss market information, positions and estimated risk and loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Risk Measures Market Risk Management produces risk measures and monitors them against market risk limits set by our firms risk committees. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at trading desk, business and firmwide levels. We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short term and long term time horizons. Risk measures used for shorter term periods include VaR and sensitivity metrics. For longer term horizons, our primary risk measures are stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions. Systems We have made a significant investment in technology to monitor market risk including: an independent calculation of VaR and stress measures; risk measures calculated at individual position levels; attribution of risk measures to individual risk factors of each position; the ability to report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or legal entity); and the ability to produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 93 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Value at Risk VaR is the potential loss in value of inventory positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. We typically employ a one day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. The VaR model captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level. We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme. VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions. Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. When calculating VaR, we use historical simulations with full valuation of approximately 70,000 market factors. The historical data used in our VaR calculation is weighted to give greater importance to more recent observations and reflect current asset volatilities. This improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our inventory positions were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. We evaluate the accuracy of our VaR model through daily backtesting (i.e., comparing daily trading net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. Our VaR measure does not include: positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected. Stress Testing We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of significant risk exposures across the firm. We use a variety of scenarios to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on the firms portfolios. These scenarios include the default of single corporate or sovereign entities, the impact of a move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) or a combination of two or more risk factors. Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur. Instead, stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). Stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part of the firms routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. Stress testing is an important part of the firms risk management process because it allows us to highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Limits We use risk limits at various levels in the firm (including firmwide, product and business) to govern risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market risk. Limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or tolerance for risk. The Firmwide Risk Committee sets market risk limits at firmwide and product levels and our Securities Division Risk Committee sets sub limits for market making and investing activities at a business level. The purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling the firms overall risk profile. Sub limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day to day basis without additional levels of senior management approval, effectively leaving day to day trading decisions to individual desk managers and traders. Accordingly, sub limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance. Sub limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand, taking into account the relative performance of each area. 94 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Our market risk limits are monitored daily by Market Risk Management, which is responsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. The business level limits that are set by the Securities Division Risk Committee are subject to the same scrutiny and limit escalation policy as the firmwide limits. When a risk limit has been exceeded (e.g., due to changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations), it is reported to the appropriate risk committee and a discussion takes place with the relevant desk managers, after which either the risk position is reduced or the risk limit is temporarily or permanently increased. Metrics We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business, and region. The tables below present average daily VaR and year end VaR by risk category. Average Daily VaR in millions Year Ended December Risk Categories 2011 2010 2009 Interest rates $ 94 $ 93 $ 176 Equity prices 33 68 66 Currency rates 20 32 36 Commodity prices 32 33 36 Diversification effect 1 (66 ) (92 ) (96 ) Total $ 113 $ 134 $ 218 1. Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Our average daily VaR decreased to $113 million in 2011 from $134 million in 2010, primarily reflecting decreases in the equity prices and currency rates categories, principally due to reduced exposures. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the diversification benefit across risk categories. Our average daily VaR decreased to $134 million in 2010 from $218 million in 2009, principally due to a decrease in the interest rates category which was primarily due to reduced exposures, lower levels of volatility and tighter spreads. Year End VaR and High and Low VaR in millions As of December Year Ended December 2011 Risk Categories 2011 2010 High Low Interest rates $ 100 $ 78 $ 147 $ 69 Equity prices 31 51 119 14 Currency rates 14 27 31 10 Commodity prices 23 25 53 20 Diversification effect 1 (69 ) (70 ) Total $ 99 $ 111 $ 169 $ 82 1. Equals the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Our daily VaR decreased to $99 million as of December 2011 from $111 million as of December 2010, primarily reflecting decreases in the equity prices and currency rates categories, principally due to reduced exposures. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the interest rates category, primarily due to higher levels of volatility and wider credit spreads. During the year ended December 2011, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on one occasion. It was resolved by a temporary increase in the firmwide VaR risk limit, which was subsequently made permanent due to higher levels of volatility. The firmwide VaR risk limit had previously been reduced on one occasion in 2011, reflecting lower risk utilization and the market environment. During the year ended December 2010, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on one occasion in order to facilitate a client transaction and was resolved by a reduction in the risk position on the following day. Separately, during the year ended December 2010, the firmwide VaR risk limit was reduced on one occasion reflecting lower risk utilization. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 95 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The chart below reflects the VaR over the last four quarters. The chart below presents the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in VaR for the year ended December 2011. Daily trading net revenues are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. The firm incurred trading losses on a single day in excess of our 95% one day VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on three occasions during 2011 and on two occasions during 2010. 96 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis During periods in which the firm has significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. In addition, VaR backtesting is performed against total daily market making revenues, including bid/offer net revenues which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. Sensitivity Measures Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. The market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10% decline in the underlying asset value. The table below presents market risk for positions that are not included in VaR. These measures do not reflect diversification benefits across asset categories and therefore have not been aggregated. Asset Categories 10% Sensitivity Amount as of December in millions 2011 2010 ICBC 1 $ 212 $ 286 Equity (excluding ICBC) 2 2,458 2,529 Debt 3 1,521 1,655 1. Excludes third party interests held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. 2. Relates to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in firm sponsored funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in firm sponsored hedge funds. 3. Relates to corporate bank debt, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans and interests in our firm sponsored funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments. VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) on derivatives was a $4 million gain as of December 2011. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was a $7 million gain (including hedges) as of December 2011. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. The firm engages in insurance activities where we reinsure and purchase portfolios of insurance risk and pension liabilities. The risks associated with these activities include, but are not limited to: equity, interest rate, reinvestment and mortality risk. The firm mitigates risks associated with insurance activities through the use of reinsurance and hedging. Certain of the assets associated with the firms insurance activities are included in VaR. In addition to the positions included in VaR we held $4.86 billion of securities accounted for as available for sale as of December 2011, substantially all of which support the firms insurance subsidiaries. As of December 2011, our available for sale securities primarily consisted of $1.81 billion of corporate debt securities with an average yield of 5%, the majority of which will mature after five years, $1.42 billion of mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities with an average yield of 10%, the majority of which will mature after ten years, and $662 million of U.S. government and federal agency obligations with an average yield of 3%, the majority of which will mature after ten years. As of December 2010, we held $3.67 billion of securities accounted for as available for sale primarily consisting of $1.69 billion of corporate debt securities with an average yield of 6%, the majority of which will mature after five years, $670 million of mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities with an average yield of 11%, which will mature after ten years, and $637 million of U.S. government and federal agency obligations with an average yield of 4%, the majority of which will mature after ten years. In addition, as of December 2011 and December 2010, we had commitments and held loans under the William Street credit extension program. As of December 2010, we also held money market instruments under this program. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information about our William Street credit extension program. Additionally, we make investments accounted for under the equity method and we also make direct investments in real estate, both of which are included in Other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information on Other assets. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 97 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Credit Risk Management Overview Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and receivables from brokers, dealers, clearing organizations, customers and counterparties. Credit Risk Management, which is independent of the revenue producing units and reports to the firms chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing credit risk at the firm. The Credit Policy Committee and the Firmwide Risk Committee establish and review credit policies and parameters. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk Management, consistent with other inventory positions. Policies authorized by the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Credit Policy Committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for the firm to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across all product areas, taking into account any enforceable netting provisions, collateral or other credit risk mitigants. Credit Risk Management Process Effective management of credit risk requires accurate and timely information, a high level of communication and knowledge of customers, countries, industries and products. Our process for managing credit risk includes: approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits; monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits; assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; measuring the firms current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default; reporting of credit exposures to senior management, the Board and regulators; use of credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and communication and collaboration with other independent control and support functions such as operations, legal and compliance. As part of the risk assessment process, Credit Risk Management performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. A credit review is an independent judgment about the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty review. A counterparty review is a written analysis of a counterpartys business profile and financial strength resulting in an internal credit rating which represents the probability of default on financial obligations to the firm. The determination of internal credit ratings incorporates assumptions with respect to the counterpartys future business performance, the nature and outlook for the counterpartys industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel within Credit Risk Management, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. Our global credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economic groups). These systems also provide management with comprehensive information on our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. Risk Measures and Limits We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in an event of non payment by a counterparty. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, the primary measure is potential exposure, which is our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position. We also monitor credit risk in terms of current exposure, which is the amount presently owed to the firm after taking into account applicable netting and collateral. 98 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis We use credit limits at various levels (counterparty, economic group, industry, country) to control the size of our credit exposures. Limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties. Limits for industries and countries are based on the firms risk tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. Stress Tests/Scenario Analysis We use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements. Some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event (e.g., sovereign debt default). Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring. We run stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. Stress tests are regularly conducted jointly with the firms market and liquidity risk functions. Risk Mitigants To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and or to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified level. For loans and lending commitments, we typically employ a variety of potential risk mitigants, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction. Risk mitigants include: collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow the firm to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan. When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterpartys financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent company, we may obtain third party guarantees of the counterpartys obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements. Credit Exposures The firms credit exposures are described further below. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include both interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks. OTC Derivatives. Derivatives are reported on a net by counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Derivatives are accounted for at fair value net of cash collateral received or posted under credit support agreements. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, the firm includes a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 99 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis The tables below present the distribution of our exposure to OTC derivatives by tenor, based on expected duration for mortgage related credit derivatives and generally on remaining contractual maturity for other derivatives, both before and after the effect of collateral and netting agreements. Receivable and payable balances for the same counterparty across tenor categories are netted under enforceable netting agreements, and cash collateral received is netted under credit support agreements. Receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same tenor category are netted within such tenor category. The categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Lending Activities. We manage the firms traditional credit origination activities, including funded loans, lending commitments and the William Street credit extension program, using the credit risk process, measures and limits described above. Other lending positions, including secondary trading positions, are risk managed as a component of market risk. Other Credit Exposures. The firm is exposed to credit risk from its receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations are primarily comprised of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties are generally comprised of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short term nature of these receivables. Credit Exposures During the year ended December 2011, our credit exposures increased, reflecting growth in lending activity and OTC derivatives, and increased cash balances. While credit spreads widened during the year ended December 2011, the percentage of our credit exposure arising from non investment grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) was essentially unchanged from December 2010. Counterparty defaults and the associated credit losses have remained at low levels during the year ended December 2011 as compared with the same prior year period. The tables below present the firms credit exposures related to cash, OTC derivatives, and loans and lending commitments associated with traditional credit origination activities broken down by industry, region and internal credit rating.

Operational Risk Management Overview Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures. Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: clients, products and business practices; execution, delivery and process management; business disruption and system failures; employment practices and workplace safety; damage to physical assets; internal fraud; and external fraud. The firm maintains a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk Committee, along with the support of regional or entity specific working groups or committees, provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies and framework. Our Operational Risk Management department (Operational Risk Management) is a risk management function independent of our revenue producing units, reports to the firms chief risk officer, and is responsible for developing and implementing policies, methodologies and a formalized framework for operational risk management with the goal of minimizing our exposure to operational risk. Operational Risk Management Process Managing operational risk requires timely and accurate information as well as a strong control culture. We seek to manage our operational risk through: the training, supervision and development of our people; the active participation of senior management in identifying and mitigating key operational risks across the firm; independent control and support functions that monitor operational risk on a daily basis and have instituted extensive policies and procedures and implemented controls designed to prevent the occurrence of operational risk events; proactive communication between our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions; and a network of systems throughout the firm to facilitate the collection of data used to analyze and assess our operational risk exposure. We combine top down and bottom up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top down perspective, the firms senior management assesses firmwide and business level operational risk profiles. From a bottom up perspective, revenue producing units and independent control and support functions are responsible for risk management on a day to day basis, including identifying, mitigating, and escalating operational risks to senior management. Our operational risk framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under Basel 2 and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. Our framework includes the following practices: Risk identification and reporting; Risk measurement; and Risk monitoring. Internal Audit performs a review of our operational risk framework, including our key controls, processes and applications, on an annual basis to ensure the effectiveness of our framework. 104 Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Risk Identification and Reporting The core of our operational risk management framework is risk identification and reporting. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. We have established policies that require managers in our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions to escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in the firms systems and or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. In addition, our firmwide systems capture internal operational risk event data, key metrics such as transaction volumes, and statistical information such as performance trends. We use an internally developed operational risk management application to aggregate and organize this information. Managers from both revenue producing units and independent control and support functions analyze the information to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk. We also provide operational risk reports to senior management, risk committees and the Board periodically. Risk Measurement We measure the firms operational risk exposure over a twelve month time horizon using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative assessments of the potential frequency and extent of potential operational risk losses, for each of the firms businesses. Operational risk measurement incorporates qualitative and quantitative assessments of factors including: internal and external operational risk event data; assessments of the firms internal controls; evaluations of the complexity of the firms business activities; the degree of and potential for automation in the firms processes; new product information; the legal and regulatory environment; changes in the markets for the firms products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of the firms customers and counterparties; and the liquidity of the capital markets and the reliability of the infrastructure that supports the capital markets. The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses ultimately are used to determine the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. Risk Monitoring We evaluate changes in the operational risk profile of the firm and its businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which the firm operates, by monitoring these factors at a firmwide, entity and business level. The firm has both detective and preventive internal controls, which are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational risk losses and the probability of operational risk events. We monitor the results of assessments and independent internal audits of these internal controls. Recent Accounting Developments See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information about Recent Accounting Developments. Certain Risk Factors That May Affect Our Businesses We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. For a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks, see Overview and Structure of Risk Management. A summary of the more important factors that could affect our businesses follows. For a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by declining asset values. This is particularly true for those businesses in which we have net long positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral. Our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. Goldman Sachs 2011 Form 10 K 105 Table of Contents THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Managements Discussion and Analysis Our market making activities have been and may be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility. Our investment banking, client execution and investment management businesses have been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to general declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions. Our investment management business may be affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products. We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies. Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets or by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an increase in our credit spreads. Conflicts of interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately identify and address conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses. Group Inc. is a holding company and is dependent for liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to restrictions. Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets or whose securities or obligations we hold. Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making, underwriting, investing and lending activities. The financial services industry is highly competitive. We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and new markets. Derivative transactions and delayed settlements may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses. Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees. Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world. We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity. A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new trading technology may adversely affect our business and may increase competition. Our commodities activities, particularly our power generation interests and our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs. In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or natural disasters. Item 7A.
