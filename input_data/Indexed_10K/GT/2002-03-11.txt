ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (All per share amounts are diluted) CONSOLIDATED Net sales in 2001 were $14.15 billion, compared to $14.42 billion in 2000 and $13.36 billion in 1999. A net loss of $203.6 million, $1.27 per share, was recorded in 2001, compared to net income of $40.3 million, $.25 per share, in 2000 and $243.2 million, $1.53 per share, in 1999. Net Sales Worldwide tire unit sales in 2001 were 219.3 million units, a decrease of 4.0 million units or 1.8% compared to 2000. North American (U.S. and Canada) volume decreased 3.9 million units or 3.4% in 2001, while international unit sales decreased .1 million units or .1%. Worldwide replacement unit sales decreased 1.6% in 2001, primarily in Europe and Latin America. Original equipment unit sales were 2.2% lower in 2001, primarily in North America and Eastern Europe. Worldwide tire unit sales in 2000 were 223.3 million units, 11.4% higher than in 1999. The Dunlop businesses contributed 37.3 million units during 2000, compared to 14.4 million units in 1999. Total North American volume increased 6.3% from 1999 while international unit sales increased 17.5%. Worldwide original equipment unit sales rose 10.7% from 1999, with increases in all regions outside of North America. Replacement unit sales increased 11.7%, primarily in the European Union and North America. Revenues decreased 1.9% in 2001 primarily due to lower tire unit sales and the effect of currency translation on international results. Goodyear estimates that versus 2000, currency translation adversely affected revenues by approximately $395 million. Revenues increased 7.9% in 2000 due primarily to higher tire unit sales. The Dunlop businesses, acquired on September 1, 1999, contributed $2.26 billion to 2000 sales, compared to $873.4 million in 1999. Revenues in 2000 were adversely impacted by the effect of currency translation on international results, primarily in Europe, where the average value of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar dropped 13.0% from the 1999 average rate. Goodyear estimates that versus 1999, currency movements adversely affected revenues in 2000 by approximately $450 million. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was 82.1% of sales in 2001, compared to 80.7% in 2000 and 81.1% in 1999. CGS reflected higher conversion costs resulting from lower levels of plant utilization as Goodyear reduced finished goods inventory levels, as well as higher raw materials costs. Goodyear estimates that production cutbacks relative to 2000 levels resulted in approximately $320 million of underabsorbed costs due to less efficient absorption of fixed costs during 2001. 34 Table of Contents Costs were favorably impacted by the effects of the previous rationalization actions and ongoing cost containment measures. Goodyear expects that the cost of energy and raw materials will remain at 2001 levels or decrease slightly. In addition, in 2000 Goodyear negotiated a new labor agreement in the United States that is anticipated to continue to result in higher costs in future periods. These costs may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market. CGS in 2000 increased in dollars, but decreased as a percent to sales compared to 1999 due primarily to the effects of rationalization actions, ongoing cost containment measures and synergies realized in part from the strategic alliance with Sumitomo. Margins were adversely affected by the worldwide competitive pricing environment and a change in product and market mix to lower margin tires. Research and development expenses are included in CGS and were $375.5 million in 2001, compared to $423.1 million in 2000 and $438.0 million in 1999. Research and development expenditures in 2002 are expected to be approximately $375 million. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) in 2001 was 15.9% of sales, compared to 15.5% in 2000 and 15.1% in 1999. SAG increased in dollars and as a percent to sales in 2001 primarily due to increased warehousing and distribution costs in North America. SAG decreased in all international SBUs due to cost containment initiatives and the favorable effect on SAG of foreign currency exchange rates. SAG increased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to the acquisition of, and higher SAG levels at, the Dunlop businesses. SAG benefited in 2000 from the favorable impact of ongoing worldwide cost containment measures. EBIT Consolidated EBIT is computed as follows: net sales less CGS and SAG. Consolidated EBIT was $278.9 million in 2001, $542.5 million in 2000 and $506.4 million in 1999. Consolidated margin (consolidated EBIT divided by consolidated sales) was 2.0% in 2001, 3.8% in 2000 and 3.8% in 1999. Interest Expense Interest expense in 2001 was $292.4 million, compared to $282.6 million in 2000 and $179.4 million in 1999. Interest expense increased due to higher average debt levels. Other (Income) and Expense Other (income) and expense was $11.8 million in 2001, compared to $27.8 million in 2000 and $(147.1) million in 1999. Other (income) expense in 2001 included gains of $17.0 million ($13.9 million after tax or $.09 per share) resulting from the sale of land and buildings in the United Kingdom and $27.4 million ($16.9 million after tax or $.10 per share) resulting from the sale of Goodyears specialty chemical business. Other (income) and expense in 2000 included a gain of $5.0 million ($3.2 million after tax or $.02 per share) on the sale of land at a manufacturing facility in Mexico. During 1999, other (income) and expense included a gain totaling $149.7 million ($143.7 million after tax or $.90 per share) on the change in control of 25% of the European businesses contributed to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. by the Company. In addition, proceeds of $17.0 million ($11.1 million after tax or $.07 per share) were realized in 1999 from Goodyears sale of customer lists and formulations in connection with its exit from the production of certain rubber chemicals. 35 Table of Contents Other (income) and expense included accounts receivable sales fees and commitment fees totaling $53.3 million, $43.9 million and $34.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 4, Other (Income) and Expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Foreign currency exchange expense was $.1 million in 2001, while income was recorded totaling $6.7 million in 2000 and $27.6 million in 1999. Foreign currency exchange in 1999 benefited from the impact of currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items, primarily in Brazil. Equity in Earnings of Affiliates Equity in earnings of affiliates was a loss of $40.6 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $22.4 million in 2000 and income of $10.3 million in 1999. The losses in 2001 and 2000 were due primarily to operating losses and rationalization charges incurred by South Pacific Tyres, Ltd. (SPT), an Australian tire manufacturer in which Goodyear owns a 50% equity interest. Goodyears share of rationalization charges recorded by SPT in 2001 and 2000 totaled approximately $24.0 million ($24.0 million after tax or $.15 per share) and $16.1 million ($10.5 million after tax or $.07 per share), respectively. Income Taxes Goodyear had a tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 25.4% for 2001. Goodyears effective tax rate was 20.0% and 16.7% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The effective rate in 2000 increased from 1999 due to the nontaxable character of the $149.7 million gain in 1999 resulting from the change in control of 25% of Goodyears businesses contributed to the European joint venture with Sumitomo. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 16, Income Taxes. Rationalization Activity To maintain global competitiveness, Goodyear has implemented rationalization actions over the past several years for the purpose of reducing over capacity, eliminating redundancies and reducing costs. Goodyear recorded net rationalization costs of $206.8 million in 2001, $124.1 million in 2000 and $171.6 million in 1999. Goodyear has reduced employment levels by approximately 9,900 from December 31, 2000 and almost 19,000 since 1998, primarily as a result of rationalization activities. Fourth Quarter 2001 Program Goodyear recorded a net rationalization charge on the Consolidated Statement of Income totaling $127.8 million ($101.2 million after tax or $.62 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2001, which included a $4.1 million reversal of reserves no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. These actions were in response to continued competitive conditions in the markets served by Goodyear and worldwide economic uncertainty. Under these actions, Goodyear has provided for worldwide associate reductions through retail and administrative consolidation and manufacturing plant downsizing and consolidation. Goodyear anticipates that, upon completion of these actions, it will further reduce annual operating costs by approximately $85 million. The 2001 fourth quarter actions included associate related costs of $58.8 million for the release of approximately 2,200 associates around the world, primarily production and administrative associates in Europe. During 2001, approximately 300 associates were released under this program at a cost of $1.6 million, however, a significant amount of the payments related to these 36 Table of Contents associates will be incurred during 2002. Rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaled $73.1 million and were primarily for the writeoff of equipment taken out of service and noncancellable lease contracts. During 2001, Goodyear incurred $42.5 million of these costs for the writeoff of equipment taken out of service. The remaining reserve for costs related to the completion of these actions was $87.8 million at December 31, 2001. First Quarter 2001/Fourth Quarter 2000 Program Goodyear recorded a rationalization charge totaling $79.0 million ($57.1 million after tax or $.36 per share) in the 2001 first quarter. Of the $79.0 million charge, $12.5 million related to the closure of Goodyears manufacturing facility in Italy announced in 1999 and $66.5 million continued the rationalization program announced in the fourth quarter of 2000. Goodyear recorded a rationalization charge totaling $124.1 million ($100.1 million after tax or $.63 per share) during 2000, of which $4.7 million related to the 1999 program, primarily the closure of Goodyears manufacturing facility in Italy, and $119.4 million related to rationalization actions announced during 2000. These 2000 actions were for global workforce reductions and manufacturing facility consolidations including the closure of a tire plant in Latin America. Pursuant to the program recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001, Goodyear has released approximately 6,800 associates to date, for which costs totaling $122.8 million were incurred during 2001. The balance of the provision for associate related costs totaled $5.9 million and $73.2 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaling $12.3 million were incurred during 2001. These costs were primarily for ongoing lease obligations. The balance of the provision for rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaled $3.4 million and $8.8 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Goodyear will complete these rationalization actions during the first quarter of 2002. Annual pretax savings of approximately $260 million were expected when the first quarter 2001/fourth quarter 2000 program was approved. Goodyear estimates that operating costs were reduced by approximately $155 million in 2001 as a result of these actions. 1999 Program During 1999, Goodyear committed to a number of rationalization actions to reduce costs and increase productivity and efficiency. The actions consisted of worldwide associate reductions, exit from the CART/IRL racing series, termination of tire production at the Gadsden, Alabama, facility and manufacturing facilities in Latin America and Italy, and downsizing and consolidation of tire manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Latin America. A charge of $240.1 million ($177.7 million after tax or $1.13 per share) was recorded, of which $47.6 million related to non cash writeoffs and $192.5 million related to future cash outflows, primarily for associate severance costs. The associate related charges of $171.6 million provided for the release of approximately 5,000 associates worldwide. Non associate related costs of $68.5 million were primarily for the writeoff of equipment taken out of service and noncancellable contracts at the closed manufacturing facilities. Goodyear recorded reversals of, and adjustments to, rationalization plans of $68.5 million ($45.2 million after tax or $.29 per share) during 1999, including $51.5 million related to charges which were originally recorded during 1999, primarily related to the decision to resume production of certain passenger tire lines in a portion of the Gadsden facility. The remaining $17.0 million related to reserves from prior year plans which were no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. The net charge to the Consolidated Statement of Income totaled $171.6 million ($132.5 million after tax or $.84 per share) during 1999. Related to the 1999 actions, Goodyear incurred costs of $16.0 million during 2001, primarily for the release of 350 associates and final plant closing costs for the closed manufacturing 37 Table of Contents facility in Italy. The remaining reserve for the 1999 programs was $.8 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Goodyear has completed these actions with the exception of ongoing severance payments. Dunlop Integration Program The following rationalization actions have been recorded as adjustments to the purchase price allocation in respect of the acquired Dunlop businesses, and did not affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. Goodyear committed to certain rationalization actions related to the Dunlop businesses for the purpose of optimizing market growth opportunities and maximizing cost efficiencies. Goodyear recorded costs in 1999, 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 totaling $72.8 million, substantially all of which was for future cash outflows. Under these rationalization programs, associate related costs for the release or relocation of approximately 2,000 production, support, technical, retail and administrative associates totaling $58.5 million were recorded, and rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaling $14.3 million were recorded primarily for lease cancellations and future rental payments under noncancellable leases. Through December 31, 2001, costs totaling $61.0 million had been incurred and reversals of $5.0 million had been recorded for reserves no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. Goodyear has completed the Dunlop integration program except for ongoing associate severance payments and future rental payments under noncancellable leases. A balance of $6.8 million remains at December 31, 2001, for these purposes. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 3, Rationalizations. Strategic Alliance On September 1, 1999, Goodyear commenced operations under a global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. (Sumitomo). Under the global alliance agreements, Goodyear acquired 75%, and Sumitomo owned 25%, of Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V., a Netherlands holding company. Concurrently, the holding company acquired substantially all of Sumitomos tire businesses in Europe, including eight tire manufacturing plants located in England, France and Germany and sales and distribution operations in 18 European countries, and most of Goodyears tire businesses in Europe. Excluded from the European joint venture are Goodyears tire businesses in Poland (other than a sales company), Slovenia and Turkey (as well as Morocco and South Africa), Goodyears aircraft tire businesses, and Goodyears textile, steel tire cord and tire mold manufacturing plants, a technical center and related facilities located in Luxembourg. Goodyear also acquired 75%, and Sumitomo acquired 25%, of Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America Ltd., a holding company that purchased Sumitomos tire manufacturing operations in North America and certain of its related tire sales and distribution operations. In addition, Goodyear acquired 100% of the balance of Sumitomos Dunlop Tire distribution and sales operations in the United States and Canada. Goodyear also acquired a 25% (and Sumitomo acquired a 75%) equity interest in each of two tire companies in Japan, one for the distribution and sale of Goodyear brand passenger and truck tires in the replacement market in Japan and the other for the distribution and sale of Goodyear brand and Dunlop brand tires to original equipment manufacturers in Japan. Goodyear transferred certain assets of its subsidiary located in Japan in exchange for such equity interests and approximately $27 million in cash. Goodyear also acquired a 51% (and Sumitomo acquired a 49%) equity interest in a company that coordinates and disseminates commercialized tire technology among Goodyear, Sumitomo, the joint ventures and their respective affiliates, and an 80% (and Sumitomo acquired a 20%) equity interest in a global purchasing company. The global alliance Agreements also provided for the investment by Goodyear and Sumitomo in the common stock of the other. 38 Table of Contents Goodyear accounted for the strategic alliance using the purchase method. The cost of the acquired businesses totaled approximately $1.24 billion, including the cash payment of $931.6 million and the fair value of 25% of the Goodyear businesses contributed to the European joint venture, or $307 million. In addition, the Dunlop businesses contributed to the joint venture companies by Sumitomo included $130 million of debt. Approximately $367 million of goodwill was recorded on the transaction which was being amortized on a straight line basis over 40 years. Amortization was discontinued on January 1, 2002, as a result of Goodyears adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodyear recognized a gain of $149.7 million ($143.7 million after tax or $.90 per share) on the change of control of 25% of the businesses it contributed to the European joint venture. For further information, refer to the notes to the financial statements No. 3, Rationalizations and No. 8, Investments. The Euro On January 1, 2002, the Euro became the lawful currency of each member state of the European Monetary Union. Goodyear actively prepared for the conversion of all information systems software to the Euro, which became the functional currency of most of its European businesses. This conversion did not have a material impact on results of operations, financial position or liquidity of Goodyears operations. UNCERTAINTIES, ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND OTHER MATTERS If reduced levels of original equipment demand continue as anticipated, resulting lower levels of plant utilization would increase unit costs, which costs may not be recovered in the market. Increased labor costs are anticipated and Goodyear could experience unexpected higher raw material and energy prices. These costs, if incurred, may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market. Goodyear is unable to predict future currency fluctuations. Sales and earnings in future periods are likely to be unfavorably impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies. A continuation of the current economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe is likely to unfavorably impact Goodyears sales and earnings in future periods. Similarly, continued volatile economic conditions in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods. The ultimate liability of Goodyear in respect of the various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings to which it is a party cannot be estimated with certainty. Goodyears accounting policy is to determine whether a liability should be recorded and to estimate the amount of such liability, based on the information available and using assumptions and methods it has concluded are appropriate. As additional information becomes available, Goodyear will reassess its evaluation of the pending claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. Goodyear has established a liability in respect of the approximately 63,000 asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2001, and an asset for expected recoveries under insurance policies and coverage in place agreements with certain primary insurance carriers. The claims relate to exposure to asbestos in certain rubber coated products manufactured by Goodyear in the past or in certain Goodyear facilities. During 2001, Goodyear received approximately 18,000 new claims and resolved approximately 9,500 asbestos claims. The amount spent on asbestos litigation defense and claim resolution during 2001 was approximately $15.5 million (before recovery of insurance proceeds). Goodyear believes it will recover a substantial portion of its liability from the proceeds of existing insurance policies. Goodyear cannot predict the number of future claims, the cost of disposing of existing and future claims, or the future ability to recover from insurance carriers. Goodyear also has claims asserted in other legal proceedings to which it is currently a party. These proceedings include, among other things, several class actions relating to alleged breaches 39 Table of Contents of warranty or product defects relating to Goodyear Entran II hose used in certain home heating systems and certain of Goodyears Load Range D and E light truck tires. A jury in a civil action between the Company and Heatway in Federal District Court in Cleveland, Ohio, found that the Company did not breach the implied warranty of merchantability in respect of Entran II hose sold to Heatway for installation in radiant heating systems and that the hose was fit for use in the systems and the court, on February 4, 2000, dismissed all claims of Heatway regarding the Entran II hose. On February 25, 2002, a jury in a civil action in a Colorado State Court awarded the plaintiffs damages for alleged defects in Goodyear Entran II hose installed as part of Heatway radiant heating systems at five homesites in the amount of $5.9 million, which is trebled under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, plus interest, attorneys fees and costs, for a total award of approximately $20 million. The Company believes the verdict was based on material errors of fact and law and will appeal. Litigation is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Due to these inherent uncertainties, it is possible that the actual liability, if any, will differ from estimates. Based on its understanding and evaluation of these claims, as well as existing environmental claims, Goodyear believes these matters are not likely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position in future periods, although unanticipated adverse results in these proceedings could have a material impact on earnings and cash flow in any quarter or for any year. The terms and conditions of Goodyears global alliance with Sumitomo as set forth in the Umbrella Agreement between Goodyear and Sumitomo provide for certain minority exit rights available to Sumitomo commencing in September 2004. Sumitomos exit rights, in the unlikely event of exercise, could require Goodyear to make a substantial payment to acquire Sumitomos interest in the alliance. Goodyear entered into an agreement with Pacific Dunlop Ltd. (PDL) during 2001 relating to SPT. Under the agreement, PDL has the right, during the period beginning August of 2005 and ending one year later, to require Goodyear to purchase PDLs 50% interest in SPT at a formula price based on the earnings of SPT. If PDL does not exercise its right, Goodyear may require PDL to sell its interest to Goodyear during the 180 days following the expiration of PDLs right at a price established using the same formula. In view of current conditions in the financial markets, which are subject to change, and based on current estimates, it is possible that, beginning in 2003, Goodyear may be required to make substantial contributions to its domestic pension plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements in future periods. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS On January 1, 2001, Goodyear adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended and interpreted. SFAS 133 requires all derivatives to be recognized as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Changes in such fair value will impact earnings to the extent of any ineffectiveness in hedging relationships. The transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of SFAS 133 increased Shareholders Equity by $5.4 million. On January 1, 2001, Goodyear adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (SFAS 140), Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS 140 requires that after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognize the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognize financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognize liabilities when extinguished. A transfer of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those assets is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange. The adoption of SFAS 140 did not have a material impact on Goodyears results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 40 Table of Contents On January 1, 2002, Goodyear adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and specifies that, among other things, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill will no longer be amortized. The standard requires goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life to be annually tested for impairment and written down to fair value if considered impaired. Goodyear estimates that amortization expense in 2002 will be reduced by approximately $25 million to $30 million after tax ($.15 per share to $.17 per share) compared to 2001, and does not anticipate any impairment write down as a result of the implementation of SFAS 142. SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects the strategic business units of Goodyear, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. The tire business is managed on a regional basis. Engineered Products and Chemical Products are managed on a global basis. Results of operations in the tire and engineered products business segments were measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and EBIT. Results of operations of the chemical business included transfers to other segments. Segment EBIT is computed as follows: net sales less cost of goods sold, less selling, administrative and general expense (excluding corporate administrative expenses). Segment EBIT was $366.7 million in 2001, $599.0 million in 2000 and $544.6 million in 1999. Segment operating margin (segment EBIT divided by segment sales) in 2001 was 2.5%, compared to 4.0% in 2000 and 3.9% in 1999. Segment EBIT does not include the previously discussed rationalization charges and gains on asset sales. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 20, Business Segments. North American Tire North American Tire segment sales in 2001 were $7.15 billion, increasing .6% from $7.11 billion in 2000 and 7.6% from $6.65 billion in 1999. Unit sales in 2001 were 112.0 million, decreasing 3.4% from 2000 and increasing 2.7% from 1999. Replacement unit sales in 2001 increased .2% from 2000 and 10.9% from 1999. Original equipment volume in 2001 decreased 11.3% from 2000 and 13.2% from 1999. Sales in 2001 increased compared to 2000 due to the favorable impact of a change in product mix to higher priced tires, price increases in the replacement market and units delivered in connection with the Ford Motor Company (Ford) replacement program for certain light truck tires of a competitor. Sales were adversely affected in 2001 by lower original equipment volume resulting from production cutbacks by the manufacturers of automobiles and commercial trucks which Goodyear supplies, and lower volume in the replacement market during the fourth quarter, as economic conditions deteriorated. During 2001, Goodyear supplied approximately 5 million tire units with an EBIT impact of approximately $95 million in connection with the Ford replacement program. Sales in 2000 increased from 1999 due to the acquisition of the Dunlop businesses in the United States and Canada. The Dunlop businesses contributed $755.0 million to sales in 2000, compared to $252.3 million in 1999. Sales in the last four months of 2000 benefited from the sale of approximately 3.0 million tires related to a replacement program involving approximately 6.5 million of a competitors tires. Sales reflected improved customer fill rates from 1999, but revenues were adversely impacted by reduced tire shipments resulting from production cutbacks by original equipment customers in the auto and commercial truck industries. In addition, price 41 Table of Contents increases implemented earlier in 2000 met with resistance in the marketplace and as a result negatively impacted sales of commercial tires in North America. North American Tire segment EBIT was $107.8 million in 2001, compared to $260.7 million in 2000 and $26.3 million in 1999. Operating margin in 2001 was 1.5%, compared to 3.7% in 2000 and .4% in 1999. During the fourth quarter of 2001, North American Tire recorded a charge of $30 million for a voluntary tire replacement program covering certain tires in service on 15 passenger vans and ambulances. These tires will be replaced with tires of the latest design. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 of these tires are in service and will be replaced. EBIT in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to higher conversion costs resulting from lower levels of plant utilization, higher raw material costs, higher SAG costs, lower sales volume and the charge for Goodyears tire replacement program. EBIT was favorably impacted by price increases in the replacement market, a shift in mix to higher margin tires, the Ford replacement program and lower research and development costs. EBIT in 2000 increased from 1999 due to the acquisition of the Dunlop businesses, lower SAG resulting from cost reduction programs and the inclusion of nonrecurring costs in EBIT in 1999. EBIT in 2000 also benefited from increased consumer replacement shipments due to a competitors tire recall program. EBIT was adversely affected in 2000 by significantly higher energy costs, increased raw material and labor costs and production cutbacks to better align inventory with original equipment demand. EBIT did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $31.6 million in 2001, $(.7) million in 2000 and $71.5 million in 1999. Revenues and EBIT in the North American Tire segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, reduced demand by original equipment customers, changes in product mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, anticipated higher wage and benefit costs and general economic conditions. European Union Tire European Union Tire segment sales in 2001 were $3.13 billion, decreasing 2.2% from $3.20 billion in 2000 and increasing 18.4% from $2.64 billion in 1999. Unit sales in 2001 were 61.1 million, increasing 1.4% from 2000 and 33.6% from 1999. Replacement unit sales in 2001 decreased 2.0% from 2000 and increased 26.1% from 1999. Original equipment volume in 2001 increased 9.5% from 2000 and 53.1% from 1999. Revenues decreased in 2001 from 2000 due primarily to currency translation. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation adversely affected European Union Tire segment sales by approximately $85 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues also decreased in 2001 due to a shift in mix toward lower priced original equipment tires and competitive pricing pressures, particularly in the first half of 2001. Revenues were favorably impacted by higher volume. Sales in 2000 increased from 1999 due to the acquisition of the Dunlop businesses. The Dunlop businesses contributed $1.50 billion to sales in 2000, compared to $621.1 million in 1999. Revenues were adversely impacted by the decrease in the value of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, competitive pricing, especially in England and Germany, lower volume in some market segments and a change in mix to lower priced tires. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation adversely affected European Union Tire segment sales by approximately $300 million in 2000 compared to 1999. 42 Table of Contents European Union Tire segment EBIT was $57.2 million in 2001, decreasing 35.5% from $88.7 million in 2000 and 69.6% from $188.0 million in 1999. Segment operating margin in 2001 was 1.8%, compared to 2.8% in 2000 and 7.1% in 1999. EBIT decreased in 2001 from 2000 due to higher raw material costs, a change in mix to lower margin original equipment tires and currency translation. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation reduced operating income by approximately $5 million in 2001 compared to 2000. EBIT was favorably impacted by higher sales volume and lower SAG costs resulting from cost containment and rationalization programs. EBIT in 2000 decreased from 1999 due to competitive market conditions, manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from the relocation of tire production from England to the European continent and the closure of a tire plant in Italy, and higher raw material and energy prices. In addition, Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation reduced operating income by approximately $20 million in 2000 compared to 1999. EBIT was favorably affected in 2000 by higher tire unit sales resulting from the acquisition of the Dunlop businesses. EBIT did not include net rationalization charges totaling $81.5 million and gains on asset sales of $17.0 million in 2001, net rationalization charges totaling $23.3 million in 2000 and net rationalization charges totaling $2.8 million in 1999. A gain totaling $149.7 million resulting from the change in control of 25% of Goodyears businesses contributed to the European joint venture was also not included in 1999 EBIT. Revenues and EBIT in the European Union Tire segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of currency translation if the U.S. dollar strengthens against European currencies. Sales and EBIT in future periods may be negatively impacted by continued competitive pricing conditions, changes in mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices and the general economic slowdown in the region. Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire (Eastern Europe Tire) segment sales in 2001 were $703.1 million, decreasing 11.3% from $793.0 million in 2000 and 13.5% from $812.9 million in 1999. Unit sales in 2001 were 14.0 million, decreasing 10.1% from 2000 and 11.5% from 1999. Replacement unit sales in 2001 decreased 8.1% from 2000 and 11.5% from 1999. Original equipment volume in 2001 decreased 17.2% from 2000 and 11.1% from 1999. Revenues in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to currency devaluations in Turkey and South Africa and lower volume in both the original equipment and replacement markets. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation adversely affected Eastern Europe Tire segment sales by approximately $120 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues in 2000 decreased from 1999 due to a downturn in the replacement market and the effects of currency translation, but benefited from generally improved pricing in the region and a general improvement in the economic conditions in Eastern Europe and South Africa. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation adversely affected Eastern Europe Tire segment sales by approximately $75 million in 2000 compared to 1999. Eastern Europe Tire EBIT was $20.2 million in 2001, decreasing 63.0% from $54.6 million in 2000 and 59.4% from $49.8 million in 1999. Operating margin in 2001 was 2.9%, compared to 6.9% in 2000 and 6.1% in 1999. EBIT in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to the economic crisis in Turkey, the effects of currency translation, lower sales volume and the effect of production cutbacks to align inventory levels with demand. EBIT was favorably impacted by reduced SAG resulting from cost containment 43 Table of Contents and rationalization programs. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation reduced operating income by approximately $25 million in 2001 compared to 2000. EBIT in 2000 increased from 1999 due primarily to increased factory utilization levels and improved market conditions. EBIT in 2000 was adversely impacted by an industry wide strike in Turkey. EBIT did not include net rationalization charges totaling $11.2 million in 2001, $9.6 million in 2000 and $.3 million in 1999. Revenues and EBIT in the Eastern Europe Tire segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, changes in mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, continued volatile economic conditions and currency translation. Latin American Tire Latin American Tire segment sales in 2001 were $1.01 billion, decreasing 3.4% from $1.05 billion in 2000, but increasing 6.8% from $948.1 million in 1999. Unit sales in 2001 were 20.0 million, increasing 1.3% from 2000 and 12.4% from 1999. Replacement unit sales in 2001 decreased 6.3% from 2000 and 1.4% from 1999. Original equipment volume in 2001 increased 24.9% from 2000 and 67.6% from 1999. Revenues in 2001 decreased compared to 2000 due to currency translation, particularly in Brazil, a shift in mix toward lower priced original equipment tires, lower volume in the replacement market due to an economic slowdown and weak economic conditions in the region. Revenues benefited from price adjustments partially offsetting currency movements and higher volume. Goodyear estimates that currency translation reduced sales by approximately $85 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues in 2000 increased from 1999 due primarily to higher tire unit sales, but were adversely affected by competitive pricing pressures. Latin American Tire segment EBIT was $89.8 million in 2001, increasing 28.7% from $69.8 million in 2000 and 32.6% from $67.7 million in 1999. Operating margin in 2001 was 8.9%, compared to 6.7% in 2000 and 7.1% in 1999. EBIT in 2001 reflected price adjustments partially offsetting currency movements, the benefits of cost reduction programs, rationalizations, lower raw material costs and higher volume. EBIT was adversely affected by currency translation and a change in mix to lower margin original equipment tires. Goodyear estimates that the effects of currency translation reduced operating income by approximately $35 million in 2001 compared to 2000. EBIT in 2000 increased from 1999 due to higher tire unit sales, but was adversely affected by continued pricing pressures and higher raw material and labor costs. EBIT did not include rationalization charges totaling $.2 million in 2001, rationalization charges totaling $65.7 million and a $5.0 million gain on the sale of land at a manufacturing facility in Mexico in 2000 and rationalization charges totaling $77.3 million in 1999. Revenues and EBIT in future periods may be adversely affected by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, changes in mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, continued volatile economic conditions, future adverse economic conditions in Mexico, Central America and South America and currency translation. 44 Table of Contents Asia Tire Asia Tire segment sales in 2001 were $493.9 million, decreasing 5.9% from $524.6 million in 2000 and 16.7% from $593.2 million in 1999. Unit sales in 2001 were 12.2 million, increasing 3.1% from 2000 and .9% from 1999. Replacement unit sales in 2001 were flat from 2000 and decreased 8.7% from 1999. Original equipment volume in 2001 increased 12.3% from 2000 and 39.8% from 1999. Revenues in 2001 decreased from 2000, reflecting the adverse impacts of currency translation, softening demand in some markets and competitive pricing pressures. Goodyear estimates that currency translation reduced sales by approximately $35 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues in 2000 decreased from 1999 due primarily to the absence of the replacement tire business transferred to Goodyears non consolidated joint venture with Sumitomo in Japan, which contributed revenues of approximately $49.7 million in 1999. In addition, revenues were adversely affected by competitive pricing, a less favorable product mix and currency translation. Asia Tire segment EBIT was $19.9 million in 2001, increasing 11.2% from $17.9 million in 2000 but decreasing 23.5% from $26.0 million in 1999. Operating margin in 2001 was 4.0%, compared to 3.4% in 2000 and 4.4% in 1999. EBIT in 2001 increased from 2000 as the adverse effects of currency translation and price competition were offset by lower conversion costs as a result of cost containment programs, higher volume and lower raw material costs. EBIT in 2000 decreased from 1999 due primarily to lower tire unit sales, competitive pricing conditions driven in part by increased low cost imports into the region and a shift in mix to lower margin tires, higher raw material and energy costs and price competition. EBIT did not include rationalization charges totaling $45.4 million in 2001, $3.3 million in 2000 and $1.5 million in 1999. Revenues and EBIT in future periods may be adversely impacted by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, changes in mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy costs and currency translation. Sales and EBIT of the Asia Tire segment do not include South Pacific Tyres Ltd. (SPT), a tire manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, which is 50% owned by Goodyear. Results of operations of SPT are not reported in segment results and are reflected in Goodyears Consolidated Statement of Income using the equity method. The following table presents the sales and operating income of the Companys Asia Tire segment together with 100% of the sales and EBIT of SPT: (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Net Sales: Asia Tire Segment $ 493.9 $ 524.6 $ 593.2 SPT 481.3 563.6 674.5 $ 975.2 $ 1,088.2 $ 1,267.7 EBIT: Asia Tire Segment $ 19.9 $ 17.9 $ 26.0 SPT (25.4 ) (11.1 ) 31.2 $ (5.5 ) $ 6.8 $ 57.2 SPT sales in 2001 were $481.3 million, decreasing 14.6% from $563.6 million in 2000 and 28.6% from $674.5 million in 1999. Revenues in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to currency trans 45 Table of Contents lation and competitive low cost imports aided by continued import tariff reductions in Australia. Revenues in 2000 decreased from 1999 due to competitive pressures from low cost imported tires and effects of currency translation. SPT EBIT was a loss of $25.4 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $11.1 million in 2000 and income of $31.2 million in 1999. EBIT in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to excess production capacity and the weakened Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. EBIT in 2000 decreased from 1999 due to production inefficiencies and higher raw material costs. SPT EBIT did not include rationalization charges of approximately $48.0 million in 2001 and $32.2 million in 2000. SPT debt totaled $67.4 million and $158.1 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Engineered Products Engineered Products segment sales in 2001 were $1.12 billion, decreasing 4.4% from $1.17 billion in 2000 and 9.1% from $1.23 billion in 1999. Revenues in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to unit sales decreases resulting from lower product demand from the automotive and transportation industries. Revenues were favorably impacted by increases in the conveyor belt and replacement products markets. Revenues in 2000 decreased from 1999 due primarily to Goodyears exit from the interior trim business in 1999, which contributed revenues of approximately $71.0 million in that year. In addition, revenues were adversely affected by reduced demand for conveyor belting for the mining and agriculture industries and reduced demand for hose and power transmission products in the North American replacement market. Engineered Products segment EBIT in 2001 was $11.6 million, decreasing 73.1% from $43.1 million in 2000 and 83.5% from $70.4 million in 1999. Operating margin in 2001 was 1.0%, compared to 3.7% in 2000 and 5.7% in 1999. EBIT in 2001 decreased from 2000 due primarily to lower revenues, increased SAG costs and increased costs associated with reduced capacity utilization resulting from reduced demand from the automotive industry. EBIT was favorably impacted by lower research and development and raw material costs. EBIT in 2000 decreased from 1999 due primarily to reduced demand, reduced capacity utilization, higher raw material costs and competitive pricing. EBIT did not include net rationalization charges of $1.5 million in 2001, $3.8 million in 2000 and $8.8 million in 1999. Revenues and EBIT in the Engineered Products segment may be adversely affected in future periods by lower original equipment demand, competitive pricing pressures, expected continuing unfavorable economic conditions in certain markets, adverse economic conditions globally in the mining, construction and agriculture industries, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, anticipated higher wage and benefit costs and currency translation. Chemical Products Chemical Products segment sales in 2001 were $1.04 billion, decreasing 8.2% from $1.13 billion in 2000 but increasing 9.2% from $949.8 million in 1999. Approximately 50% of Chemical Products sales are to Goodyears other segments. 46 Table of Contents Revenues in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to lower volume resulting from the slowdown in the tire industry. Revenues in 2000 increased from 1999 due primarily to price increases and higher sales volume. Chemical Products segment EBIT in 2001 was $60.2 million, decreasing 6.2% from $64.2 million in 2000 and 48.3% from $116.4 million in 1999. Operating margin in 2001 was 5.8%, compared to 5.7% in 2000 and 12.3% in 1999. EBIT in 2001 decreased from 2000 primarily due to lower volume as a result of decreased demand from tire manufacturers (including Goodyear) and higher energy costs. EBIT benefited from lower raw material and fixed costs. EBIT in 2000 decreased from 1999 due primarily to increased raw material and energy prices and the inability to recover cost increases due to the competitive pricing environment. EBIT did not include gains on asset sales of $27.4 million in 2001 and $17.0 million in 1999. EBIT did not include rationalization charges of $2.5 million in 1999. Goodyear sold its specialty chemical business in France and certain specialty chemical U.S. assets in the fourth quarter of 2001. The specialty chemical business generated sales of approximately $130 million in 2001. Revenues and EBIT in the Chemical Products segment may be adversely affected in future periods by competitive pricing pressures, lower aggregate demand levels for its products and unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.27 billion during 2001, as reported on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Working capital requirements decreased during the period as Goodyear implemented inventory reduction programs, reduced levels of gross receivables and increased its sales of trade accounts receivable. During the second quarter of 2001, Goodyear terminated its $550 million domestic accounts receivable continuous sale program and entered into a new program. The new program involves the continuous sale of substantially all of Goodyears domestic trade accounts receivable to Wingfoot A/R LLC, a wholly owned limited liability subsidiary company that is a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The results of operations and financial position of Wingfoot A/R LLC are not included in the consolidated financial statements of Goodyear as provided by SFAS 140. Wingfoot A/R LLC purchases Goodyears receivables with (a) the cash proceeds of borrowings from a group of five bank affiliated issuers of commercial paper, which borrowings are secured by the trade accounts receivable purchased from Goodyear ($580.0 million at December 31, 2001), (b) the cash proceeds of the Companys $98.2 million equity investment in Wingfoot A/R LLC and (c) a subordinated note payable to the Company in the amount of $385.2 million at December 31, 2001, which is equal to the total amount of trade receivables purchased by Wingfoot A/R LLC minus the sum of the equity of the Wingfoot A/R LLC and the cash proceeds from the sale of the notes issued by Wingfoot A/R LLC to the five lenders, and minus a discount. Goodyear retained responsibility for servicing the receivables. As the receivables are collected, the cash proceeds are used to purchase additional receivables. Goodyear pays fees under the program based on certain variable market interest rates and other agreed amounts. These fees are reported as Other (Income) and Expense. Wingfoot A/R LLC may borrow up to $825 million from the bank affiliated note purchasers. The amount that may be borrowed from time to time by Wingfoot A/R LLC depends on, among other things, the total uncollected balance of receivables owned by it. The borrowings are available to Wingfoot A/R LLC until February 2003, unless extended by the lenders for additional one year periods. 47 Table of Contents Various international subsidiaries of Goodyear have also established accounts receivable continuous sales programs whereunder these subsidiaries may receive proceeds from the sale of certain of their receivables to affiliates of certain banks. These subsidiaries retained servicing responsibilities. At December 31, 2001, the value in U.S. dollars of which these international subsidiaries may borrow is approximately $150 million. In addition, various other international subsidiaries of Goodyear sold certain of their trade receivables during 2001 and 2000. At December 31, 2001, the net proceeds for all sales of receivables by Goodyear were $851.8 million. Net cash inflows of $249.1 million were received in 2001 from transfers of accounts receivable under these and other programs. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 5, Accounts and Notes Receivable. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $447.4 million during 2001. Capital expenditures in 2001 were $435.4 million, of which $197.6 million was used on projects to increase capacity and improve productivity and $237.8 million was used for tire molds and various other projects. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $500 million in 2002.

Investing activities in 2001 included the sale of land and buildings in the United Kingdom and Goodyears specialty chemical business. Investing activities in 2000 included the sale of leasehold interests in, and the sale and leaseback of, various distribution facilities in the United States. Goodyear also acquired a majority ownership interest in a retreading production and distribution operation in the United States. Investing activities in 1999 included a cash payment of $931.6 million for the acquisition of majority interests in the Dunlop Tire businesses in Europe and North America. The asset acquisition amount of $892.0 million reflected on Goodyears Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is net of cash received. Other investing activities in 1999 included the net proceeds of $27 million from the sale of assets to the Japanese joint ventures formed under the strategic alliance, which are 25% owned by Goodyear, and the $17 million of proceeds from the sale of customer lists and formulations in connection with Goodyears exit from the production of certain rubber chemicals. At December 31, 2001, Goodyear had binding commitments for investments in land, buildings and equipment of $121.5 million and off balance sheet financial guarantees written and other commitments totaling $151.4 million. For further information on investing activities, refer to the notes to the financial statements No. 2, Strategic Alliance and No. 8, Investments. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $103.0 million during 2001. (In millions) 2001 2000 1999 Consolidated Debt $ 3,568.3 $ 3,585.8 $ 3,424.5 Debt to Debt and Equity 55.5% 50.6% 47.4% 48 Table of Contents Consolidated Debt as stated above at December 31, 2000 and 1999 does not include the 1.2% Convertible Notes issued to Sumitomo ($56.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2000 and $127.8 million outstanding at December 31, 1999) which have been converted into 2,278,896 shares of the Common Stock of the Company. On March 30, 2001, the Company borrowed $800 million for a period of three years under a bank term loan agreement with 28 domestic and international banks. The term loan is due on March 30, 2004. The Company may prepay the loan without penalty at the end of any interest period. The loan bears interest at a floating rate at a spread over LIBOR for interest periods of 1,2,3,6 or 12 months, as selected by the Company. Proceeds from the borrowing were used to repay short term debt. The Company issued $650 million of its 7.857% Notes due 2011 in the third quarter of 2001. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes was used to repay outstanding commercial paper and short term bank borrowings. The remaining portion was retained for general corporate purposes. During the third quarter of 2001, the Company issued 4.3 million shares of its common stock with a market value of approximately $100.0 million as a contribution to certain domestic pension plans. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.12 per share, a reduction of $.18 per share from the $.30 per share declared and paid in each quarter of 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001. The Boards decision to reduce the dividend was in response to current economic and business conditions and Goodyears operating results. On February 6, 2001, Sumitomo converted the Companys 1.2% Convertible Note Due August 16, 2001 in the principal amount of 6,536,535,767 into 1,140,866 shares of the Common Stock of the Company. Credit Sources Substantial short term and long term credit sources are available to Goodyear globally under normal commercial practices. In total, Goodyear had credit arrangements of $6.1 billion available at December 31, 2001, of which $2.6 billion were unused. At December 31, 2001, Goodyear had short term committed and uncommitted bank credit arrangements totaling $1.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion were unused. Goodyear also had available long term credit arrangements at December 31, 2001 totaling $4.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion were unused. The Company is a party to two revolving credit facility agreements, consisting of a $750 million five year revolving credit facility and a $775 million 364 day revolving credit facility. The $750 million five year credit facility agreement is with 26 domestic and international banks and provides that the Company may borrow at any time until August 15, 2005, when the commitment terminates and any outstanding loans mature. The Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 12.5 to 25 basis points on the entire amount of the commitment (whether or not borrowed) and a usage fee on amounts borrowed (other than on a competitive bid or prime rate basis) ranging from 37.5 to 125 basis points over LIBOR (or 50 to 137.5 basis points over a defined CD rate). These fees may fluctuate quarterly within these ranges based upon Goodyears leverage. During 2001, commitment fees averaged 19.5 basis points. The $775 million 364 day credit facility agreement is with 26 domestic and international banks and provides that the Company may borrow until August 13, 2002, on which date the facility commitment terminates, except as it may be extended on a bank by bank basis. If a bank does not extend its commitment if requested to do so, the Company may obtain from such bank a two year term loan up to the amount of such banks commitment. The Company pays a 49 Table of Contents commitment fee ranging from 10 to 20 basis points on the entire amount of the commitment (whether or not borrowed) and a usage fee on amounts borrowed (other than on a competitive bid or prime rate basis) ranging from 40 to 130 basis points over LIBOR (or 52.5 to 142.5 basis points over a defined CD rate). These fees may fluctuate quarterly within these ranges based upon Goodyears leverage. During 2001, commitment fees averaged 14.6 basis points. Each of the bank credit facilities provides that the Company may obtain loans bearing interest at reserve adjusted LIBOR or a defined certificate of deposit rate, plus in each case the applicable usage fee, at rates based on the prime rate, or at rates determined on a competitive bid basis. Under each of the facility agreements, a utilization fee of 25 basis points per annum is charged each day on which the sum of the outstanding loans exceeds 50% of the total commitment. No utilization fees were paid during 2001. Each facility agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, require Goodyear to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a minimum consolidated net worth and a defined minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the facility agreements establish a limit on the aggregate amount of consolidated debt the Company and its subsidiaries may incur. There were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements at December 31, 2001. These revolving credit facilities support, among other things, the uncommitted short term bank facilities. The Company amended each of these bank credit facility agreements and certain other agreements with banks during 2001 to modify the interest coverage ratio and consolidated net worth covenants and certain other provisions to reflect current operating conditions. Standard Poors and Fitch have reduced their ratings of the Companys short term and long term debt to B/BB, which are below investment grade. Although the Companys debt is rated P 3/Baa3 by Moodys Investor Services, the Company has been advised by Moodys that the Companys ratings are under review for a possible future reduction to a rating below investment grade. As a result of these ratings actions, Goodyear will not be able to participate in certain capital markets and is likely to experience increases in the cost of obtaining capital in other markets. In addition, financing and related expenses under some existing arrangements have increased. For further information on financing activities, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. Funds generated by operations, together with funds available under existing credit arrangements, are expected to be sufficient to meet Goodyears currently anticipated requirements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk Goodyear actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix, within defined limitations, using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps. Goodyear will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce Goodyears risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates, and are normally designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used by Goodyear to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision. At December 31, 2001, the interest rate on 75% of Goodyears debt was fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate contracts, compared to 54% at December 31, 2000. Interest rate lock contracts are used to hedge the risk free rate component of anticipated long term debt issuances. No interest rate lock contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2001 or 2000. 50 Table of Contents The following tables present information at December 31: (In millions) 2001 2000 Interest Rate Exchange Contracts Fair value (unfavorable) $ (9.2 ) $ Carrying amount: Long term asset .2 Current (liability) (8.3 ) (.2 ) Long term (liability) (1.1 ) Pro forma fair value (unfavorable) (10.6 ) (.2 ) The pro forma information assumes a 10% decrease in variable market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. (In millions) 2001 2000 Fixed Rate Debt Fair value $ 2,359.0 $ 1,731.0 Carrying amount 2,353.3 1,776.5 Pro forma fair value 2,458.3 1,801.3 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity to changes in interest rates of Goodyears interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis. The model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve, and the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk In order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows, Goodyear was a party to various foreign currency forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2001 and 2000. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and Goodyears foreign currency denominated borrowings in the U.S. The contract maturities match the maturities of the currency positions. Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged positions. The following table presents information at December 31: (In millions) 2001 2000 Fair value favorable (unfavorable) $ (13.0 ) $ 24.0 Carrying amount asset (liability) (13.6 ) 23.0 Pro forma change in fair value favorable 44.6 33.3 The pro forma information assumes a 10% change in foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity to changes in exchange rates of Goodyears foreign currency positions was determined using current market pricing models. For further information on interest rate contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 51 Table of Contents
