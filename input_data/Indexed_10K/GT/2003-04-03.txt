ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (All per share amounts are diluted) CONSOLIDATED Net sales in 2002 were $13.85 billion, compared to $14.15 billion in 2001 and $14.42 billion in 2000. A net loss of $1.11 billion, $6.62 per share, was recorded in 2002, primarily resulting from a non cash charge of $1.08 billion to establish a valuation allowance against Goodyears net Federal and state deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes. A net loss of $203.6 million, $1.27 per share, was recorded in 2001 and net income of $40.3 million, $.25 per share, was recorded in 2000. Net Sales Goodyears worldwide tire unit sales in 2002 were 214.3 million units, a decrease of 5.0 million units or 2.3% compared to 2001. North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) volume decreased 8.1 million units or 7.2% in 2002, while international unit sales increased 3.1 million units or 2.9%. Worldwide replacement unit sales decreased 4.9% from 2001, due to decreases in North American Tire and European Union Tire. Original equipment unit sales increased 4.0% in 2002, due to increases in all regions except Latin American Tire and Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire. Unit sales in 2002 included approximately 500 thousand tires in connection with the Ford Motor Company (Ford) tire replacement program, compared to approximately 5 million in 2001. Goodyears worldwide tire unit sales in 2001 were 219.3 million units, a decrease of 4.0 million units or 1.8% compared to 2000. North American Tire volume decreased 3.9 million units or 3.4% in 2001, while international unit sales decreased .1 million units or .1%. Worldwide replacement unit sales decreased 1.6% in 2001, primarily in European Union Tire, Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire and Latin American Tire. Original equipment unit sales were 2.2% lower in 2001, primarily in North American Tire and Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire. Revenues decreased 2.1% in 2002 primarily due to lower tire unit volume, lower revenues as a result of the sale of the Specialty Chemical Business in the fourth quarter 2001 and the effects of currency translation on international results. The Specialty Chemical Business contributed approximately $127 million of sales in 2001. Goodyear estimates that versus 2001, currency movements adversely affected revenues in 2002 by approximately $74 million. Revenues were favorably affected by tire pricing improvements. Revenues decreased 1.9% in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to lower tire unit sales and the effect of currency translation on international results. Goodyear estimates that versus 2000, currency translation adversely affected revenues by approximately $395 million. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was 81.7% of sales in 2002, compared to 82.1% in 2001 and 80.7% in 2000. CGS in 2002 benefited by approximately $206 million from lower raw material costs and other purchasing savings. CGS also decreased as a result of lower sales volume compared to 2001 and the impact of the sale of the Specialty Chemical Business, which contributed approximately $103 million of CGS in 2001. CGS was also unfavorably impacted by $10 million related to the return of tires previously sold by Goodyear to Penske Automotive Centers. On April 6, 2002, Penske Automotive Centers announced plans to close its 563 stores in the United States. Annual sales to Penske totaled approximately $60 million. CGS benefited by approximately $34 million due to currency movements. Compared to 2001, CGS in 2002 was adversely affected by lower demand and approximately $60 million in higher unit costs primarily resulting from significantly lower levels of plant utilization. In addition, 2001 CGS included a charge of $30 million for a proactive tire replacement program covering certain tires in service on 15 passenger vans and ambulances. 23 Table of Contents Compared to 2000, CGS in 2001 reflected higher unit conversion costs resulting from lower levels of plant utilization as Goodyear reduced finished goods inventory levels, as well as higher raw material costs. Production cutbacks relative to 2000 levels resulted in higher unit costs due to less efficient absorption of approximately $320 million of fixed costs during 2001. Costs were favorably impacted by the effects of the previous rationalization actions and ongoing cost containment measures. Research and development expenses are included in CGS and were $380.0 million in 2002, compared to $375.5 million in 2001 and $423.1 million in 2000. Research and development expenditures in 2003 are expected to be approximately $365 million. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) in 2002 was 16.1% of sales, compared to 15.9% in 2001 and 15.5% in 2000. SAG decreased in dollars in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of the absence of expenses for amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of approximately $19 million due to Goodyears adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SAG also decreased as a result of the impact of the sale of the Speciality Chemical Business, which contributed approximately $12 million of SAG in 2001. In addition, reductions in media expense of approximately $20 million (including advertising and administrative expenses), reductions in warehousing and distribution costs in North America of approximately $18 million, reductions in computer related charges of approximately $12 million and cost reduction programs also benefited SAG. SAG was adversely impacted by increased wage and benefit costs of approximately $58 million in 2002 compared to 2001. SAG increased in dollars and as a percent to sales in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increased warehousing and distribution costs in North America. SAG decreased in all international strategic business units (SBUs) due to cost containment initiatives and the favorable effect on SAG of foreign currency exchange rates in 2001. Other Financial Information Net income (loss) in 2001 and 2000 included expenses related to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives totaling $29.0 million and $28.3 million, respectively. In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ceased at January 1, 2002. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. During 2002, Goodyear announced the suspension of the matching contribution portion of its savings plans for all salaried associates, effective January 1, 2003. In April 2003, Goodyears master contract with the United Steelworkers of America will expire, at which time the Company plans to suspend the matching contribution portion of the savings plan for those employees covered by that contract. Goodyear contributed approximately $38 million to the savings plans in 2002. In addition, the Company changed its vacation policy for domestic salaried associates in 2002. As a result of the changes to the policy, the Company will not incur vacation expense for domestic salaried associates in 2003. Vacation expense is expected to be reduced by approximately $50 million due to this change in vacation policy. Revenues in future periods may continue to be adversely affected by competitive pricing conditions and changes in product mix and channels of distribution. Revenues and earnings in future periods are likely to be unfavorably impacted if the dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies. In addition, lower demand from the original equipment industry, loss of market share in the replacement market and increases in raw material, energy and labor costs, which may not be recoverable in the market due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market, may also adversely affect earnings in future periods. Currency fluctuations, increased financing costs and general economic and industry conditions may also adversely impact sales and earnings in future periods. 24 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense in 2002 was $241.3 million, compared to $292.4 million in 2001 and $282.6 million in 2000. Interest expense decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to both lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Interest expense increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to higher average debt levels. Other (Income) and Expense Other (income) and expense was $25.8 million in 2002, compared to $11.8 million in 2001 and $27.8 million in 2000. Other (income) and expense included accounts receivable sales fees and commitment fees totaling $46.0 million, $53.3 million and $43.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other (income) and expense in 2002 also included gains of $25.7 million ($22.0 million after tax or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of land and buildings in the Latin American Tire, Engineered Products and European Union Tire Segments. The writeoff of a miscellaneous investment of $4.1 million ($4.1 million after tax or $.02 per share) was also included in Other (income) and expense in 2002. Other (income) and expense in 2001 included gains of $17.0 million ($13.9 million after tax or $.09 per share) resulting from the sale of land and buildings in the European Union Tire Segment and $27.4 million ($16.9 million after tax or $.10 per share) resulting from the sale of Goodyears Specialty Chemical Business. Other (income) and expense in 2000 included a gain of $5.0 million ($3.2 million after tax or $.02 per share) on the sale of land at a manufacturing facility in the Latin American Tire Segment. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 3, Other (Income) and Expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Foreign currency exchange gain was $10.2 million in 2002, compared to a loss of $.1 million in 2001 and a gain of $6.7 million in 2000. Foreign currency exchange in 2002 benefited by approximately $16 million from currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Brazil. A loss of approximately $8 million resulting from currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Argentina was also incurred in 2002. Equity in (Earnings) Losses of Affiliates Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates was $8.8 million in 2002, compared to $40.6 million and $22.4 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates improved in 2002 compared to 2001 and 2000 due to the rationalization charges incurred in 2001 and 2000 by South Pacific Tyres, Ltd. (SPT), an Australian tire manufacturer in which Goodyear owns a 50% equity interest. Goodyears share of a net rationalization credit recorded by SPT was $1.1 million ($1.1 million after tax or $.01 per share) in 2002. Goodyears share of rationalization charges recorded by SPT in 2001 and 2000 totaled approximately $24.0 million ($24.0 million after tax or $.15 per share) and $16.1 million ($10.5 million after tax or $.07 per share), respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2002 was significantly more than the U.S. statutory rate due to a non cash charge of $1.08 billion ($6.48 per share) to establish a valuation allowance against net Federal and state deferred tax assets. Goodyear had a tax benefit at an effective rate of 25.4% for 2001. Goodyears effective tax rate was 20.0% in 2000. In 2002, Goodyear also determined that earnings of certain international subsidiaries would no longer be permanently reinvested in working capital. Accordingly, Goodyear recorded a provision of $50.2 million for the incremental taxes incurred or to be incurred upon inclusion of such earnings in Federal taxable income. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 15, Income Taxes. 25 Table of Contents Rationalization Activity To maintain global competitiveness, Goodyear has implemented rationalization actions over the past several years for the purpose of reducing excess capacity, eliminating redundancies and reducing costs. Goodyear recorded net rationalization costs of $8.6 million in 2002, $206.8 million in 2001 and $124.1 million in 2000. Goodyear has reduced employment levels by approximately 12,000 from December 31, 2000 and almost 21,000 since 1998, primarily as a result of rationalization activities. 2003 Actions Goodyear expects to record a rationalization charge of approximately $62 million to $68 million in the first quarter of 2003. These actions consist of retail and administrative consolidations in North America and Europe and provide for the release of approximately 900 associates. Of the estimated charge, approximately $36 million to $40 million relates to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance costs, and $26 million to $28 million are non cash charges, primarily the writeoff of equipment taken out of service and pension curtailments. The Company is in the process of finalizing the costs of these plans. Upon completion of these plans, the Company estimates that it will further reduce annual operating costs by approximately $50 million to $60 million. 2002 Program Goodyear recorded a net rationalization charge of $8.6 million ($8.8 million after tax or $.05 per share) in 2002, which included reversals of $17.9 million ($14.2 million after tax or $.09 per share) for reserves from rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes and new charges of $26.5 million ($23.0 million after tax or $.14 per share). The 2002 rationalization actions consisted of a manufacturing facility consolidation in Europe, the closure of a mold manufacturing facility and a plant consolidation in the United States and administrative consolidations. Of the $26.5 million charge, $24.2 million related to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance costs, and $2.3 million related to a non cash writeoff of equipment taken out of service in the Engineered Products and North American Tire Segments. Goodyear estimates that, upon completion of these actions, it will further reduce annual operating costs by approximately $75 million (approximately $45 million CGS and approximately $30 million SAG). The reversals are primarily the result of lower than initially estimated associate related payments of approximately $6.0 million, lower lease cancellation fees in the European Union of approximately $6.0 million and sublease contract signings in North America of approximately $3.0 million. Also included in the reversals is $1.7 million, which represents a portion of a legal reserve related to a previous rationalization plan in the Asia region, determined to be no longer necessary as a result of a court ruling in Goodyears favor. These reversals do not represent a change in the plan originally approved by management. Goodyear plans to complete these actions during 2003. The 2002 actions included associate related costs of $20.3 million for the release of approximately 1,000 manufacturing and administrative associates in Europe and the United States. Rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaled $6.2 million and were primarily for the writeoff of equipment taken out of service in the Engineered Products and North American Tire Segments and noncancellable contract costs. Goodyear incurred $2.7 million of associate related costs during 2002 for the release of approximately 250 associates and $2.9 million of other than associate related costs, primarily for the writeoff of equipment taken out of service. The remaining reserve for costs related to the completion of these actions was $20.7 million at December 31, 2002. Fourth Quarter 2001 Program Goodyear recorded a net rationalization charge totaling $127.8 million ($101.2 million after tax or $.62 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2001, which included a $4.1 million reversal of reserves no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. These actions were in response to continued competitive conditions in the markets served by Goodyear and worldwide economic uncertainty. Under these actions, Goodyear provided for worldwide associate reductions through retail and administrative consolidation and manufacturing plant downsizing and consolidation. 26 Table of Contents The 2001 fourth quarter actions included associate related costs of $53.1 million for the release of approximately 2,200 associates around the world, primarily production and administrative associates in Europe. To date, approximately 2,000 associates have been released. $41.0 million was incurred in 2002 for the release of 1,700 associates. Rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaled $78.8 million, of which $40.0 million related to the writeoff of tire manufacturing equipment taken out of service, principally in the Asia Tire Segment, and noncancellable lease contracts. Goodyear incurred $4.9 million of other than associate related costs in 2002, primarily for lease termination costs. During 2002, Goodyear reversed $15.8 million of reserves, from the fourth quarter 2001 program, no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. Of the $15.8 million reversal, $5.4 million was primarily the result of lower than initially estimated associate related payments, including associates who exited on their own accord prior to implementation of the plan, and $10.4 million was primarily the result of lower than initially estimated lease cancellation fees in the European Union, sublease contracts signed in North America and a favorable court ruling in Asia. The remaining reserve for costs related to the completion of these actions was $26.1 million and $87.8 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Goodyear plans to complete these actions during the second quarter of 2003. When the fourth quarter 2001 program was approved, Goodyear estimated that, upon completion of the program, annual operating costs would be reduced by approximately $85 million, primarily in lower compensation and benefit costs. Goodyear estimated that these savings would result in reductions of $40 million in CGS, of which $5 million related to depreciation, and $45 million in SAG. Goodyear estimates that operating costs were reduced by approximately $41 million in 2002 as a result of the implementation of this program. Plan savings have been substantially offset by higher conversion costs including increased compensation and benefit costs. First Quarter 2001/2000 Program Goodyear recorded a rationalization charge totaling $119.4 million ($94.9 million after tax or $.60 per share) during the third and fourth quarters of 2000. These 2000 actions were for global workforce reductions and manufacturing facility consolidations including the closure of a tire plant in Latin America. Goodyear recorded a rationalization charge totaling $79.0 million ($57.1 million after tax or $.36 per share) in the 2001 first quarter. Of the $79.0 million charge, $12.5 million related to the closure of Goodyears manufacturing facility in Italy announced in 1999 and $66.5 million continued the rationalization program announced in 2000. Pursuant to the program recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001, Goodyear has released approximately 7,100 associates to date. $5.0 million was incurred in 2002 for the release of approximately 300 associates. Rationalization costs, other than associate related costs, totaling $1.8 million, were incurred during 2002 for ongoing payments under noncancellable lease contracts. These programs are substantially complete with the exception of ongoing associate severance and noncancellable lease payments. The remaining reserve for costs related to the completion of these actions totaled $2.5 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. When the first quarter 2001/2000 program was approved, Goodyear estimated that upon completion of the program, annual pretax savings would be approximately $260 million (approximately $200 million of CGS and approximately $60 million of SAG). These savings are the result of lower compensation and benefit costs related to associates who were released in accordance with the program. Plan savings have been substantially offset by higher conversion costs including increased compensation and benefit costs. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 2, Rationalizations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES General Market Uncertainties Goodyears results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or from the original equipment industry, which would result in lower levels of plant utilization that would increase unit costs. Also, Goodyear could experience unexpected higher raw material and energy prices in future periods. These costs, if incurred, may not be 27 Table of Contents recoverable due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market. Goodyear is unable to predict future currency fluctuations. Sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies. A continuation of the current economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe is likely to unfavorably impact Goodyears sales and earnings in future periods. Similarly, continued volatile economic conditions in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods. Goodyear may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including war, acts of terror and civil obstructions. On April 19, 2003, Goodyears master contract with the United Steelworkers of America will expire. It is uncertain at this time whether an agreement will be reached without interruption of production, and the terms of the agreement ultimately reached could result in higher wage and benefit costs in the United States. Critical Accounting Policies, Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of intangibles and other long lived assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, warranty, workers compensation, litigation, general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, and various other operating allowances and accruals, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. The ultimate liability of Goodyear in respect of the various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings to which it is a party cannot be estimated with certainty. Goodyears accounting policy is to determine whether a liability should be recorded, and to estimate the amount of such liability based on the information available and assumptions and methods it has concluded are appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. As additional information becomes available, Goodyear will reassess its evaluation of the pending claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. At December 31, 2002, Goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling $229.1 million ($218.7 million at December 31, 2001) for potential product liability and other tort claims, including related legal fees expected to be incurred, presently asserted against Goodyear. Generally, the amount recorded was determined on the basis of an assessment of the potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and, where available, current trends. Goodyear has established a liability, as part of its general and product liability, in respect of the approximately 97,000 asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2002 (approximately 62,000 claims at December 31, 2001), and an asset for expected recoveries under coverage in place agreements with certain primary insurance carriers. The claims relate to alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber coated products manufactured by Goodyear in the past or to asbestos in certain Goodyear facilities. During 2002, Goodyear received approximately 36,500 new asbestos claims and resolved approximately 1,500 asbestos claims, compared to approximately 18,000 new claims and 9,500 claims resolved in 2001. The amount spent on asbestos litigation defense and claim resolution (before recovery of insurance proceeds) was $19.3 million during 2002 compared to $15.5 million during 2001. The portion of the recorded liabilities relating to asbestos claims is based on pending claims only. The amount recorded reflects an estimate of the cost of defending and resolving pending claims, based on available information and our experience in disposing of asbestos claims in the past. No liability has been recorded for unknown asbestos claims, and Goodyear cannot predict the number of future asbestos claims, the ultimate cost of disposing of existing and future claims, or the future ability to recover from insurance carriers. Goodyear believes it will recover a substantial portion of its liability from the proceeds of existing insurance policies, most of which are not subject to coverage in place agreements. 28 Table of Contents Goodyear also has claims asserted in other legal proceedings to which it is currently a party. The Company appealed judgments of $22.7 million and $1.3 million in civil actions in Colorado State Court, related to alleged breaches of warranties and defects in the Companys Entran II hose installed as a part of Heatway radiant heating systems in the property of the claimants. The Company believes the verdicts were based on material errors of fact and law. The Company is also a defendant in eight class actions and five other civil actions in various Federal and state courts related to the Companys Entran II hose installed in the homes or other structures of the claimants. The Company is also party to a class action relating to alleged breaches of warranty or product defects relating to certain of Goodyears Load Range D and E light truck tires. Goodyears recorded liability for general and product liability (other than asbestos claims) is based on assumptions about the number of claims filed and expected to be filed and the amount expected to be paid per claim. The expected number of claims is developed based in part on industry statistics and past claims experience. The amount expected to be paid per claim is based in part on whether the claim involves Goodyears products or other alleged tort liability. It also includes assumptions about future judicial actions related to the potential aggregation of claims, expected trends in litigation costs and the nature of claims not yet received or reviewed by Goodyear. If the actual experience differs from expectations, Goodyears results of operations, financial position and liquidity would be affected. Subject to the uncertainties referred to above, Goodyear has concluded that in respect of any of the above described liabilities, it is not reasonably possible that it would incur a loss exceeding the amount currently accrued for at December 31, 2002, with respect thereto which would be material relative to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of Goodyear at December 31, 2002, although an unanticipated adverse final determination in these proceedings could have a material impact on Goodyears results of operations, financial position and liquidity in any quarter or for the year. Environmental Matters. At December 31, 2002, Goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling $53.5 million ($66.5 million at December 31, 2001) for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters, primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by Goodyear. These costs include legal and consulting fees, site studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post remediation monitoring and related activities and will be paid over several years. The amount of Goodyears ultimate liability in respect of these matters may be affected by several uncertainties, primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation and the extent to which other responsible parties contribute. Workers Compensation. Goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling $136.7 million and $124.5 million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on Goodyears assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of Goodyears ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. At December 31, 2002, Goodyear had valuation allowances aggregating $1.65 billion against all of its net Federal and state and some of its international subsidiaries deferred tax assets. The net Federal and state deferred tax assets are almost entirely composed of deductions available to reduce Federal and state taxable income in future years. The international deferred tax assets include loss carryforwards as well as deductions available to reduce future international taxable income. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. In accordance with SFAS 109, evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability which are inherently uncertain. Goodyears U.S. losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net Federal and state deferred tax assets under SFAS 109. Goodyear intends to maintain a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the Federal and state deferred tax assets. 29 Table of Contents Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. Goodyears recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions, including future health care costs, maximum company covered benefit costs, life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries. Assumptions about health care costs, life expectancies, retirement rates and future compensation levels are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. Discount rates are based on market indicators at the time these assumptions are established. The expected return on plan assets is determined using historical compound annualized returns of Goodyears pension fund for 15 or more years. These assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate, and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of Goodyears recorded expenses for these benefits. If the actual experience differs from expectations, Goodyears financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate projected benefit obligation for Goodyears pension plans was $5.83 billion. A 25 basis point change in the U.S. discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income by approximately $100 million and would impact pension expense in 2003 by approximately $9 million. As of December 31, 2002, Goodyears accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $2.61 billion. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate for its main U.S. plans would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $50 million and would impact 2003 postretirement benefit expense by approximately $2 million. Effective January 1, 2003, Goodyear has reduced its expected return on U.S. pension plan assets from 9.5% to 8.5% to reflect lower expectations for long term investment returns. This change is expected to increase pension expense approximately $25 million for the year. Amortization of existing losses is expected to increase pension expense substantially in future periods. The investment mix of the U.S. pension assets is typically approximately 70% equities and 30% bonds. Goodyears U.S. pension asset returns were a negative 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The unfunded amount of Goodyears benefit obligation at December 31, 2002 was $2.23 billion, compared to $1.04 billion at December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Goodyear incurred a $1.26 billion charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for unfunded pension benefit obligations, compared to a $235.4 million charge for the year ended December 31, 2001. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, these charges could continue to increase in future periods. Although subject to change in view of the volatility of the capital markets, based on current estimates, Goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately $375 million to $425 million in 2004 in order to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements. Goodyear will be subject to additional statutory minimum funding requirements after 2004. The amount of funding requirements could be substantial and will be based on a number of factors, including the value of the pension assets at the time as well as the interest rate for the relevant period. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (SFAS 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 requires companies to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The amount recorded as a liability will be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, which is then depreciated over its useful life. SFAS 143 became effective for Goodyear on January 1, 2003. Goodyear does not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (SFAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS 146 are 30 Table of Contents effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Goodyear does not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires disclosures by guarantors about the nature of, and maximum potential payments under, contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party under certain circumstances (such as financial guarantees and product warranties). FIN 45 also requires the recognition by guarantors of a liability, at fair value, for the obligation to stand ready to perform under the terms of the contract. The recognition provisions of FIN 45 do not apply to product warranties. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for periods ending after December 15, 2002. The recognition provisions are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Goodyear does not expect the adoption of FIN 45 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 22, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires companies to consolidate, at fair value, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which they hold a controlling financial interest through means other than the majority ownership of voting equity. Controlling financial interests typically are present when a company either 1) has the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the VIEs activities, 2) holds an obligation to absorb expected losses of a VIE, or 3) is entitled to receive the expected residual returns of a VIE. FIN 46 requires disclosures by companies, effective with financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, about the nature, purpose, size and activities of VIEs covered by its provisions, and their maximum exposure to loss. FIN 46 also requires companies to consolidate VIEs created before February 1, 2003, in financial statements for periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is a party to lease agreements with two unrelated special purpose entities (SPEs) that are VIEs as defined by FIN 46. The agreements are related to certain North American distribution facilities and certain corporate aircraft. The fair value of the assets and liabilities, and the Companys maximum exposure to loss prior to insurance recoveries, is approximately $30 million in each SPE. Upon consolidation of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these SPEs, the Company expects its property, plant and equipment and long term debt to each increase by approximately $60 million. Financing costs recognized in the Companys financial statements are not expected to change significantly. Financing costs related to these two SPEs are currently included in SAG, and will be recognized prospectively as Interest Expense upon the consolidation of the SPEs. Wingfoot A/R LLC, a qualified SPE that purchases certain of the Companys domestic accounts receivable, is excluded from the scope of FIN 46 as it is accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (SFAS 140), Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects the strategic business units of Goodyear, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. The Tire business is managed on a regional basis. Engineered Products and Chemical Products are managed on a global basis. Results of operations in the Tire and Engineered Products Segments were measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Results of operations of the Chemical Products Segment were measured based on net sales (including sales to other SBUs) and segment operating income. Segment operating income included transfers to other SBUs. Segment operating income was computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS and SAG (excluding corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also included equity (earnings) losses in affiliates. Segment operating income did not include the previously discussed rationalization charges and certain other items. 31 Table of Contents Segment operating income was $420.3 million in 2002, $366.7 million in 2001 and $599.0 million in 2000. Segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2002 was 2.9%, compared to 2.5% in 2001 and 4.0% in 2000. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 19, Business Segments.

Replacement unit sales in 2002 decreased 12.5% from 2001 and 12.3% from 2000. Original equipment volume in 2002 increased 5.5% from 2001 and decreased 6.4% from 2000. Revenues in 2002 decreased 6.3% from 2001 and 5.7% from 2000. Sales in 2002 decreased compared to 2001 due to reduced volume in certain segments of the replacement market and the lower tire units delivered in connection with the Ford tire replacement program initiated in 2001. Unfavorable product mix also negatively impacted sales compared to 2001. Sales were favorably affected by increased sales to original equipment manufacturers in 2002 as automakers increased production. During 2002, Goodyear supplied approximately 500 thousand tire units with a segment operating income benefit of approximately $10 million in connection with the Ford tire replacement program. Ford ended the replacement program on March 31, 2002. During 2001, Goodyear supplied approximately 5 million tire units with a segment operating income benefit of approximately $95 million in connection with the Ford replacement program. Revenues in 2001 increased compared to 2000 due to the favorable impact of a change in product mix to higher priced tires, price increases in the replacement market and units delivered in connection with the Ford tire replacement program for certain light truck tires of a competitor. Sales were adversely affected in 2001 by lower original equipment volume resulting from production cutbacks by the manufacturers of automobiles and commercial trucks that Goodyear supplies, and lower volume in the replacement market during the fourth quarter, as economic conditions deteriorated. As previously mentioned, during 2001 Goodyear supplied approximately 5 million tire units with a segment operating income impact of approximately $95 million in connection with the Ford tire replacement program. North American Tire segment operating income decreased substantially from 2001 due to lower tonnage and higher plant compensation costs and operating expenses of approximately $155 million. Segment operating income was also negatively impacted by lower replacement sales volume, including the Ford program, of approximately $150 million. Product mix, primarily replacement consumer and commercial, unfavorably impacted segment operating income by approximately $33 million as did the impact of the $10 million charge related to the closure of Penske Automotive Centers in the United States on April 6, 2002. Segment operating income in 2002 was favorably impacted by a decrease in raw material costs of approximately $120 million and in SAG expenses of approximately $28 million. In addition, 2001 included a charge of $30 million for a proactive tire replacement program covering certain tires in service on 15 passenger vans and ambulances. Segment operating income in 2001 decreased from 2000 due to higher unit conversion costs resulting from lower levels of plant utilization, higher raw material costs, higher SAG costs, lower sales volume and the charge for Goodyears tire replacement program. Segment operating income was favorably impacted by price increases in the replacement market, a shift in mix to higher margin tires, the Ford replacement program and lower research and development costs. 32 Table of Contents Segment operating income in 2001 and 2000 included expenses related to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives totaling $3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively. In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ceased at January 1, 2002. Segment operating income did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $(1.9) million in 2002, $31.6 million in 2001 and $(.7) million in 2000. Segment operating income in 2002 also did not include the writeoff of a miscellaneous investment totaling $4.1 million. Revenues and segment operating income in the North American Tire Segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, reduced demand in the replacement market, changes in product mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, higher wage and benefit costs and general economic conditions. On April 19, 2003, Goodyears master contract with the United Steelworkers of America will expire. Approximately 8,400 employees or 26% of the segments employees are covered by this contract. It is uncertain at this time whether an agreement will be reached without interruption of production, and the terms of any agreement ultimately reached could result in higher wage and benefit costs in the United States.

December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Consolidated Debt $ 3,642.2 $ 3,568.3 $ 3,585.8 Debt to Debt and Equity 84.8 % 55.5 % 50.6 % Consolidated Debt as stated above at December 31, 2000, did not include the 1.2% Convertible Notes issued to Sumitomo ($56.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2000), which were converted into 2,278,896 shares of common stock of the Company in 2001. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued 693,740 shares of its common stock for $15.9 million in connection with the acquisition of additional shares of its tire manufacturing subsidiary in Turkey. Also during the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued 11.3 million shares of its common stock and recorded $137.9 million as a contribution to certain domestic pension plans. Certain of Goodyears affiliates are restricted from remitting funds to the parent company by means of dividends, advances or loans, primarily due to credit facility restrictions currently in place in those locations. At December 31, 2002, approximately $211 million was restricted, of which approximately $103 million related to affiliates not consolidated. 39 Table of Contents Credit Sources Restructuring and Refinancing of Credit Facilities On April 1, 2003, the Company completed a comprehensive restructuring and refinancing of its bank credit and receivables securitization facilities. After completing the restructuring and refinancing, the Company replaced a total of $2,938 million in finance facilities with a total of $3,345 million of finance facilities including: $750 million Senior Secured U.S. Revolving Credit Facility due April 2005; $645 million Senior Secured U.S. Term Facility due April 2005; $650 million Senior Secured European Facilities due April 2005; and $1.30 billion Senior Secured Asset Backed Facilities due March 2006. With the exception of approximately $700 million in domestic accounts receivable securitizations and $63 million in Canadian accounts receivable securitizations, each of the replaced finance facilities was unsecured. In addition to the restructured facilities, at April 1, 2003, various international subsidiaries of Goodyear had approximately $346 million of available borrowings under non domestic accounts receivable securitization facilities. The Company expects these international accounts receivable securitization facilities to be reduced in the second quarter of 2003 and is evaluating alternatives to replace or restructure them. As of April 1, 2003, Goodyear estimates it has short term committed and uncommitted bank credit agreements totaling approximately $478 million. The continued availability of the uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender, and the Company expects that a portion of these arrangements may be terminated as a result of the restructuring and refinancing. As of April 1, 2003, the Company estimates that the total fees and expenses incurred for the restructuring and refinancing will be approximately $120 million. In addition, the Company will pay a termination fee on the senior secured asset backed facilities at termination estimated to be equal to 100 basis points of the aggregate principal amount. Of these costs, the Company estimates that approximately $15 million will be charged against income in the first quarter of 2003 and the remainder will be charged against income over the term of the agreements. The accounts receivable and debt that are subject to the new $1.30 billion asset backed facilities will be included on Goodyears consolidated balance sheet. Accounts receivable subject to the terminated $763 million domestic and Canadian accounts receivable programs were not included on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. $750 Million Senior Secured U.S. Revolving Credit Facility The Companys amended and restated senior secured $750 million five year revolving credit facility is with 26 domestic and international banks and provides for borrowing up to the $750 million commitment at any time until April 30, 2005. Up to $600 million of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Company pays an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitment under the U.S. five year revolving credit facility. $645 Million Senior Secured U.S. Term Facility The $645 million U.S. term facility is with 33 domestic and international banks and matures on April 30, 2005. The Company may obtain loans under both the U.S. five year revolving credit facility and the U.S. term facility (collectively, the U.S. facilities) bearing interest at LIBOR plus 400 basis points or an alternative base rate (the higher of JPMorgans prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 5 basis points) plus 300 basis points. If loans under the $645 million term facility remain outstanding on April 30, 2004, fees equal to 100 basis points (or 75 basis points if such facility has been reduced to not more than $200 million) shall be paid to each lender on its ratable portion of the amount outstanding under the U.S. facilities. 40 Table of Contents The collateral pledged under the U.S. facilities includes: subject to certain exceptions, all of the capital stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries; perfected first priority security interests in and mortgages on certain property, plant and equipment with a book value of at least $1.00 billion; perfected first priority security interests in and mortgages on substantially all of Goodyears other tangible and intangible assets including real property, equipment, contract rights and intellectual property; and perfected second priority security interests in all accounts receivable and inventory pledged as security under the Companys $1.30 billion senior secured asset backed facilities, cash and cash accounts, and 65% of the capital stock of Goodyear Finance Holding S.A. The indentures for the Companys Swiss franc denominated bonds limit its ability to use its domestic tire and automotive parts manufacturing facilities as collateral for secured debt without triggering a requirement that bond holders be secured on an equal and ratable basis. The manufacturing facilities indicated above will be pledged to ratably secure the Companys Swiss franc denominated bonds to the extent required under the applicable indenture. However, the aggregate amount collateralized by these manufacturing facilities will be limited to 15% of the Companys shareholders equity, in order that the security interests granted to the lenders under the restructured facilities will not be required to be shared with the holders of indebtedness outstanding under the Companys other existing bond indentures. The U.S. facilities contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Companys ability to incur additional secured indebtedness (including, a limit of $275 million in accounts receivable transactions), make investments, and sell assets beyond specified limits. The facilities prohibit Goodyear from paying dividends on its common stock. Goodyear must also maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (as such term is defined in the U.S. facilities) of at least $2.80 billion and $2.50 billion for quarters ending in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and $2.00 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2005. Goodyear also is not permitted to fall below a ratio of 2.25 to 1.00 of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as such terms are defined in the U.S. facilities) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. In addition, Goodyears ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the U.S. facilities) is not permitted to be greater than 4.00 to 1.00 at any time. In addition, the U.S. term facility requires that any amount outstanding under the facility be prepaid with: 75% of the net cash proceeds of any asset sales or dispositions greater than $5.0 million; 50% of net cash proceeds of any sale of the Engineered Products Segment; and 50% of the net cash proceeds of any debt or equity issuances. The U.S. facilities also limit the amount of capital expenditures the Company may make to $360 million, $500 million, and $200 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005 (through April 30), respectively. The amounts of permitted capital expenditures may be increased by the amount of net proceeds retained by the Company from permitted asset sales and equity and debt issuances after application of the prepayment requirement in the U.S. term facility described above. In addition, to the extent the Company does not reach the limit of permitted capital expenditures in any given year, such shortfall may be carried over into the next year. $650 Million Senior Secured European Facilities Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (GDTE) has entered into a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $400 million senior secured term loan facility (collectively, the European facilities). These facilities are with 33 domestic and international banks and mature on April 30, 2005. GDTE pays an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the European revolving facility. GDTE may obtain loans under the European facilities bearing interest at LIBOR plus 400 basis points or an alternative base rate (the higher of JPMorgans prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 5 basis points) plus 300 basis points. If loans under the $645 million U.S. term facility remain outstanding on 41 Table of Contents April 30, 2004, fees equal to 100 basis points (or 75 basis points if such facility has been reduced to not more than $200 million) shall be paid to each lender on its ratable portion of the amount outstanding under each of the European facilities. The collateral pledged under the European facilities includes: all of the capital stock of Goodyear Finance Holding S.A. and certain subsidiaries of GDTE; and a perfected first priority interest in and mortgages on substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of GDTE in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany (and Slovenia if Sava Tires Joint Venture Holding d.o.o. becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of GDTE), including certain accounts receivable, inventory, real property, equipment, contract rights and cash and cash accounts, but excluding certain accounts receivable used in securitization programs. Consistent with the covenants applicable to Goodyear in the U.S. facilities, the European facilities contain certain covenants applicable to GDTE and its subsidiaries which, among other things, limit GDTEs ability to incur additional indebtedness (including a limit of $275 million in accounts receivable transactions), make investments, sell assets beyond specified limits, pay dividends and make loans or advances to Goodyear companies that are not subsidiaries of GDTE. The European facilities also contain certain covenants applicable to the Company identical to those in the U.S. facilities. The European facilities also limit the amount of capital expenditures that GDTE may make to $180 million, $250 million and $100 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005 (through April 30), respectively. Subject to the provisions in the European facilities and agreements with Goodyears joint venture partner, Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. (which include limitations on loans and advances from GDTE to Goodyear and a requirement that transactions with affiliates be consistent with past practices or on arms length terms), GDTE is permitted to transfer funds to Goodyear. Any amount outstanding under the term facility is required to be prepaid with: 75% of the net cash proceeds of all sales and dispositions of assets by GDTE and its subsidiaries greater than $5 million; and 50% of the net cash proceeds of debt and equity issuances by GDTE and its subsidiaries. The U.S. and European facilities can be used, if necessary, to fund ordinary course of business needs, to repay maturing debt, and for other needs as they arise. $1.30 Billion Senior Secured Asset Backed Credit Facilities The Company has also entered into senior secured asset backed credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.30 billion, consisting of a $500 million revolving credit facility and an $800 million term loan facility. These facilities may be increased to not more than $1.60 billion through extensions of, or increases in, commitments by new or existing creditors. The facilities mature on March 31, 2006. Availability under the facilities is limited by a borrowing base equal to the sum of (a) 85% of adjusted eligible accounts receivable and (b) (i) if the effective advance rate for inventory is equal to or greater than 85% of the recovery rate (as determined by a third party appraisal) of such inventory, 85% of the recovery rate of such inventory, or (ii) if the effective advance rate for inventory is less than 85% of the recovery rate, (A) the sum of 35% of eligible raw materials, 65% of adjusted eligible finished goods relating to the North American Tire Segment, and 60% of adjusted eligible finished goods relating to the retail division, Engineered Products Segment and Chemical Products Segment minus (B) a rent reserve equal to three months rent and warehouse charges at facilities where inventory is stored. The calculation of the borrowing base and reserves against inventory and accounts receivable included in the borrowing base are subject to adjustment from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders in their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably), based on the results of ongoing collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. Availability under the facilities is further limited by a $50 million availability block. If at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings under the facilities exceeds the borrowing base, the Company will be required to prepay borrowings sufficient to eliminate the excess or maintain compensating deposits with the agent bank. The facilities are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all accounts receivable and inventory of Goodyear and its domestic and Canadian subsidiaries (excluding 42 Table of Contents accounts receivable and inventory related to the Companys North American joint venture with Sumitomo and Wingfoot Commercial Systems). The facilities contain certain covenants which are materially the same as those in the U.S. facilities, with capital expenditures of $500 million and $150 million permitted in 2005 and 2006 (through March 31), respectively. Terminated or Amended Facilities Until April 1, 2003, the Company was a party to two revolving credit facilities, consisting of a $750 million five year revolving credit facility and a $575 million 364 day revolving credit facility. The Company was also a party to an $800 million term loan agreement, a $50 million term loan agreement, a $700 million accounts receivable facility with respect to its domestic trade accounts receivable and an aggregate of $346 million of non domestic accounts receivable facilities. With the exception of (i) the non domestic accounts receivable facilities, which remain in place as of April 1, 2003 and (ii) the $750 million five year revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated, each of these arrangements was terminated as of April 1, 2003, in connection with the restructuring and refinancing. Terminated or Amended Credit Facilities Prior to being amended and restated, the $750 million five year revolving credit facility was with 26 domestic and international banks and provided for borrowings of up to the $750 million commitment at any time until August 15, 2005, when the commitment was to terminate and any outstanding loans were to mature. During 2002, commitment fees averaged 26.1 basis points. Under the five year revolving credit facility, the Company was permitted to provide up to $200 million of standby letters of credit. The Company provided $199.7 million of standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2002. During 2002, participation fees for the five year revolving credit facility averaged 144 basis points. The $575 million 364 day revolving credit facility, which was an extension of a $775 million facility which expired on August 13, 2002, was with 21 domestic and international banks and provided for borrowings of up to the $575 million commitment at any time until August 12, 2003. During 2002, commitment fees for the 364 day revolving credit facility averaged 18.4 basis points. There were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements at any time during 2002 and therefore no utilization fees were incurred. As of April 1, 2003, there were borrowings of $600 million under the revolving facilities. The $800 million term loan was with 28 domestic and international banks and was scheduled to mature on March 30, 2004. The revolving credit facilities and the term loan contained certain covenants which, among other things, required the Company to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a minimum consolidated net worth and a defined minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the agreements established limits on the aggregate amount of consolidated debt and certain other obligations the Company and its subsidiaries were permitted to incur and on the amount of unfunded benefit obligations permitted under certain of the Companys pension plans. During 2002 and early 2003 there was a series of reductions in the Companys credit ratings, and the Company perceived the possibility that it would not continue to comply with covenants in its financing agreements relating to pension plan funding and minimum net worth in its existing financing agreements. Accordingly, the Company entered into discussions with its lenders regarding amendments of its financing agreements. On December 24, 2002, the Company obtained waivers of the pension funding and net worth covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and term loan agreement. The Company paid fees to the lenders as consideration for their granting the waivers. On March 5, 2003, these waivers were extended to April 4, 2003, and additional fees were paid. Terminated Domestic Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility Until April 1, 2003, Goodyear maintained a program for the continuous sale of substantially all of its domestic trade accounts receivable to Wingfoot A/R LLC, a wholly owned limited liability subsidiary company that is a 43 Table of Contents bankruptcy remote SPE. The results of operations and financial position of Wingfoot A/R LLC are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as provided by SFAS 140. Wingfoot A/R LLC purchased Goodyears receivables with (a) the cash proceeds of borrowings from a group of four bank affiliated issuers of commercial paper, which borrowings ($624.1 million and $580.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively) were secured by the trade accounts receivable purchased from Goodyear, (b) the proceeds of Goodyears equity investment in Wingfoot A/R LLC, and (c) a subordinated note payable to Goodyear. Goodyear paid fees under the program based on certain variable market interest rates and other agreed amounts. These fees were reported as Other (Income) and Expense. Wingfoot A/R LLC was permitted to borrow a maximum of $700 million from the note purchasers. The aggregate amount of Goodyears investments in Wingfoot A/R LLC was $313.1 million and $483.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Wingfoot A/R facility was amended on December 10, 2002. The amendment reduced the rating required to be maintained by the Company for its long term debt discussed above from Ba2/BB to Ba3/BB . In connection with the amendment, the Company agreed to increase the amounts payable to the lenders under the facility and paid fees to the lenders as additional consideration for their granting the amendment. On March 20, 2003, Moodys Investor Services lowered Goodyears senior unsecured debt rating to B1. Although this rating provided the lenders with certain termination rights, the lenders did not seek to terminate the facility and the outstanding borrowings under the facility were retired in connection with the restructuring and refinancing on April 1, 2003. Non Domestic Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities Various international subsidiaries of the Company have also established accounts receivable continuous sales programs whereunder these subsidiaries may receive proceeds from the sale of certain of their receivables. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. At December 31, 2002, the value in U.S. dollars of which these international subsidiaries may borrow is approximately $409 million. As of April 1, 2003, the amount available for borrowing under these facilities was approximately $346 million. The Company expects these facilities to be reduced in the second quarter of 2003 and is evaluating alternatives to replace them. During March 2003, a $63 million accounts receivable facility in Canada was retired. The receivables pledged under the retired Canadian facility now constitute a portion of the collateral pledged under the $1.30 billion senior secured asset backed facility. In addition, various other international subsidiaries of Goodyear sold certain of their trade receivables during 2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2002, the net proceeds for all sales of receivables by Goodyear were $916.1 million. Net cash inflows of $34.8 million were received in 2002 from transfers of accounts receivable under these and other programs. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 4, Accounts and Notes Receivable. Credit Ratings On January 1, 2002, Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor Services rated the Companys long term debt at BBB and Baa3, respectively. During 2002 and early 2003, credit rating agencies reduced the Companys credit rating on short term and long term debt to non investment grade status. As a result of these ratings actions and other related events, the Companys access to the capital markets is limited. In addition, financing and related expenses under some existing arrangements have increased as a result of the Companys non investment grade ratings. On March 20, 2003, Moodys Investors Services assigned a (P)Ba2 long term debt rating to Goodyears then proposed restructured credit facilities. At the same time, Moodys assigned Goodyear a senior implied rating of Ba3, an unsecured long term issuer rating of B1 and lowered Goodyears senior unsecured debt rating to B1. Moodys rating outlook is stable. On April 2, 2003, Standard & Poors affirmed its BB long term debt rating, maintained its negative outlook and lowered the rating on Goodyears unsecured notes to B+. On March 20, 2003, Standard & Poors assigned ratings on the then proposed restructured credit facilities of: BB+ for the $1.30 billion senior secured asset backed credit facility and BB for the U.S. facilities and the European facilities. 44 Table of Contents Dividends On February 4, 2003, the Company announced that it eliminated its quarterly cash dividend. The Company had paid cash dividends at a quarterly rate of $.12 per share since the fourth quarter of 2001, when it was decreased from $.30 per share. The determination of dividend payments is made by the Companys Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The dividend reduction was effected by the Board in order to conserve cash for the Companys business and should result in annual cash savings to the Company of approximately $84 million per year. Under the Companys restructured credit agreements, the Company is not permitted to pay dividends on its common stock. Turnaround Strategy The Company is currently implementing the initial stages of a turnaround strategy for the North American Tire Segment which will require the Company to 1) stabilize margins and market shares, 2) simplify the sales and supply chain process, 3) execute key cost cutting, brand and distribution strategies and 4) grow the business through new product introductions and new sales channels. There is no assurance that the Company will successfully implement this turnaround strategy. In particular, this strategy and the Companys liquidity could be adversely affected by trends that negatively affected the North American Tire Segment in 2002 and prior years, including industry overcapacity which limits pricing power, weakness in the replacement tire market, increased competition from low cost manufacturers and a related decline in Goodyears market share, weak U.S. economic conditions, and increases in medical and pension costs. The Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity could also be adversely affected by events related to the expiration of Goodyears master contract with the United Steelworkers of America and other factors mentioned in the discussion of the North American Tire Segment above. Future Capital Requirements Based upon the Companys projected operating results, the Company believes that cash flow from operations together with available borrowing under its restructured credit facilities and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet the Companys anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through December 31, 2003. Prior to March 2003, the Company had not historically drawn down its revolving credit facilities to meet its liquidity demands. However, during March 2003, the Company did draw down approximately $600 million from its revolving credit facilities. In the future, the Company intends to access its restructured revolving credit facilities to support its liquidity demands on an as needed basis. Based on the Companys operating results and other information available to the Company, the Company expects to be in compliance with the covenants in its revolving credit facilities, term loans and other bank loans through the end of 2003. In the event the Company failed to comply with these covenants, the lenders would have the right to cease further loans to the Company and to demand the repayment of all outstanding loans under these facilities. The Companys $3,345 million of bank finance facilities mature in 2005 and 2006; and the Company would have to refinance these facilities in the capital markets if they were not renewed by the banks. Because of its debt ratings, recent operating performance and other factors, the Company believes its access to such markets at the present is limited. The Companys ability to improve its access to the capital markets is highly dependent on successfully implementing its turnaround strategy. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing its turnaround strategy. Failure to successfully complete the turnaround strategy could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity. For further information on financing activities, refer to the notes to the financial statements No. 10, Financial Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments, and No. 24, Subsequent Events. 45 Table of Contents Commitments & Contingencies The following table presents, at December 31, 2002, Goodyears obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts and contingent commitments. Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2002 (In millions) After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years Years Long Term Debt (1) $ 3,295.8 $ 364.4 $ 5.6 $ 1,329.2 $ 386.3 $ 302.8 $ 907.5 Capital Lease Obligations (2) 101.6 9.8 9.2 7.6 6.8 6.6 61.6 Operating Leases (3) 1,403.6 267.2 221.6 174.8 160.4 105.0 474.6 Binding Commitments (4) 440.3 428.3 9.7 .8 .7 .6 .2 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,241.3 $ 1,069.7 $ 246.1 $ 1,512.4 $ 554.2 $ 415.0 $ 1,443.9 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Other Off Balance Sheet Financial Guarantees Written and Other Commitments (5) $ 77.4 $ 12.8 $ 45.0 $ .8 $ .2 $ 4.9 $ 13.7 (1) Long term debt payments reflect the restructuring and refinancing of the Companys credit facilities on April 1, 2003. (2) The present value of capital lease obligations is $63.0 million. (3) Operating leases do not include minimum sublease rentals of $43.5 million, $34.1 million, $24.2 million, $15.7 million, $9.2 million, and $15.2 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $141.9 million. Net operating lease payments total $1,261.7 million. The present value of operating leases is $761.2 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, computers and office equipment, real estate, and miscellaneous other assets, which are in some instances leased from SPEs owned and controlled by independent, unaffiliated lessors that are owned or financed by financial institutions. At December 31, 2002, the Company was a party to lease agreements with two unrelated SPEs. The agreements are related to certain North American distribution facilities and certain corporate aircraft. Minimum operating lease payments in the above table include approximately $30 million in 2006 related to the distribution facilities. No director, officer or employee of Goodyear or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliate holds any direct or indirect interest in such entities. No asset is leased from any related party. (4) Binding commitments are for normal operations of the Company and include investments in land, buildings and equipment and raw materials purchased through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. (5) Other off balance sheet financial guarantees written and other commitments include, at December 31, 2002, approximately $43.0 million related to an option held by Goodyears minority partner in Sava Tires to require Goodyear to purchase the partners 20% equity interest in Sava Tires. The minority partner may exercise its option during various periods beginning in 2003 and extending through 2005. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which can not be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of Goodyears global alliance with Sumitomo as set forth in the Umbrella Agreement between Goodyear and Sumitomo provide for certain minority exit rights available to Sumitomo commencing in 2009. Sumitomos exit rights, in the unlikely event of exercise, could require Goodyear to make a substantial payment to acquire Sumitomos interest in the alliance. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, Ansell Ltd. (Ansell), formerly Pacific Dunlop Ltd., has the right, during the period beginning August 2005 and ending one year later, to require Goodyear to purchase Ansells 50% interest in SPT at a formula price based on the earnings of SPT. If Ansell does not exercise its right, Goodyear may require Ansell to sell its interest to Goodyear during the 180 days following the expiration of Ansells right at a price established using the same formula. 46 Table of Contents Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, Goodyear shall purchase minimum amounts of carbon black from a certain supplier from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2006, at agreed upon base prices that are subject to quarterly adjustments for changes in raw material costs and natural gas costs and a one time adjustment for other manufacturing costs. Goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately $375 million to $425 million in 2004 in order to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements. The Company does not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. The Company generally purchases raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk Goodyear actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix, within defined limitations, using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps. Goodyear will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce Goodyears risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used by Goodyear to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions. At December 31, 2002, the interest rates on 70% of Goodyears debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts, compared to 75% at December 31, 2001. Goodyear also from time to time enters into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated long term debt issuances.

The sensitivity to changes in interest rates of Goodyears interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis. The model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk In order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows, Goodyear enters into foreign currency contracts. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales. In addition, the principal and interest on Goodyears Swiss franc bond due 2006 and Euro300 million of the Euro Notes due 2005 are hedged by currency swap agreements. Contracts hedging the Swiss franc bond, the Euro Notes and forecasted transactions under intercompany royalty agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. The hedged intercompany royalty transactions will occur during 2003. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. 48 Table of Contents The following table presents foreign currency contract information at December 31: 2002 2001 (In millions) Foreign Exchange Contracts Fair value asset (liability) $64.2 $(13.0 ) Pro forma change in fair value 37.6 44.6 Contract maturities 1/03 12/18 1/02 3/06 Fair value asset (liability): Swiss franc swap current $(2.8 ) $(4.6 ) Swiss franc swap long term 31.6 10.2 Euro swaps current (1.1 ) (5.5 ) Euro swaps long term 27.8 (15.0 ) Other current asset 8.5 2.4 Other current (liability) (1.1 ) The pro forma change in fair value assumes a 10% change in foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. At December 31, 2002, Goodyear held foreign currency Euro put options, exercisable during 2003, to reduce exposure to currency movements on 2003 forecasted intercompany sales. These options are designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2002, the underlying contract value of these options totaled $42.6 million, and the fair value totaled $.2 million. The uncertainty of foreign currency markets in the future precludes the Company from assessing whether or not these options will be exercised. The sensitivity to changes in exchange rates of Goodyears foreign currency positions was determined using current market pricing models.
