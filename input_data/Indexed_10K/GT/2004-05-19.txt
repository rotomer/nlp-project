ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of tires and rubber products with one of the most recognized brand names in the world. We have a broad global footprint with 95 manufacturing facilities in 28 countries. Our business is run through seven operating segments: North American Tire; European Union Tire; Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire; Latin America Tire; Asia Tire; Engineered Products; and Chemical Products. In each of the last three years we have experienced significant net losses. Our net losses for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $802.1 million, $1,227.0 million (as restated and including a non cash charge of $1.20 billion to establish a tax valuation allowance) and $254.1 million (as restated), respectively. Our results are highly dependent upon the results of our North American Tire segment, which accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated net sales in 2003. In recent years, North American Tire results have been negatively impacted by several factors, including over capacity which limits pricing leverage, weakness in the replacement tire market, increased competition from low cost manufacturers, a decline in market share and increases in medical and pension costs. In 2003, North American Tire has a segment operating loss of $128.7 million compared to a segment operating loss of $57.1 million (as restated) for 2002 and segment operating income of $100.9 million (as restated) for 2001. In our second largest segment, European Union Tire, we had segment operating income of $133.5 million, $100.2 million (as restated) and $44.2 million (as restated) in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Approximately 29% of the increase in segment operating income from 2002 to 2003 is attributable to the strength of the Euro. The segment operating income of our five other operating segments has remained strong and has increased each year since 2001. In addition to the disappointing results of our North American Tire segment, increases in raw material and energy costs have offset many of the benefits of the numerous cost reduction actions we have taken over the past year. In particular, in 2003, the price of one of our most important raw materials, natural rubber, increased approximately 36% and the cost of oil increased approximately 25% over the same period. We estimate that the rise in raw material costs increased our Cost of Goods Sold by approximately $335 million in 2003. We expect that the price of oil and natural rubber will continue to increase in 2004. Increased interest expense and financing fees also negatively impacted our results in 2003. Interest expense increased from $241.7 million (as restated) in 2002 to $296.3 million in 2003 primarily due to our refinancing efforts. Fees and expenses related to our refinancing efforts in 2003 totaled approximately $120 million, of which $45.6 million was charged against income in 2003. The amount charged against income in 2003 of $45.6 million included the writeoff of unamortized fees associated with the facilities that were replaced. Financing activities completed in the first quarter of 2004 will further increase our interest expense. A key indicator of our operating performance is market share, especially in our two largest regions, North America and western Europe. Listed below is our estimated market share in each of these two regions for our two primary tire markets: Original Equipment and Replacement. North Western America Europe Estimated Estimated Market Share Market Share 2003 2002 2003 2002 Original Equipment 41.6 % 41.3 % 23.6 % 25.5 % Replacement 25.6 26.2 23.8 23.2 The above percentages are estimates only and are based on a combination of industry publications and surveys and internal company surveys. In the North American replacement market, a significant increase in business in our dealer channel was not enough to offset a large loss in the lower margin private label market primarily due to aggressive competition by low cost foreign manufacturers. The North American original equipment market remained steady even as we became more selective in the fitments we pursued with vehicle manufacturers. In western Europe, the increase in the replacement market was due to the successful 28 Table of Contents introduction of several new products and an increased focus on sales by product. The reduction in our share of the western European original equipment market is largely due to our strategy to be more selective in pursuing original equipment fitments. We refinanced most of our debt on April 1, 2003 with facilities that are secured by a substantial portion of our assets. While we completed additional debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2004, we must take additional actions, including accessing the capital markets or refinancing additional debt, to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity over the long term. For example, we have a number of obligations coming due over the next few years, including substantial required domestic pension plan obligations of approximately $160 million in 2004 and approximately $325 million to $350 million in 2005. In addition, after taking into account the paydown of certain obligations in connection with our recent financing activities, we have an aggregate of $1,343 million and $1,481 million of long term debt coming due in 2005 and 2006, respectively. We expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and borrowings. While new financing may be available to us, access to such financing cannot be assured given the recent performance of our business, our current debt ratings and restrictions on our ability to pledge additional assets as security. Failure to obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Given these and other obligations, unanticipated events could significantly impact our liquidity. For example, although we have entered into a conditional settlement agreement to resolve a substantial portion of product liability claims relating to a rubber hose product we previously manufactured, unless this settlement is finalized, we will be subject to numerous claims, the resolution of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. During the third quarter of 2003, our management and our Audit Committee determined that it was appropriate to restate our previously issued financial results to record adjustments resulting from various accounting matters. The results of an investigation into potential accounting improprieties in our overseas operations led to an additional restatement. The impact of these restatements is described in Note 2 to our Financial Statements. We are currently subject to an SEC investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement. We cannot predict the outcome of the investigation, and any adverse developments in connection with the investigation, including the initiation of an enforcement action, could be costly and could seriously harm our business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (All per share amounts are diluted) CONSOLIDATED Net sales in 2003 were $15.12 billion, compared to $13.86 billion (as restated) in 2002 and $14.16 billion (as restated) in 2001. A net loss of $802.1 million, $4.58 per share, was recorded in 2003. A net loss of $1.23 billion (as restated), $7.35 per share (as restated), was recorded in 2002, primarily resulting from a non cash charge of $1.20 billion (as restated) to establish a valuation allowance against Goodyears net Federal and state deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes. A net loss of $254.1 million (as restated), $1.59 per share (as restated), was recorded in 2001. 29 Table of Contents Net Sales Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In millions of tires) North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 68.6 69.8 79.7 International 82.0 77.9 75.5 Replacement tire units 150.6 147.7 155.2 North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 32.6 34.1 32.3 International 30.3 32.5 31.8 OE tire units 62.9 66.6 64.1 Goodyear worldwide tire units 213.5 214.3 219.3 Goodyears worldwide tire unit sales decreased 0.3% in 2003 compared to 2002. North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) volume decreased 2.5% in 2003, while international unit sales increased 1.7%. Worldwide replacement unit sales increased 2.0% from 2002, due to increases in all regions except North American and Asia Tire. Original equipment unit sales decreased 5.6% in 2003, due to decreases in all regions except Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire and Asia Tire. Goodyears worldwide tire unit sales in 2002 decreased 2.3% compared to 2001. North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) volume decreased 7.2% in 2002, while international unit sales increased 2.9%. Worldwide replacement unit sales decreased 4.9% from 2001, due to decreases in North American Tire and European Union Tire. Original equipment unit sales increased 4.0% in 2002, due to increases in all regions except Latin American Tire and Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire. Unit sales in North American Tire in 2002 included approximately 500 thousand tires in connection with the Ford Motor Company (Ford) tire replacement program, compared to approximately 5 million in 2001. Revenues increased 9.1% in 2003 primarily due to favorable currency translation of approximately $737 million, largely related to the strong Euro. Favorable pricing and product mix in all business units, but primarily in Latin American Tire, Chemical Products and North American Tire, accounted for approximately $418 million of the increase in revenues. In Europe, strong replacement sales also had a favorable impact on 2003 net sales of approximately $104 million. Revenues (as restated) decreased 2.2% in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to lower tire unit volume of approximately $250 million, largely in North American Tire, and the negative impact of currency translation on international results of approximately $102 million (as restated), primarily in Latin American Tire. Revenues in 2002 were also negatively impacted as a result of the sale of the Specialty Chemical Business in the fourth quarter of 2001. The Specialty Chemical Business contributed approximately $127 million of sales in 2001. Revenues were favorably affected by tire pricing and product mix improvements, mainly in Latin American Tire, of approximately $167 million. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was 82.6% of sales in 2003, compared to 81.6% in 2002 and 82.5% in 2001. CGS in 2003 was adversely impacted by approximately $554 million due to currency movements, primarily in Europe, and by approximately $335 million in higher raw material costs, largely natural and synthetic rubber. CGS in 2003 was also unfavorably impacted by approximately $133 million related to accelerated depreciation charges, asset impairment charges and writeoffs, related to the 2003 rationalization actions. Changes in product mix of approximately $184 million, primarily in North American Tire and inflationary cost increases in Latin American Tire also negatively impacted 2003 CGS. Savings from rationalization programs of approximately $61 million, mainly European Union Tire and North American Tire, and the change in vacation policy described below of approximately $33 million favorably impacted 2003 CGS. 30 Table of Contents CGS (as restated) in 2002 benefited by approximately $204 million from lower raw material costs and other purchasing savings. CGS also decreased by approximately $220 million (as restated) as a result of lower sales volume compared to 2001 and the impact of the sale of the Specialty Chemical Business, which contributed approximately $103 million of CGS in 2001. CGS benefited by approximately $82 million (as restated) due to currency movements, primarily in Brazil, Argentina and South Africa partially offset by unfavorable currency movements in European Union and by approximately $30 million due to lower transportation costs in North American Tire. Savings from rationalization programs of approximately $20 million also favorably impacted CGS in 2002. 2002 CGS increased approximately $238 million as a result of changes in product mix, mainly North American Tire and inflationary cost increases in Latin American Tire. CGS was unfavorably impacted by $10 million related to the closure of Penske Automotive Centers in 2002. Compared to 2001, CGS in 2002 was adversely affected by lower demand and approximately $76 million (as restated) in higher unit costs primarily resulting from significantly lower levels of plant utilization. In addition, 2001 CGS included a charge of $30 million for a proactive tire replacement program covering certain tires in service on 15 passenger vans and ambulances. Research and development expenses are included in CGS and were $350.4 million in 2003, compared to $385.8 million (as restated) in 2002 and $371.8 million (as restated) in 2001. Research and development expenditures in 2004 are expected to be approximately $369 million. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) in 2003 was 15.7% of sales, compared to 15.9% in 2002 and 15.7% in 2001. SAG increased in 2003 primarily due to foreign currency translation, mainly the Euro, of approximately $132 million and higher wages and benefits of approximately $72 million. Also negatively impacting SAG was increased advertising expense, largely in European Union Tire and North American Tire, of approximately $29 million and increased corporate consulting fees of approximately $23 million. SAG was favorably impacted by rationalization programs of approximately $74 million and by the change in vacation policy described below of approximately $34 million. SAG (as restated) decreased in dollars in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of the absence of expenses for amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of approximately $19 million due to Goodyears adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SAG also decreased as a result of the impact of the sale of the Specialty Chemical Business, which contributed approximately $12 million of SAG in 2001. In addition, reductions in media expense of approximately $31 million (as restated) (including advertising and administrative expenses), and reductions in computer related charges of approximately $20 million (as restated) also benefited SAG. SAG was adversely impacted by increased wage and benefit costs of approximately $60 million (as restated) in 2002 compared to 2001. Other Financial Information Net loss in 2001 included expenses related to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives totaling $29.1 million before tax (as restated). In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ceased at January 1, 2002. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. During 2002, Goodyear announced the suspension of the matching contribution portion of its savings plans for all salaried associates, effective January 1, 2003. Effective April 20, 2003, the Company suspended the matching contribution portion of the savings plan for bargaining unit associates including those covered by Goodyears master contract with the United Steelworkers of America (USWA). Goodyear contributed approximately $38 million to the savings plans in 2002. In addition, the Company changed its vacation policy for domestic salaried associates in 2002. As a result of the changes to the policy, the Company did not incur vacation expense for domestic salaried associates in 2003. Vacation expense was approximately $67 million lower in 2003 compared to 2002 due to this change in vacation policy. 31 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense in 2003 was $296.3 million, compared to $241.7 million (as restated) in 2002 and $297.1 million (as restated) in 2001. Interest expense increased in 2003 due to higher average debt outstanding. Interest expense decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to both lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. Other (Income) and Expense Other (income) and expense was $267.3 million in 2003, compared to $56.8 million (as restated) in 2002 and $40.8 million (as restated) in 2001. Other (income) and expense included accounts receivable sales fees, debt refinancing fees and commitment fees totaling $99.4 million, $48.4 million and $50.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 in financing fees and financial instruments is due to the costs incurred in connection with the restructuring and refinancing of the Companys bank credit and receivables securitization facilities discussed below. Financing fees and financial instruments included $45.6 million in 2003 related to the new facilities. Refer to Note 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information about the restructuring and refinancing. Goodyear expects to incur additional financing fees in the future related to refinancings or capital market transactions. Other (income) and expense in 2003 included a loss of $17.6 million ($8.9 million after tax or $0.05 per share) on the sale of 20,833,000 shares of Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. (SRI) in the second quarter. 2003 included a loss of $11.6 million ($11.2 million after tax or $0.07 per share) on the sale of assets in the Engineered Products, North American Tire and European Union Tire Segments. 2003 also included a gain of $7.7 million ($6.4 million after tax or $0.04 per share) resulting from the sale of land in the Asia Tire Segment and assets in the Latin American and European Union Tire Segments. Other (income) and expense also includes General and product liability discontinued products which includes charges for claims against Goodyear related to asbestos personal injury claims and for anticipated liabilities related to Entran II claims, primarily for a proposed settlement of such claims. Goodyear recorded net charges for General and product liability discontinued products totaling approximately $145 million in 2003 which included recognition of a receivable of approximately $131 million from Goodyears insurance carriers. Refer to Note 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, for further information about general and product liabilities. Other (income) and expense in 2002 included gains of $28.0 million (as restated) ($23.7 million after tax or $0.14 per share (as restated)) resulting from the sale of land and buildings in the Latin American Tire, Engineered Products and European Union Tire Segments. The writeoff of a miscellaneous investment of $4.1 million ($4.1 million after tax or $0.02 per share) was also included in Other (income) and expense in 2002. Other (income) and expense in 2001 included gains of $18.4 million (as restated) ($14.7 million after tax or $0.09 per share (as restated)) resulting from the sale of land and buildings in the European Union Tire Segment and $27.4 million ($16.9 million after tax or $0.10 per share) resulting from the sale of Goodyears Specialty Chemical Business. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements as restated No. 4, Other (Income) and Expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Foreign currency exchange loss was $40.2 million in 2003, compared to a gain of $9.7 million (as restated) in 2002 and a loss of $10.0 million (as restated) in 2001. Foreign currency exchange in 2003 was adversely impacted by approximately $48 million due to currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Brazil and Chile. Foreign currency exchange in 2002 benefited by approximately $16 million from currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Brazil. A loss of approximately $8 million resulting from currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Argentina was also incurred in 2002. 32 Table of Contents Equity in (Earnings) Losses of Affiliates Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates was $12.1 million in 2003, compared to $13.2 million (as restated) and $39.7 million (as restated) in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates improved in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the rationalization charges incurred in 2001 by South Pacific Tyres (SPT), an Australian tire manufacturer in which Goodyear owns a 50% equity interest. Goodyears share of a net rationalization credit recorded by SPT was $1.1 million ($1.1 million after tax or $0.01 per share) in 2002. Goodyears share of rationalization charges recorded by SPT in 2001 totaled $24.0 million ($24.0 million after tax or $0.15 per share). Income Taxes For 2003, Goodyear recorded tax expense of $112.2 million on a loss before income taxes and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries of $654.9 million. The difference between Goodyears effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily attributable to the Company continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against its net Federal and state deferred tax assets. In 2002, a non cash charge of $1.20 billion (as restated) ($6.86 per share (as restated)) was recorded to establish the valuation allowance against the net Federal and state deferred tax assets. Goodyear had a tax benefit at an effective rate of 24.6% (as restated) for 2001. In 2002, Goodyear also determined that earnings of certain international subsidiaries would no longer be permanently reinvested in working capital. Accordingly Goodyear recorded a provision of $50.2 million for the incremental taxes incurred or to be incurred upon inclusion of such earnings in Federal taxable income. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 14, Income Taxes. Rationalization Activity To maintain global competitiveness, Goodyear has implemented rationalization actions over the past several years for the purpose of reducing excess capacity, eliminating redundancies and reducing costs. Goodyear recorded net rationalization costs of $291.5 million in 2003, $5.5 million (as restated) in 2002 and $210.3 million (as restated) in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, Goodyear has reduced employment levels by approximately 16,400 from December 31, 2000 and almost 25,400 since 1998, primarily as a result of rationalization activities. During 2003, net charges of $291.5 million ($267.1 million after tax or $1.27 per share) were recorded, which included reversals of $15.7 million ($14.3 million after tax or $0.07 per share) for reserves from rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes and new charges of $307.2 million ($281.4 million after tax or $1.34 per share). The 2003 rationalization actions consisted of manufacturing, research and development, administrative and retail consolidations in North America, Europe and Latin America. Of the $307.2 million of new charges, $174.8 million related to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance costs, and $132.4 million related primarily to non cash special termination benefits and pension and retiree benefit curtailments. In 2003, $200.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively, was incurred primarily for severance payments and noncancellable lease costs. Approximately 4,400 associates will be released under the programs initiated in 2003, of which approximately 2,700 were exited in 2003. The majority of the remaining accrual balance for all programs of $141.9 million is expected to be utilized by the end of 2004. As part of the 2003 rationalization program, Goodyear closed its Huntsville, Alabama tire facility in the fourth quarter. Of the $307.2 million of new charges, approximately $138 million related to the Huntsville closure primarily for associate related costs, including severance, special termination benefits and pension and retiree benefit curtailments. The Huntsville closure also resulted in approximately $35 million of asset impairment charges and $85 million of accelerated depreciation charges and the writeoff of spare parts. Approximately $8 million of construction in progress was written off in the first quarter of 2003 related to the research and development rationalization plan. Approximately $5 million of accelerated depreciation charges were recorded for equipment taken out of service in the European Union related to two rationalization plans at 33 Table of Contents Goodyears Wolverhampton facility. These amounts are recorded as CGS on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Goodyear recorded a net rationalization charge totaling $5.5 million (as restated) ($6.4 million after tax or $0.03 per share (as restated)) in 2002, which included reversals of $18.0 million (as restated) ($14.3 million after tax or $0.09 per share (as restated)) for reserves from rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes, new charges of $26.5 million ($23.0 million after tax or $0.14 per share) and other credits of $3.0 million (as restated) ($2.3 million after tax or $0.02 per share (as restated)). The 2002 rationalization actions consisted of a manufacturing facility consolidation in Europe, the closure of a mold manufacturing facility and a plant consolidation in the United States, and administrative consolidations. Of the $26.5 million charge, $24.2 million related to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance costs, and $2.3 million related to a non cash writeoff of equipment taken out of service in the Engineered Products and North American Tire Segments. Goodyear recorded net rationalization charges totaling $210.3 million (as restated) ($161.4 million after tax or $1.00 per share (as restated)) in 2001, which included $4.1 million of reversals of prior year reserves no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. These actions were in response to continued competitive market conditions and worldwide economic uncertainty. Under these actions, Goodyear provided for worldwide associate reductions through retail and administrative consolidation and manufacturing plant downsizing and consolidation. Of this charge, $132.0 million (as restated) related to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance and noncancellable lease costs, and $82.4 million (as restated) related to non cash charges, primarily for the writeoff of equipment taken out of service. Goodyear completed these actions during 2003 with the exception of ongoing severance and noncancellable lease payments. Upon completion of the 2003 plans, the Company estimates that it will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $280 million (approximately $70 million SAG and approximately $210 million CGS). Goodyear estimates that SAG and CGS were reduced in 2003 by approximately $62 million as a result of the implementation of the 2003 plans, approximately $41 million as a result of the implementation of the 2002 plans and approximately $76 million as a result of the implementation of the 2001 plans. Plan savings have been substantially offset by higher SAG and conversion costs including increased compensation and benefit costs. The remaining reserve for costs related to the completion of the Companys rationalization actions was $141.9 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $69.2 million at December 31, 2002. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 3, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. UNION AGREEMENT On September 15, 2003, the United Steelworkers of America (the USWA) and Goodyear announced the ratification of a new labor agreement. The agreement covers workers at 14 tire and engineered products plants in the United States and contains provisions governing healthcare benefits, pension service and wages. The agreement assigns protected plant status to 12 of the 14 plants and permits a 13th plant to achieve protected status if certain productivity goals are met. A protected plant cannot be closed during the duration of the agreement and Goodyear is generally required to maintain the current level of capital expenditures at these plants. The agreement also gives Goodyear the option to reduce the hourly workforce at protected plants by 15% compared to August 2003 staffing levels. Goodyear has also agreed to give USWA plants first consideration on all new products intended for sale in North America to the extent covered plants have the capacity and capability to manufacture the product. Goodyear retains the right to import tires from the Companys plants outside of the United States to the extent the USWA plant that is manufacturing the product is operating at full capacity. Under the agreement, the USWA has the right to nominate an individual for a seat on Goodyears Board of Directors. Goodyear has also agreed to remain neutral should the USWA attempt to organize one of Goodyears non union facilities. Goodyear must also require a buyer of any of Goodyears plants to negotiate a labor agreement as a precondition of the sale. 34 Table of Contents Goodyear also committed under the agreement to consummate the issuance or placement of at least $250 million of debt securities and at least $75 million of equity or equity linked securities by December 31, 2003. Goodyear did not meet this commitment. As a result, the USWA may file a grievance and strike. In the event of a strike, the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Goodyear has also committed to launch, by December 1, 2004, a refinancing of its U.S. term loan and revolving credit facilities due in April 2005 with loans or securities having a term of at least three years. If Goodyear fails to complete this refinancing commitment, the USWA would have the right to strike and Goodyear would be required to pay each covered union employee (approximately 13,700 as of December 31, 2003) $1,000 and each covered union retiree (approximately 13,800 as of December 31, 2003) $500. Finally, Goodyear committed to remain in compliance with the Interest Expense Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Worth, and Senior Secured Indebtedness Ratio covenants in its U.S. revolving credit facility. If Goodyear fails to remain in compliance with these covenants, it has agreed to use its best efforts to seek a substantial private equity investment. Such investment would be expected to provide the investor with significant influence in the management and direction of Goodyear. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES General Market Uncertainties Goodyears results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or from the original equipment industry, which would result in lower levels of plant utilization that would increase unit costs. Also, Goodyear could experience higher raw material and energy prices in future periods. These costs, if incurred, may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market. Goodyear is unable to predict future currency fluctuations. Sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies. A continuation of the current economic conditions in the United States and Europe is likely to unfavorably impact Goodyears sales and earnings in future periods. Similarly, continued volatile economic conditions in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods. Goodyear may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including war, acts of terror and civil obstructions. Critical Accounting Policies, Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of intangibles and other long lived assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, warranty, workers compensation, litigation, general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, and various other operating allowances and accruals, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. Goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling $491.7 million at December 31, 2003 and $240.7 million (as restated) at December 31, 2002 for potential product liability and other tort claims, including related legal fees expected to be incurred. Of these amounts, $142.5 million and $75.4 million (as restated) were included in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The amounts recorded were estimated on the basis of an assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and, where available, recent and current trends. The Company had recorded insurance receivables for potential product liability and other tort claims of $199.3 million at December 31, 2003 and $81.0 million at December 31, 2002. Of this amount, $100.1 million and $24.7 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts and notes receivable at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Asbestos. Goodyear is a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft 35 Table of Contents braking systems manufactured by Goodyear in the past or to asbestos in certain Goodyear facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in state and Federal courts. In connection with the preparation of its 2003 financial statements, the Company engaged an independent asbestos valuation expert to assist the Company in reviewing its reserves for asbestos claims, and review the Companys method of determining its receivables from probable insurance recoveries. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, the Companys estimate for asbestos liability was based upon a review of the various characteristics of the pending claims by an experienced asbestos counsel. The Company, based on the advice of the valuation expert, has recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims at December 31, 2003 totaling $131.1 million, inclusive of defense costs. The recorded liability represents the Companys estimated liability through 2008, which represents the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future could result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot currently be reasonably estimated, and that increase could be significant. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims at December 31, 2003 is $31.9 million. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company did not have an accrual for unasserted claims as sufficient information was deemed to be not available to reliably estimate such an obligation. This conclusion was further confirmed by the valuation expert during the preparation of the 2003 financial statements. At December 31, 2003, the Companys liability with respect to asserted claims and related defense costs was $99.2 million compared to $139.2 million at December 31, 2002, notwithstanding an increase in the number of pending claims between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003. The reduction in the amount recorded at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 is due to refinements in certain assumptions used by the valuation expert. After reviewing the Companys recent settlement history by jurisdiction, law firm, disease type and alleged date of first exposure, the valuation expert cited two primary reasons for the Company to refine its valuation assumptions. First, in calculating the Companys estimated liability, the valuation expert determined that the Company had previously assumed that it would resolve more claims in the foreseeable future than is likely based on its historical record and nationwide trends. As a result, the Company now assumes that a smaller percentage of pending claims will be resolved within the predictable future. Second, the valuation expert determined that it was not possible to estimate a liability for as many non malignancy claims as the Company had done in the past. As a result, the Companys current estimated liability includes fewer liabilities associated with non malignancy claims. Goodyear maintains primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. Goodyear records a receivable with respect to such policies when it determines that recovery is probable and it can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. Prior to 2003, Goodyear did not record a receivable for expected recoveries from excess carriers in respect of asbestos related matters. Goodyear has instituted coverage actions against certain of these excess carriers. After consultation with its outside legal counsel and giving consideration to relevant factors including the ongoing legal proceedings with certain of its excess coverage insurance carriers, their financial viability, their legal obligations and other pertinent facts, Goodyear determined an amount it expects is probable of recovery from such carriers. Accordingly, Goodyear recorded a receivable during 2003, which represents an estimate of recovery from its excess coverage insurance carriers relating to potential asbestos related liabilities. The valuation expert also reviewed the Companys method of valuing its receivables recorded for probable insurance recoveries. Based upon the model employed by the valuation expert, as of December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $110.4 million. Based on the Companys current asbestos claim profile, the Company expects that approximately 85% of asbestos claim related losses will be recoverable up to its accessible policy limits. The receivable recorded consists of an amount the Company expects to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount it believes is probable of recovery from certain of its excess coverage insurance carriers. Of this amount, $20.4 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts and notes receivable at 36 Table of Contents December 31, 2003. Goodyear had recorded insurance receivables of $69.7 million at December 31, 2002. Of this amount, $20.0 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts and notes receivable. Goodyear believes that its reserve for asbestos claims, and the insurance assets recorded in respect of these claims, reflect reasonable and probable estimates of these amounts, subject to the exclusion of claims for which it is not feasible to make reasonable estimates. The estimate of the assets and liabilities related to pending and expected future asbestos claims and insurance recoveries is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changes in (i) the litigation environment; (ii) federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; (iii) the Companys approach to defending and resolving claims; and (iv) the level of payments made to claimants from other sources, including other defendants. As a result, with respect to both asserted and unasserted claims, it is reasonably possible that the Company may incur a material amount in excess of the current reserve, however such amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Heatway (Entran II). The Company is a defendant in 22 class actions or potential class actions and four other civil actions in various Federal, state and Canadian courts asserting non asbestos property damage claims relating to Entran II, a rubber hose product that it supplied from 1989 1993 to Chiles Power Supply, Inc. (d/b/a Heatway Systems), a designer and seller of hydronic radiant heating systems in the United States. The plaintiffs in these actions are generally seeking recovery under various tort, contract and statutory causes of action, including breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, negligence, strict liability and violation of state consumer protection statutes. In one of the above mentioned class actions, on October 9, 2003, the United States District Court for District Court of New Jersey preliminarily approved a proposed national settlement agreement (the Proposed Settlement) for pending Entran II claims in the U.S. and Canada, except for claims related to property in six New England states, two judgments in Colorado state court, two judgments in Colorado Federal court, and any future judgments involving claimants that opt out of the Proposed Settlement. Claimants had until May 7, 2004, to opt out of the Proposed Settlement. The Company has the right to withdraw from the Proposed Settlement if it determines in good faith and in its sole discretion that an excessive number of persons have opted out of the class and the Proposed Settlement. As of May 17, 2004, the Company had received notice that at least 525 potential sites had been opted out of the Proposed Settlement. The Company is currently assessing its options with respect to the Proposed Settlement and expects to decide shortly whether or not to withdraw from the Proposed Settlement. The ultimate cost of disposing of Entran II claims is dependent upon a number of factors, including the Companys ability to satisfy the contingencies in any settlement, the number of claimants that opt out of any settlement, final approval of the terms of any settlement. Goodyears ability to resolve claims not subject to any settlement (including the cases in which the Company received adverse judgments), and, in the event Goodyear fails to consummate a settlement for any reason, future judgments by courts in other currently pending or yet unasserted actions. Depending on the resolution of these uncertainties, the costs associated with Entran II claims could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position and liquidity in future periods. Due to the uncertainties inherent in Entran II matters, it is reasonably possible that there exists material liability beyond what Goodyear has already reserved for, but such amounts cannot be reasonably estimated. Other Actions. The Company is currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings in addition to those noted above. If management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range, and no point within the range is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Based on currently available information, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting the Company from selling one or more products. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the financial position and results of operations of the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. 37 Table of Contents Environmental Matters. Goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling $32.8 million at December 31, 2003 and $53.5 million at December 31, 2002 for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters, primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by Goodyear. Of these amounts, $7.7 million and $21.4 million were included in Other current liabilities at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The costs include legal and consulting fees, site studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post remediation monitoring and related activities and will be paid over several years. The amount of Goodyears ultimate liability in respect of these matters may be affected by several uncertainties, primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation and the extent to which other responsible parties contribute. The liability was reduced in 2003 by approximately $17 million due to the resolution related to one site during the year. Workers Compensation. Goodyear had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, totaling $194.0 million and $152.4 million (as restated) for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Of these amounts, $112.7 million and $66.4 million (as restated) were included in Current Liabilities as part of Compensation and benefits at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on Goodyears assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of Goodyears ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. Goodwill. In January 2002, Goodyear adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under this standard, Goodyear no longer amortizes goodwill, but tests it annually for impairment because it is an asset with an indefinite useful life. However, the occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, would result in Goodyears having to perform the impairment analysis more frequently than on an annual basis. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. The Company determined estimated fair values of the reporting units using a valuation methodology based largely on comparable company analysis. Under this method, the Company used an EBITDA multiple representative of the global automotive industry sector to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit. The EBITDA multiple was adjusted to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions. The EBITDA of the reporting units was adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. At December 31, 2003, Goodyear had valuation allowances aggregating $2.00 billion against all of its net Federal and state and some of its international subsidiaries deferred tax assets. The net Federal and state deferred tax assets are almost entirely composed of deductions available to reduce Federal and state taxable income in future years. The international deferred tax assets include loss carryforwards as well as deductions available to reduce future international taxable income. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. In accordance with SFAS 109, evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability which are inherently uncertain. Goodyears U.S. losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net Federal and state deferred tax assets under SFAS 109. Goodyear intends to maintain a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the Federal and state deferred tax assets. Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. Goodyears recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions, including future health care costs, maximum 38 Table of Contents company covered benefit costs, life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets and future compensation levels. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries. Assumptions about health care costs, life expectancies, retirement rates and future compensation levels are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. Discount rates are based on market indicators at the time these assumptions are established. These assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate, and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of Goodyears recorded expenses for these benefits. If the actual experience differs from expectations, Goodyears financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate projected benefit obligation for Goodyears pension plans was $6.88 billion. A 25 basis point change in the U.S. discount rate would impact pension expense in 2004 by approximately $8 million. As of December 31, 2003, Goodyears accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $3.08 billion. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate for its main U.S. plans would impact 2004 postretirement benefit expense by approximately $2 million. Goodyears U.S. pension asset returns were 23.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The unfunded amount of Goodyears projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2003 was $2.75 billion, compared to $2.46 billion (as restated) at December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Goodyear recorded a $128 million benefit to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for unfunded pension benefit obligations, compared to a $1.28 billion charge for the year ended December 31, 2002. If market conditions deteriorate, charges could increase in future periods. Although subject to change, based on current estimates, Goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately $160 million in 2004, and approximately $325 million to $350 million in 2005 to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements. Goodyear will be subject to additional statutory minimum funding requirements after 2005. The amount of funding requirements could be substantial and will be based on a number of factors, including the value of the pension assets at the time as well as the interest rate for the relevant period. SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects the strategic business units of Goodyear, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. The Tire business is managed on a regional basis. Engineered Products and Chemical Products are managed on a global basis. Results of operations in the Tire and Engineered Products Segments were measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Results of operations of the Chemical Products Segment were measured based on net sales (including sales to other SBUs) and segment operating income. Segment operating income included transfers to other SBUs. Segment operating income was computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding accelerated depreciation charges, asset impairment charges and asset writeoffs) and SAG (excluding corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also included equity (earnings) losses in affiliates. Segment operating income did not include the previously discussed rationalization charges and certain other items. Total segment operating income was $516.0 million in 2003, $416.7 million (as restated) in 2002 and $321.1 million (as restated) in 2001. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2003 was 3.3%, compared to 2.9% (as restated) in 2002 and 2.2% (as restated) in 2001. Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by the Companys SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income as measured in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Refer to the note to the financial statements No. 18, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income (loss) before income taxes. 39 Table of Contents North American Tire Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Tire Units 101.2 103.9 112.0 Sales $ 6,745.6 $ 6,703.0 $ 7,170.2 Segment Operating Income (Loss) (128.7 ) (57.1 ) 100.9 Segment Operating Margin (1.9 )% (0.9 )% 1.4 % North American Tire Segment unit sales in 2003 decreased 2.7 million units or 2.5% from 2002 and 10.8 million units or 9.6% from 2001. Replacement unit sales in 2003 decreased 1.2 million units or 1.5% from 2002 and 11.1 million units or 13.9% from 2001. Original equipment volume in 2003 decreased 1.5 million units or 4.5% from 2002 and increased 0.3 million units or 0.7% from 2001. Revenues in 2003 increased 0.6% from 2002 and decreased 5.9% from 2001. Net sales increased in 2003 due to improved pricing and product mix of approximately $118 million, primarily in the consumer replacement and original equipment markets, and lower product related adjustments of approximately $10 million. The production slowdown by automakers and a decrease in the consumer replacement custom brand channel contributed to lower volume of approximately $86 million in 2003. Revenues (as restated) in 2002 decreased 6.5% from 2001. Sales in 2002 decreased compared to 2001 due to reduced volume of approximately $435 million, primarily in certain segments of the replacement market and the lower tire units delivered in connection with the Ford tire replacement program initiated in 2001, partially offset by increased sales to original equipment manufacturers in 2002 as automakers increased production. Unfavorable product mix in consumer and commercial replacement of approximately $27 million also negatively impacted sales compared to 2001. During 2002, Goodyear supplied approximately 500 thousand tire units with a segment operating income benefit of approximately $10 million in connection with the Ford tire replacement program. Ford ended the replacement program on March 31, 2002. During 2001, Goodyear supplied approximately 5 million tire units with a segment operating income benefit of approximately $95 million in connection with the Ford replacement program. North American Tire segment operating income in 2003 decreased significantly from 2002 and 2001. Higher raw materials costs of approximately $151 million, higher manufacturing conversion costs of approximately $86 million, primarily related to contractual increases, and lower consumer volume of approximately $12 million adversely impacted 2003 segment operating income. Segment operating income benefited by approximately $66 million in savings related to rationalization programs and by approximately $37 million due to lower research and development expenditures. One time benefits of approximately $51 million due to the change in the salaried associates vacation policy discussed above and insurance recoveries related to general and product liabilities of approximately $20 million also positively impacted 2003 segment operating income. North American Tire segment operating income (as restated) decreased substantially in 2002 from 2001 due to lower tonnage and higher plant compensation costs and operating expenses of approximately $161 million (as restated). Segment operating income was also negatively impacted by lower replacement sales volume, including the Ford program, of approximately $74 million (as restated). Product mix, primarily replacement consumer and commercial, unfavorably impacted segment operating income by approximately $122 million (as restated) as did the impact of the $10 million charge related to the closure of Penske Automotive Centers. Segment operating income in 2002 was favorably impacted by a decrease in raw material costs of approximately $120 million and lower transportation costs of approximately $30 million. Lower SAG expenses, due primarily to reduced advertising and information technology expenses, of approximately $20 million (as restated) and savings from rationalization programs of approximately $13 million also benefited 2002 segment operating income. In addition, 2001 included a charge of $30 million for a proactive tire replacement program covering certain tires in service on 15 passenger vans and ambulances. 40 Table of Contents Segment operating income in 2001 included expenses related to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives totaling $3.5 million. In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ceased at January 1, 2002. Segment operating income did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $191.9 million in 2003, $(1.9) million in 2002 and $31.6 million in 2001. Segment operating income also did not include the loss on asset sales of $3.8 million in 2003 and the writeoff of a miscellaneous investment totaling $4.1 million in 2002. Revenues and segment operating income in the North American Tire Segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, reduced demand in the replacement market, changes in product mix, continued increases in raw material and energy prices, higher wage and benefit costs and general economic conditions.

Partially offsetting these improvements were higher raw material costs of approximately $50 million, the negative impact of currency translation of approximately $20 million, mainly Brazil and Venezuela, higher conversion costs related to utilities of approximately $12 million and increased SAG costs of approximately $11 million, mainly blimp related expenses, increased reserve for doubtful accounts and increased wages and benefits due to inflationary cost increases. Latin American Tire segment operating income (as restated) in 2002 increased 25.7% from 2001. Segment operating income in 2002 was favorably impacted by approximately $45 million related to pricing and product mix, approximately $20 million related to lower raw material costs and higher sales volume, primarily in the replacement market, of approximately $4 million. Segment operating income in 2002 was adversely impacted by the effects of currency translation of approximately $46 million, mainly in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, and increased SAG expenses of approximately $3 million due to higher wages and benefits largely due to inflationary cost increases. Segment operating income in 2001 included expenses related to the amortization of goodwill totaling $0.1 million. In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill ceased at January 1, 2002. 43 Table of Contents Segment operating income did not include net rationalization charges totaling $10.0 million and the gain from asset sales of $2.0 million in 2003, the gain from the sale of land and buildings in Mexico totaling $13.7 million in 2002 and rationalization charges totaling $0.2 million in 2001. Revenues and segment operating income in the Latin American Tire Segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, changes in mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, continued volatile economic and government conditions, future adverse economic conditions in the region and currency translation.

Replacement unit sales in 2003 decreased 0.1 million units or 1.0% from 2002 and increased 0.3 million units or 2.6% from 2001. Original equipment volume in 2003 increased 0.7 million units or 18.9% from 2002 and 1.0 million units or 31.3% from 2001. Revenue in 2003 increased 9.5% from 2002 and 17.6% from 2001. Net sales increased in 2003 due to increased volume of approximately $29 million primarily a result of strong original equipment demand. Favorable currency translation, largely in India and Australia, of approximately $16 million also improved net sales. Revenues (as restated) in 2002 increased 7.4% from 2001. Revenues in 2002 increased compared to 2001 due primarily to higher original equipment and replacement volumes of approximately $26 million and improved selling prices on replacement consumer and commercial tires of approximately $9 million. The effects of currency translation also had a favorable impact on sales of approximately $2 million in 2002. Asia Tire segment operating income in 2003 increased 14.0% from 2002 and substantially from 2001. Segment operating income in 2003 increased primarily due to improvements in consumer and farm product mix and higher selling prices in both replacement and original equipment markets of approximately $14 million, favorable currency translation of approximately $8 million, and increased volume of approximately $7 million due to strong original equipment demand. Segment operating income in 2003 was favorably impacted by approximately $3 million due to increased sales of miscellaneous products and improved equity income. Higher raw material costs of approximately $27 million negatively impacted 2003 segment operating income. Segment operating income (as restated) in 2002 increased substantially from 2001. Segment operating income in 2002 increased compared to 2001 due to lower raw material costs of approximately $8 million, improved replacement consumer and commercial pricing and product mix of approximately $7 million, higher original equipment and replacement volume of approximately $4 million and lower conversion costs as a result of cost containment programs of approximately $3 million (as restated). Segment operating income in 2002 improved due to the favorable effects of currency translation of approximately $2 million and savings from rationalization actions of approximately $3 million. Segment operating income in 2002 was adversely affected by higher SAG expenses of approximately $5 million. Segment operating income in 2001 included expenses related to the amortization of goodwill totaling $1.7 million (as restated). In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill ceased at January 1, 2002. Segment operating income did not include the gain from asset sales of $2.1 million in 2003, rationalization charges (credits) totaling $(1.7) million in 2002 and $47.0 million (as restated) in 2001. 44 Table of Contents Revenues and segment operating income in the Asia Tire Segment may be adversely affected in future periods by the effects of continued competitive pricing conditions, changes in mix, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy costs and currency translation. In addition, Goodyear owns a 50% interest in SPT, the largest tire manufacturer, marketer and exporter in Australia and New Zealand. Results of operations of SPT are not reported in segment results, and are reflected in Goodyears Consolidated Statement of Operations using the equity method. The following presents 100% of the sales and operating income of SPT: Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Net Sales $ 642.0 $ 523.6 $ 481.3 Operating Income (Loss) 9.9 (7.1 ) (22.2 ) SPT net sales in 2003 increased 22.6% from 2002 and 33.4% from 2001. SPT net sales in 2003 increased from 2002 primarily due to higher sales volume and the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. SPT net sales in 2002 increased from 2001 due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. SPT operating income in 2003 increased substantially from 2002 and 2001. SPT operating income in 2003 increased from 2002 and in 2002 from 2001 due to the benefits of the rationalization programs in the prior years. SPT operating income did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $4.9 million in 2003, $(2.1) million in 2002 and $48.0 million in 2001. SPT debt totaled $196.9 million at December 31, 2003, of which $72.0 million was payable to Goodyear. SPT debt totaled $131.3 million at December 31, 2002, of which $26.3 million was payable to Goodyear.

Revenues in 2003 increased from 2002 due to the favorable impact of currency translation of approximately $39 million, mainly in Canada, South Africa and Europe, and improved volume of approximately $30 million as a result of increased military sales. Improved pricing and product mix, mainly industrial, of approximately $8 million also positively impacted 2003 revenues. Revenues in 2002 increased from 2001 due largely to increased volume of approximately $36 million, mainly military and custom products. Partially offsetting this variance compared to 2001 is the unfavorable effects of currency translation of approximately $24 million, mainly in Brazil, and unfavorable product mix of approximately $8 million. Engineered Products segment operating income in 2003 increased from 2002 and 2001. Segment operating income in 2003 increased 16.1% from 2002 due to volume increases of approximately $7 million related to military sales, lower raw material costs of approximately $5 million, and favorable effects of currency translation of approximately $5 million. The change in salaried vacation policy described above also favorably impacted 2003 segment operating income by approximately $8 million. Segment operating income was adversely impacted by unfavorable price/mix of approximately $11 million due to increased sales of original equipment and heavy duty product and higher SAG costs, excluding the impact of the vacation policy change, of approximately $9 million, primarily related to increased sales efforts. 45 Table of Contents Segment operating income (as restated) in 2002 increased significantly from 2001 due to improved productivity of approximately $13 million (as restated), volume increases of approximately $12 million and decreased SAG expenses of approximately $12 million (as restated) primarily due to aggressive cost containment measures. Segment operating income in 2002 was adversely impacted by an unfavorable change in price/mix of approximately $5 million and the effects of currency translation of approximately $3 million. Segment operating income in 2001 included expenses related to amortization of goodwill totaling $1.0 million. In accordance with SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill ceased at January 1, 2002. Segment operating income did not include a loss from the sale of assets totaling $6.3 million and rationalization charges of $29.4 million in 2003, a gain from the sale of land and buildings totaling $0.6 million and net rationalization charges of $4.6 million in 2002 and net rationalization charges of $1.5 million in 2001. In conjunction with the restatement, certain adjustments related to Engineered Products were recorded. It was not possible to allocate the amount of this adjustment to applicable periods and accordingly, Goodyear recorded substantially all of this adjustment in the first quarter of 2003. This account reconciliation adjustment includes the write off of $21.3 million consisting of $3.7 million in intercompany accounts and $17.6 million related to payables and other accounts. Segment operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $19 million in 2003 due to these adjustments. Several factors relating to the Companys ERP systems implementation resulted in EPDs inability to locate or recreate account reconciliations for prior periods. Revenues and segment operating income in the Engineered Products Segment may be adversely affected in future periods by lower original equipment demand, competitive pricing pressures, expected continuing unfavorable economic conditions in certain markets, adverse economic conditions globally in the mining, construction and agriculture industries, unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices, anticipated higher wage and benefit costs and currency translation. Chemical Products Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Sales $ 1,220.8 $ 940.2 $ 1,036.5 Segment Operating Income 119.4 88.7 41.9 Segment Operating Margin 9.8 % 9.4 % 4.0 % Chemical Products Segment sales in 2003 increased 29.8% from 2002 and 17.8% from 2001. Approximately 63% of the total pounds of synthetic materials sold by the Chemical Products segment in 2003 were to Goodyears other segments. Natural rubber plantations, a rubber processing facility and natural rubber purchasing operations are included in the Chemical Products Segment. Revenues in 2003 increased from 2002 largely due to higher net selling prices resulting from the pass through of increased raw material and energy costs of approximately $145 million and increases in synthetic rubber volume of approximately $42 million. Also favorably impacting 2003 revenues were higher pricing and volume from the natural rubber operations of approximately $76 million and the relatively strong Euro of approximately $18 million. Revenues (as restated) in 2002 decreased from 2001 primarily due to the impact of selling the Specialty Chemical Business in December 2001, which contributed approximately $127 million of revenue in 2001. Revenues in 2002 were also unfavorably impacted approximately $33 million by lower net selling prices, which were caused by decreased raw material costs. 2002 revenues were favorably impacted approximately $37 million due to increased revenue for natural rubber operations, approximately $20 million due to increased synthetic volume, and approximately $6 million in favorable currency translation largely a result of the strong Euro. Chemical Products segment operating income in 2003 increased significantly from 2002 and 2001. Segment operating income increased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to higher net selling prices of approximately $145 million, currency translation of approximately $18 million and improved pricing and 46 Table of Contents volume for natural rubber operations of approximately $16 million. Increased raw material costs of approximately $127 million and increased conversion costs of approximately $22 million unfavorably impacted 2003 segment operating income. The Specialty Chemical Business was sold in December 2001. Segment operating income (as restated) in 2002 increased substantially from 2001 despite the absence of approximately $12 million contributed by the Specialty Chemical Business in 2001. Segment operating income in 2002 increased primarily due to lower raw material costs of approximately $46 million and lower conversion costs of approximately $33 million (as restated) partially offset by lower net selling prices of approximately $33 million. Segment operating income did not include gains on asset sales of $27.4 million in 2001. The Company is exploring the possible sale of its Chemical business, or portions thereof, to both enhance its financial flexibility and focus future investments on its core business. Revenues and segment operating income in the Chemical Products Segment may be adversely affected in future periods by competitive pricing pressures, lower aggregate demand levels for its products and unanticipated increases in raw material and energy prices. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2003, the Company had $1.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents as well as $335.0 million of unused availability under its various credit agreements. Based upon the Companys projected operating results, the Company expects that cash flow from operations together with available borrowing under its restructured credit facilities and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet the Companys anticipated cash and cash equivalent requirements including working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through December 31, 2004. However, several contingencies could affect the Companys ability to meet its future obligations, including (i) the failure to successfully implement its turnaround strategy for the North American Tire Segment and restore the segment to profitability; (ii) a significant adverse ruling or development in the Companys legal proceedings, especially with respect to the Companys Entran II litigation; (iii) a further increase in our interest expense from an unexpected and significant increase in interest rates; and (iv) the failure to refinance certain of our credit facilities maturing in 2005 and 2006. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $306.7 million during 2003, as reported on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Working capital increased $2.07 billion to $3.30 billion at December 31, 2003, from $1.23 billion (as restated) at December 31, 2002, due primarily to increased cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The increased accounts receivable is due primarily to the termination of Goodyears domestic accounts receivable securitization program effective April 1, 2003. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements, No. 5, Accounts and Notes Receivable. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $236.0 million during 2003. Capital expenditures in 2003 were $375.4 million, of which $221.2 million was used on projects to increase capacity and improve productivity and $154.2 million was used for tire molds and various other projects. Capital expenditures have been reduced in response to current economic and business conditions. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $488 million in 2004, including approximately $294 million for manufacturing improvements and approximately $194 million for molds and various other projects. Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Capital expenditures $ 375.4 $ 458.1 $ 435.5 Depreciation 686.4 600.4 597.7 Amortization 6.9 4.3 40.4 47 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization in 2003 included approximately $78 million of accelerated depreciation charges related to the 2003 Huntsville and Wolverhampton restructuring plans. Depreciation and amortization in 2001 included $29.1 million (as restated) of amortization related to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are no longer amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. Investing activities in 2003 included net proceeds from the sale of assets in the United States of $85.8 million, in Latin America of $2.0 million, in Asia of $2.1 million and in Europe of $14.5 million. Included in the United States total of $85.8 million is $82.9 million for the sale of 20.8 million shares of Goodyears investment in SRI. Goodyear also purchased Arkansas Best Corporations 19% ownership interest in Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC (Wingfoot) for $71.2 million. Wingfoot was a joint venture company formed by Goodyear and Arkansas Best Corporation to sell and service commercial truck tires, provide retread services and conduct related business. Goodyear now owns 100% of Wingfoot. At December 31, 2003, Goodyear had binding commitments for raw materials and investments in land, buildings and equipment of $520.1 million and off balance sheet financial guarantees written and other commitments totaling $74.4 million. For further information on investing activities, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 8, Investments. Financing Activities Net cash from financing activities was $1,125.3 million during 2003. December 31, Restated 2003 2002 2001 (In millions) Consolidated Debt $ 5,077.4 $ 3,643.0 $ 3,568.3 Debt to Debt and Equity 100.3 % 93.4 % 57.6 % Certain of Goodyears affiliates are restricted from remitting funds to the parent company by means of dividends, advances or loans, primarily due to credit facility restrictions currently in place in those locations. At December 31, 2003, approximately $259 million of net assets were restricted. Credit Sources Restructuring and Refinancing of Credit Facilities On April 1, 2003, the Company completed a comprehensive restructuring and refinancing of its bank credit and receivables securitization facilities which replaced a total of $2,938 million in finance facilities with a total of $3,345 million of the following finance facilities: $750 million Senior Secured U.S. Revolving Credit Facility due April 2005; $645 million Senior Secured U.S. Term Facility due April 2005; $650 million Senior Secured European Facilities due April 2005; and $1.30 billion Senior Secured Asset Backed Facilities due March 2006. With the exception of approximately $700 million in domestic accounts receivable securitizations and $63 million in Canadian accounts receivable securitizations, each of the replaced finance facilities was unsecured. The accounts receivable and debt that are subject to the new $1.30 billion asset backed facilities are included on Goodyears consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Accounts receivable subject to the terminated $763 million domestic and Canadian accounts receivable programs were not included on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002 due to the securitization programs which resulted in off balance sheet treatment. 48 Table of Contents At December 31, 2003, the Company had $125.6 million of committed credit available under the facilities described above. In aggregate, the Company had committed and uncommitted credit facilities of $5.90 billion available at December 31, 2003, of which $335.0 million were unused. Recent Financing Activities Subsequent to the fiscal year end, on February 23, 2004, we completed the addition of a $650 million tranche to our $1.30 billion Senior Secured Asset Backed Facility. Approximately $335 million of the proceeds of the tranche were used to partially reduce amounts outstanding under the U.S. term facility discussed below. On March 12, 2004, we completed a private offering of $650 million in senior secured notes, consisting of $450 million of 11% senior secured notes due 2011 and $200 million of floating rate notes at LIBOR plus 8%. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay the remaining outstanding amount under the U.S. term facility, to permanently reduce our commitment under the U.S. revolving credit facility by $70 million, and for general corporate purposes. In connection with these financing activities, each of the above restructured credit facilities was amended on February 19, 2004. The Companys credit agreements were further amended on April 16, 2004, to extend until May 19, 2004, the deadline for filing the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and on May 18, 2004, to extend until June 4, 2004, the deadline for providing audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 of Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. to lenders. $645 Million Senior Secured U.S. Term Facility As of December 31, 2003, the balance due on the U.S. term facility was $583.3 million due to a partial pay down of the balance during the second quarter. The U.S. term facility was originally scheduled to mature on April 30, 2005. In connection with our recent financing activities discussed above, on March 12, 2004, all outstanding amounts under the facility were prepaid and the facility was retired. $750 Million Senior Secured U.S. Revolving Credit Facility The Companys $750 million revolving credit facility matures on April 30, 2005. Up to $600 million of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Under the facility, as of December 31, 2003, there were borrowings of $200.0 million and $485.4 million in letters of credit issued. The Company pays an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitment under the U.S. revolving credit facility. On March 12, 2004, in connection with our recent financing activities, our commitment under this facility was permanently reduced to $680 million. We may obtain loans under the U.S. revolving credit facility bearing interest at LIBOR plus 400 basis points or an alternative base rate (the higher of JPMorgans prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points) plus 300 basis points. The U.S. revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness (including a limit of 275 million Euros in accounts receivable transactions), make investments, and sell assets beyond specified limits. The facility prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock. We must also maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (as such term is defined in the U.S. facility) of at least $2.80 billion and $2.50 billion for quarters ending in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and $2.00 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2005. The facilities have customary representations, warranties and covenants including, as a condition of borrowing, material adverse change representations in the Companys financial condition since December 31, 2002. In addition, under the facilities, Goodyear was not permitted to fall below a ratio of 2.25 to 1.00 of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as such terms are defined in each of the restructured credit facilities) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. On February 19, 2004, in connection with an amendment to the credit facilities, the ratio was reduced to 2.00 to 1.00. In addition, Goodyears ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in each of the restructured credit facilities) is not permitted to be greater than 4.00 to 1.00 at any time. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit facilities. 49 Table of Contents Consolidated EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure of the Companys ability to service debt. It should not be construed as an alternative to either (i) income from operations or (ii) cash flows from operating activities. The Companys failure to comply with the financial covenants in the restructured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on Goodyears liquidity and operations. Accordingly, management believes that the presentation of consolidated EBITDA will provide investors with information needed to assess the Companys ability to continue to comply with these covenants. The following table presents the calculation of EBITDA and Consolidated EBITDA for 2003. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than Goodyear does. Certain line items are presented as defined in the restructured credit facilities, and do not reflect amounts as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 2003 (In millions) Net Loss $ (802.1 ) Consolidated Interest Expense 314.6 Income Tax 112.2 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 693.3 EBITDA 318.0 Credit Agreement Adjustments: Other (Income) and Expense 284.5 Foreign Currency Exchange 40.2 Equity in (Earnings) Losses of Affiliates 12.1 Minority Interest in Net Income (Loss) of Subsidiaries 35.0 Non cash Extraordinary Gains Non cash Non recurring Items 54.7 Rationalizations 291.5 Less Excess Cash Rationalization Charges (12.9 ) Consolidated EBITDA $ 1,023.1 The U.S. facilities also limit the amount of capital expenditures the Company may make to $360 million, $500 million, and $500 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005 ($200 million through April 30, 2005), respectively. The amounts of permitted capital expenditures may be increased by the amount of net proceeds retained by the Company from permitted asset sales and equity and debt issuances after application of the prepayment requirement in the U.S. term facility described above. As a result of certain activities, the capital expenditure limit for 2003 was increased from $360 million to approximately $381 million. In addition, to the extent the Company does not reach the limit of permitted capital expenditures in any given year, such shortfall may be carried over into the next year. The capital expenditure limit for 2004 has increased approximately $270 million as a result of capital market transactions completed during the first quarter of 2004 and carryovers from 2003. $650 Million Senior Secured European Facilities Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (GDTE) is party to a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $400 million senior secured term loan facility. These facilities mature on April 30, 2005. As of December 31, 2003, there were borrowings of $250.0 million and $400.0 million under the European revolving and term facilities, respectively. GDTE pays an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the European revolving facility. GDTE may obtain loans under the European facilities bearing interest 50 Table of Contents at LIBOR plus 400 basis points or an alternative base rate (the higher of JPMorgans prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points) plus 300 basis points. Consistent with the covenants applicable to Goodyear in the U.S. facilities, the European facilities contain certain covenants applicable to GDTE and its subsidiaries which, among other things, limit GDTEs ability to incur additional indebtedness (including a limit of 275 million Euros in accounts receivable transactions), make investments, sell assets beyond specified limits, pay dividends and make loans or advances to Goodyear companies that are not subsidiaries of GDTE. The European facilities also contain certain representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company identical to those in the U.S. facilities. The European facilities also limit the amount of capital expenditures that GDTE may make to $180 million, $250 million and $100 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005 (through April 30), respectively. Subject to the provisions in the European facilities and agreements with Goodyears joint venture partner, SRI (which include limitations on loans and advances from GDTE to Goodyear and a requirement that transactions with affiliates be consistent with past practices or on arms length terms), GDTE is permitted to transfer funds to Goodyear. $1.30 Billion Senior Secured Asset Backed Credit Facilities The Company has also entered into senior secured asset backed credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.30 billion, consisting of a $500 million revolving credit facility and an $800 million term loan facility. As of December 31, 2003, there were borrowings of $389.0 million and $800.0 million under the revolving credit and term loan asset backed facilities, respectively. The facilities mature on March 31, 2006 and contain certain representations, warranties and covenants which are materially the same as those in the U.S. facility, with capital expenditures of $500 million and $150 million permitted in 2005 and 2006 (through March 31), respectively. Goodyear must also maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (as such term is defined in the U.S. facilities) of at least $2.80 billion and $2.50 billion for quarters ending in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and $2.00 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2005. On February 20, 2004, the Company added a $650 million tranche to the existing $1.30 billion facility. Foreign Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2003, Goodyear had short term committed and uncommitted bank credit arrangements totaling $347.0 million, of which $209.3 million were unused. The continued availability of these arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender, and a portion of these arrangements may be terminated at any time. Non Domestic Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities Various international subsidiaries of the Company have also established accounts receivable continuous sales programs whereunder these subsidiaries may receive proceeds from the sale of certain of their receivables. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. As of December 31, 2003, international subsidiaries of Goodyear had $122.8 million of available borrowings under non domestic accounts receivable securitization facilities. As of December 31, 2003, the amount outstanding and fully utilized under the program maintained by GDTE totaled $104.2 million. The Company is currently working to refinance this facility and the commitment period has been extended to September 2004. If the Company is unable to replace this facility, the Company would pursue short term financing alternatives. In addition to the $104.2 million of GDTE receivable programs, the Company had an additional $18.6 million outstanding under other non domestic receivable financing programs. At December 31, 2003, the net proceeds for all sales of receivables by Goodyear were $122.8 million. Net cash outflows of $831.8 million were recorded in 2003 for transfers of accounts receivable under these and other programs. For further information, refer to the note to the financial statements No. 5, Accounts and Notes Receivable. 51 Table of Contents Credit Ratings The current credit ratings for the Company are presented below: S&P Moodys Senior Secured Asset Backed Facilities BB+ B1 U.S./European Facilities B+/BB B1/B1 $650 million Asset backed Tranche B+ B2 $650 million Senior Secured Notes due 2011 * B3 Corporate Rating BB B1 (implied) Senior Unsecured Debt B B3 * Private Rating While Goodyear does not request ratings from Fitch, the rating agency rates the Companys secured facilities B and the Companys unsecured debt CCC+. Moodys currently maintains a negative outlook for the Company, while S&P has placed us on credit watch. Unless the Companys debt credit ratings and operating performance improve, its access to the credit markets in the future may be limited. Moreover, a further reduction in the Companys credit ratings would further increase the cost of any financing initiatives the Company may pursue. As a result of these ratings and other related events, the Company believes that its access to capital markets may be limited. In addition, financing and related expenses under some existing arrangements have increased as a result of the Companys non investment grade ratings. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency, and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Turnaround Strategy The Company is currently implementing a turnaround strategy for the North American Tire Segment that will require the Company to 1) stabilize margins and market shares, 2) simplify the sales and supply chain process, 3) execute key cost cutting, brand and distribution strategies and 4) grow the business through new product introductions and new sales channels. The ability of the Company to successfully implement its cost cutting strategy is also dependent upon its ability to realize anticipated savings and operational benefits from its recently ratified new master contract with the USWA. There is no assurance that the Company will successfully implement this turnaround strategy. In particular, this strategy and the Companys liquidity could be affected adversely by trends that affected the North American Tire Segment negatively in 2003 and prior years, including industry overcapacity which limits pricing leverage, weakness in the replacement tire market, increased competition from low cost manufacturers and a related decline in Goodyears market share, weak U.S. economic conditions, and increases in medical and pension costs. In addition, the turnaround strategy has been, and may continue to be, impacted negatively by higher than expected raw materials and energy prices. The price of natural rubber, one of our most important raw materials, increased approximately 36% in 2003 and is expected to increase in 2004. In addition, the price of oil, an important feedstock for several other raw materials, increased approximately 25% in 2003. Our turnaround plan could continue to be impacted by higher raw material costs. Furthermore, market conditions may prevent us from passing these increases on to our customers through timely price increases. Future Liquidity Requirements As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $1.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $612.7 million was held in the United States and $432.8 million was in accounts of GDTE. The remaining amounts were held in the Companys other non U.S. operations. The Companys ability to move cash and cash equivalents among its various operating locations is subject to the operating needs of the operating 52 Table of Contents locations as well as restrictions imposed by local laws and applicable credit facility agreements. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $215 million of cash was held in locations where significant tax or legal impediments would make it difficult or costly to execute monetary transfers. Based upon the Companys projected operating results, the Company expects that cash flow from operations together with available borrowing under its restructured credit facilities and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet the Companys anticipated cash and cash equivalent requirements including working capital, debt service and capital expenditures through December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company also had $335.0 million of unused availability under its various credit agreements. The Companys restructured and refinanced credit facilities mature in 2005 and 2006 and the Company would have to refinance these facilities in the capital markets if they were not renewed by the banks. After taking into account the paydown of certain obligations in connection with recent financing activities, the aggregate amount of long term debt maturing in 2005 and 2006 is $1,343 million and $1,481 million, respectively. Because of our debt ratings, recent operating performance and other factors, access to such markets cannot be assured. The Companys ongoing ability to access the capital markets is highly dependent on successfully implementing its North American Tire turnaround strategy. In addition to facilitating access to the capital markets, successful implementation of the turnaround strategy is also crucial to ensuring that the Company has sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its obligations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing its turnaround strategy. Failure to complete the turnaround strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Although the Company is highly leveraged, it may become necessary for it to incur additional debt to ensure that it has adequate liquidity. This additional debt would need to be secured or unsecured. A substantial portion of the Companys assets are already subject to liens securing its indebtedness. The Company is limited in its ability to pledge its remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, unless the Companys financial performance improves, its ability to raise unsecured debt may be significantly limited. Under the Companys master contract with the USWA, the Company committed to consummate the issuance or placement of at least $250 million of debt securities and at least $75 million of equity or equity linked securities by December 31, 2003. It did not meet this commitment. As a result, the USWA may file a grievance and strike. In the event of a strike, the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. The Company has also committed to launch, by December 1, 2004, a refinancing of its U.S. term loan and revolving credit facilities due in April 2005, with loans or securities having a term of at least three years. If the Company fails to complete this refinancing commitment, the USWA would have the right to strike and the Company would be required to pay each covered union employee (approximately 13,700 as of December 31, 2003) $1,000 and each covered union retiree (approximately 13,800 as of December 31, 2003) $500. In addition, if the Company failed to comply with the covenants in its credit agreements, the lenders would have the right to cease further loans to the Company and demand the repayment of all outstanding loans under these facilities. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, including the Entran II litigation described in Note 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. The ultimate cost of disposing of Entran II claims is dependent upon a number of factors, including the Companys ability to satisfy the contingencies in a proposed settlement, the number of claimants that opt out of any settlement, final approval of the terms of the settlement at a fairness hearing, Goodyears ability to resolve claims not subject to the settlement (including the cases in which the Company received adverse judgments), and, in the event Goodyear fails to consummate the proposed settlement for any reason, future judgments by courts in other currently pending or yet unasserted actions. Depending on the resolution of these uncertainties, the costs associated with Entran II claims could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position and liquidity in future periods. In the event the Company wishes to appeal any future adverse judgment in any Entran II or other proceeding, it would be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant 53 Table of Contents court. If the Company does not have sufficient availability under its U.S. revolving credit facility to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond, it may be required to pay down borrowings under the facility in order to increase the amount available for issuing letters of credit or deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal. A significant deposit of cash collateral may have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity. A substantial portion of Goodyears borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose the Company to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the Companys debt service obligations would increase. An unanticipated significant rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity in future periods. In addition, Goodyear expects to make contributions to its pension plans of approximately $210 million in 2004. Contributions to domestic pension plans are expected to be approximately $160 million in 2004 and approximately $325 million to $350 million in 2005 in order to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements. Dividends On February 4, 2003, the Company announced that it eliminated its quarterly cash dividend. The dividend reduction was decided on by the Board of Directors in order to conserve cash. Under our restructured credit agreements, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock. Commitments & Contingencies The following table presents, at December 31, 2003, Goodyears obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts and contingent commitments. Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2003 (In millions) After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years Years Long Term Debt (1) $ 5,029.3 $ 246.9 $ 2,004.7 $ 1,542.8 $ 302.5 $ 103.0 $ 829.4 Capital Lease Obligations (2) 74.2 8.3 7.0 6.3 5.8 5.8 41.0 Operating Leases (3) 1,462.4 287.2 236.8 188.9 145.4 106.3 497.8 Binding Commitments (4) 520.1 482.2 14.7 8.0 2.3 1.8 11.1 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 7,086.0 $ 1,024.6 $ 2,263.2 $ 1,746.0 $ 456.0 $ 216.9 $ 1,379.3 (1) Long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of December 31, 2003. In connection with the Companys financing activities in the first quarter of 2004, our long term debt commitments in 2005 and 2006 were reduced by $665 million and $64 million, respectively. (2) The present value of capital lease obligations is $48.1 million. (3) Operating leases do not include minimum sublease rentals of $43.8 million, $33.7 million, $25.0 million, $18.0 million, $12.2 million, and $13.6 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $146.3 million. Net operating lease payments total $1,316.1 million. The present value of operating leases is $812.3 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, computers and office equipment, real estate and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (4) Binding commitments are for normal operations of the Company and include investments in land, buildings and equipment and raw materials purchased through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. In addition to the commitments summarized above, Goodyear is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. These contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Pension Plan Income Security Act (ERISA). Subject to change, Goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately $160 million in 2004 and approximately $325 million to $350 million in 2005 in order to satisfy these statutory minimum funding requirements. These estimates reflect legislation passed by Congress in 2004 providing for changes to ERISA 54 Table of Contents funding requirements to defer certain contributions to subsequent periods. Due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans, such as interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns, Goodyear is not able to reasonably estimate its future required contributions beyond 2005. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which can not be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of Goodyears global alliance with Sumitomo as set forth in the Umbrella Agreement between Goodyear and Sumitomo provide for certain minority exit rights available to Sumitomo commencing in 2009. In addition, the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the Umbrella Agreement, including certain bankruptcy events or changes in control of Goodyear, could trigger a right of Sumitomo to require Goodyear to purchase these interests immediately. Sumitomos exit rights, in the unlikely event of exercise, could require Goodyear to make a substantial payment to acquire Sumitomos interest in the alliance. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, Ansell Ltd. (Ansell) has the right, during the period beginning August 2005 and ending one year later, to require Goodyear to purchase Ansells 50% interest in SPT at a formula price based on the earnings of SPT. If Ansell does not exercise its right, Goodyear may require Ansell to sell its interest to Goodyear during the 180 days following the expiration of Ansells right at a price established using the same formula. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, Goodyear shall purchase minimum amounts of carbon black from a certain supplier from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2006, at agreed upon base prices that are subject to quarterly adjustments for changes in raw material costs and natural gas costs and a one time adjustment for other manufacturing costs. The Company does not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. The Company generally purchases raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. The Company will, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge its energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under certain derivative instruments or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period After 5 Total 1 Year 2 Years 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years Years (In millions) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (1) $ 74.4 $ 56.2 $ 0.7 $ 0.1 $ 4.9 $ 3.7 $ 8.8 (1) Off balance sheet arrangements include, at December 31, 2003, approximately $50.4 million related to an option held by Goodyears minority partner in Sava Tires to require Goodyear to purchase the partners 20% equity interest in Sava Tires. Goodyear has a similar call option on the remaining 20% interest. The minority partner could exercise its option and Goodyear could exercise its call option during various periods beginning in 2003 and extending through 2005. On April 7, 2004, Goodyear announced that it would exercise its call option and purchase the remaining 20% of Sava Tires. The transaction is expected to be completed in June 2004 and Goodyear expects to pay approximately $52 million at that time. 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk Goodyear continuously monitors its fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, Goodyear manages the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps. Goodyear will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce Goodyears risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates, and are normally designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used by Goodyear to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions. At December 31, 2003, the interest rates on 47% of Goodyears debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts, compared to 70% at December 31, 2002. The decrease in the percent of fixed rate debt was primarily due to the maturity of the 8 1/8% notes during 2003. Goodyear also has from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances. As a result of credit ratings actions and other related events, the Companys access to these instruments may be limited. The following tables present information at December 31: 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Interest Rate Swap Contracts Fixed Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 325.0 $ 325.0 Pay fixed rate 5.00 % 5.00 % Receive variable LIBOR 1.17 1.40 Average years to maturity 0.25 1.25 Fair value liability $ (3.1 ) $ (14.2 ) Pro forma fair value liability (3.1 ) (14.6 ) Floating Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 200.0 $ 250.0 Pay variable LIBOR 2.96 % 3.18 % Receive fixed rate 6.63 6.63 Average years to maturity 2.95 3.95 Fair value asset $ 13.0 $ 20.3 Pro forma fair value asset 12.3 21.4 The pro forma fair value assumes a 10% increase in variable market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. Weighted average interest rate swap contract information follows: 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in millions) Fixed Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 325.0 $ 325.0 $ 129.0 Pay fixed rate 5.00 % 5.00 % 5.43 % Receive variable LIBOR 1.24 1.91 3.58 Floating Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 207.0 $ 210.0 Pay variable LIBOR 3.03 % 3.68 % Receive fixed rate 6.63 6.63 56 Table of Contents The following table presents fixed rate debt information at December 31: 2003 2002 (In millions) Fixed Rate Debt: Fair value liability $ 2,107.9 $ 2,097.5 Carrying amount liability 2,228.7 2,484.1 Pro forma fair value liability 2,183.9 2,183.1 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity to changes in interest rates of Goodyears interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis. The model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk In order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows, Goodyear enters into foreign currency contracts. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales. In addition, the principal and interest on Goodyears Swiss franc bond due 2006 and Euro100 million of the Euro Notes due 2005 are hedged by currency swap agreements. Contracts hedging the Swiss franc bond and the Euro Notes are designated as cash flow hedges. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency contract information at December 31: 2003 2002 (In millions) Foreign Exchange Contracts Fair value asset (liability) $71.7 $65.2 Pro forma change in fair value (22.0 ) 37.6 Contract maturities 1/04 7/19 1/03 12/18 Fair value asset (liability): Swiss franc swap current $(1.6 ) $(2.8 ) Swiss franc swap long term 46.8 31.6 Euro swaps current 20.5 (1.1 ) Euro swaps long term 13.2 27.8 Other current asset 7.2 11.8 Other current (liability) (14.4 ) (2.1 ) The pro forma change in fair value assumes a 10% change in foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. At December 31, 2002, Goodyear held foreign currency Euro put options, exercisable during 2003, to reduce exposure to currency movements on 2003 forecasted intercompany sales. These options were designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2002, the underlying contract value of these options totaled $42.6 million, and the fair value totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company did not hold any outstanding foreign currency options. The sensitivity to changes in exchange rates of Goodyears foreign currency positions was determined using current market pricing models.
