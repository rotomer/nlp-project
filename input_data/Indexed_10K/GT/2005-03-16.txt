ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of tires and rubber products with one of the most recognized brand names in the world. We have a broad global footprint with 99 manufacturing facilities in 28 countries. Through December 31, 2004, our business was run through seven operating segments: North American Tire; European Union Tire; Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire (Eastern Europe Tire) (formerly known as Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire), Latin American Tire; Asia/ Pacific Tire (formerly known as Asia Tire); Engineered Products; and Chemical Products. In 2004, we had net income of $114.8 million, compared to significant net losses for 2003 and 2002 of $807.4 million (as restated) and $1,246.9 million (as restated), respectively. The net loss in 2002 included a non cash charge of $1.22 billion (as restated) to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. The improvement in 2004 compared to 2003 is due in part to: a decrease in net after tax rationalization charges of $215.1 million, an after tax gain from a settlement with certain insurance companies related to coverage for environmental matters of $156.6 million, a decrease in net after tax charges for accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs of $122.0 million, a decrease in net after tax charges for general and product liability discontinued products of $85.4 million (as restated), and an increase in net favorable tax adjustments of $10.5 million. Earnings in 2004 also benefited from an increase in segment operating income in each of our operating segments, as set forth below: Year Ended December 31, Restated 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Segment Operating Income North American Tire $ 31.5 $ (130.9 ) $ (58.1 ) European Union Tire 252.7 129.8 101.1 Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire 193.8 146.6 93.2 Latin American Tire 251.2 148.6 107.6 Asia/ Pacific Tire 61.1 49.9 43.7 Engineered Products 113.2 46.8 39.0 Chemical Products 177.0 120.2 88.2 In particular, our results are highly dependent upon the results of our North American Tire segment, which accounted for approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales in 2004. In recent years, North American Tire results have been negatively impacted by several factors, including over capacity which limits pricing leverage, weakness in the replacement tire market, increased competition from low cost manufacturers, a decline in market share and increases in medical and pension costs. In 2004, North American Tires segment operating income improved to $31.5 million on sales of approximately $7.9 billion. The improvement was due primarily to sustained improvement in pricing and a shift in product mix toward more profitable Goodyear brand tires. Additional improvement was a result of savings from rationalization programs, lower benefit costs and increased sales in the consumer replacement market and commercial markets. In addition, our second largest segment, European Union Tire, which accounted for approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales in 2004, had its segment operating income improve to $252.7 million on sales of approximately $4.5 billion. Approximately 11% of the increase in segment operating income from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to 30 Table of Contents currency translation, primarily the Euro. The improvement in European Union Tire also reflected improved pricing and product mix. Although our North American segments performance improved in 2004, it contributed just 2.9% of our total segment operating income on 41.0% of total segment sales, due primarily to legacy costs for North American retirees such as pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. In contrast, our Latin American and Eastern Europe Tire segments represented only 13.2% of our total segment sales in 2004, while approximately 41.2% of our total segment operating income came from these segments. As a result, increasing competition and unexpected changes in government policies or currency values in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our ability to sustain profitability. Effective January 1, 2005, Chemical Products was integrated into North American Tire. The integration will not change how we report net income. During 2004, $818.6 million, or 53.4%, of Chemical Products sales and 75.2% of its segment operating income resulted from intercompany transactions. Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, our total segment sales will no longer reflect these intercompany sales. In addition, the segment operating income previously attributable to Chemical Products intercompany transactions will no longer be included in the total segment operating income that we report. Higher raw material costs, particularly for natural rubber, continue to negatively impact our results. Raw material costs in our Cost of Goods Sold in 2004 increased by approximately $280 million from 2003. We expect that raw material costs will increase between 6% and 8% in 2005 compared to 2004. A key indicator of our operating performance is share of sales, especially in our two largest regions, North America and Western Europe. Listed below is our estimated share of sales in each of these two regions for our two primary tire markets: Original Equipment and Replacement. North America Western Europe Estimated Share Estimated Share of Sales of Sales 2004 2003 2004 2003 Original Equipment 39.8% 41.3% 23.7% 23.4% Replacement 25.4% 25.4% 23.4% 23.8% The above percentages are estimates only and are based on a combination of industry publications and surveys and internal company surveys. In North America, our 2004 share of sales in the replacement segment was comparable to our share in 2003. Our share of sales in the replacement market increased for the Goodyear brand while share of sales for the Dunlop brand decreased. Our 2004 share of sales in the North American original equipment market channel declined compared to 2003 due to our selective fitment strategy in the consumer original equipment business. In Western Europe, our 2004 share of replacement market sales decreased in all segments compared to 2003. OE market share increased in Western Europe due primarily to gains in the commercial market. We continue to have a significant amount of debt. On December 31, 2004, our debt (including capital leases) on a consolidated basis was $5.68 billion, compared to $5.08 billion at December 31, 2003. As a result of our increased debt level and higher average interest rates, our interest expense has continued to increase, reaching $368.8 million in 2004, compared to $296.3 million in 2003 and $242.7 million (as restated) in 2002. We anticipate undertaking refinancing activities in order to address $1.01 billion and $1.92 billion of long term debt maturing in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In addition, refinancing activities will address expected minimum required contributions to our domestic pension plans of approximately $400 million to $425 million in 2005 and $600 million to $775 million in 2006, and the need to enhance our financial flexibility and ensure adequate liquidity. In particular, our $650 million European credit facilities mature on April 30, 2005 and must be either extended or refinanced. As part of our refinancing efforts, we may seek to access the capital markets, although our current credit ratings may restrict our ability to do so. Failure to obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. In addition, we continue to review potential asset sales. We remain subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement of our historical financial statements. We are cooperating fully 31 Table of Contents with the SEC and have provided requested information as expeditiously as possible. Because the SEC investigation is currently ongoing, the outcome cannot be predicted at this time. In May 2004, following the conclusion of certain internal investigations initiated by our Audit Committee, our external auditors advised us that the circumstances they previously identified to us as collectively resulting in a material weakness in October 2003 had each individually become a material weakness. Our external auditors further identified an additional material weakness resulting from intentional overrides of internal controls by middle managerial personnel, particularly related to European Union Tire and workers compensation liability in the United States, which our internal investigation had identified and brought to the auditors attention. Item 9A of this Form 10 K provides a discussion of remediation activities undertaken relative to these previously identified material weaknesses and managements conclusions as to their status of December 31, 2004. In addition, Item 9A of this report discusses managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. That report concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of December 31, 2004, and cites two material weaknesses in our internal controls. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. We are currently implementing a remediation plan to address these matters. Our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or from the original equipment industry, which would result in lower levels of plant utilization that would increase unit costs. Also, we could experience higher raw material and energy costs in future periods. These costs, if incurred, may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market. Our future results of operations are also dependent on our ability to (i) successfully implement cost reduction programs to address, among other things, higher wage and benefit costs, and (ii) where necessary, reduce excess manufacturing capacity. We are unable to predict future currency fluctuations. Sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens against various foreign currencies, or if economic conditions deteriorate in the United States or Europe. Continued volatile economic conditions or changes in government policies in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods. We may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including war, acts of terror and civil obstructions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED (All per share amounts are diluted) Net sales in 2004 were $18.37 billion, compared to $15.12 billion (as restated) in 2003 and $13.86 billion (as restated) in 2002. Net income of $114.8 million, $0.63 per share, was recorded in 2004. A net loss of $807.4 million (as restated), $4.61 per share (as restated), was recorded in 2003. A net loss of $1.25 billion (as restated), $7.47 per share (as restated), was recorded in 2002, primarily resulting from a non cash charge of $1.22 billion (as restated), $6.95 per share (as restated) to establish a valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets. Net Sales Net sales in 2004 increased approximately $3.2 billion from 2003. The increase was due primarily to the consolidation of two affiliates deemed to be variable interest entities, South Pacific Tyres (SPT) and Tire & Wheels Assemblies (T&WA), in January 2004. The consolidation of these businesses increased net sales in 2004 by approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, improved pricing and product mix improvements in all SBUs, primarily in North American Tire, increased 2004 net sales by approximately $799 million. Higher unit volume in North American Tire, Latin American Tire, Eastern Europe Tire and European Union Tire, as well as higher volume in Engineered Products and Chemical Products, had a favorable impact on 2004 net sales of approximately $606 million. Currency translation, mainly in Europe, favorably affected 2004 net sales by approximately $542 million. 32 Table of Contents The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions of tires) North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 70.8 68.6 69.7 International 88.8 82.0 77.9 Replacement tire units 159.6 150.6 147.6 North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 31.7 32.6 34.1 International 32.0 30.3 32.6 OE tire units 63.7 62.9 66.7 Goodyear worldwide tire units 223.3 213.5 214.3 Our worldwide tire unit sales in 2004 increased 4.6% from 2003. North American Tire volume in 2004 increased 1.3% from 2003, while international unit sales increased 7.5%. Worldwide replacement unit sales in 2004 increased 6.0% from 2003, due primarily to the consolidation of SPT and improvement in North American Tire, Latin American Tire and Eastern Europe Tire. Original equipment unit sales in 2004 increased 1.2% from 2003, due primarily to the consolidation of SPT and improvement in Eastern Europe Tire, Latin American Tire and European Union Tire. Original equipment and replacement tire unit sales in 2004 increased by approximately 0.8 million and 5.5 million units, respectively, as a result of the consolidation of SPT. Net sales (as restated) in 2003 increased $1.2 billion from 2002 (as restated) due primarily to favorable currency translation of approximately $737 million, mainly in Europe. Favorable pricing and product mix in all business units, primarily Latin American Tire, Chemical Products and North American Tire, accounted for approximately $418 million of the increase in revenues. In Europe, strong replacement sales also had a favorable impact on 2003 net sales of approximately $104 million. Our worldwide tire unit sales in 2003 decreased 0.3% from 2002. North American Tire volume decreased 2.5% in 2003, while international unit sales increased 1.7%. Worldwide replacement unit sales in 2003 increased 2.0% from 2002, due to increases in all regions except North American Tire and Asia/ Pacific Tire. Original equipment unit sales decreased 5.6% in 2003, due primarily to a decrease in North American Tire. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was $14.71 billion in 2004, compared to $12.50 billion in 2003 and $11.31 billion in 2002. CGS was 80.1% of sales in 2004, compared to 82.7% in 2003 and 81.6% in 2002. CGS in 2004 increased by approximately $1.0 billion due to the previously mentioned consolidation of SPT and T&WA in accordance with FIN 46, by approximately $429 million in 2004 due to higher volume and approximately $409 million due to currency translation, primarily in Europe. Manufacturing costs related to changes in product mix increased 2004 CGS by approximately $210 million. In addition, 2004 raw material costs increased by approximately $280 million, although conversion costs were flat. Savings from rationalization programs totaling approximately $127 million favorably affected CGS in 2004. CGS in 2004 also includes a fourth quarter benefit of approximately $23.4 million ($19.3 million after tax or $0.09 per share) resulting from a settlement with certain suppliers of various raw materials. CGS (as restated) in 2003 increased by approximately $554 million from 2002 due to currency movements, primarily in Europe. In addition, raw material costs in 2003, largely for natural and synthetic rubber, rose by approximately $335 million. CGS in 2003 also increased by approximately $133 million due to accelerated depreciation charges, asset impairment charges and write offs related to 2003 rationalization actions. Manufacturing costs related to improvements in product mix, primarily in North American Tire, increased 2003 CGS by approximately $184 million. In addition, costs increased in Latin American Tire due to inflation. Savings from rationalization programs of approximately $61 million, mainly in European Union Tire and North American Tire, and the change in vacation policy described below of approximately 33 Table of Contents $33 million favorably affected 2003 CGS. CGS in 2003 included $16.8 million of net charges related to Engineered Products account reconciliations that were recorded in conjunction with the restatement. Research and development expenditures are expensed in CGS as incurred and were $378.2 million in 2004, compared to $351.0 million (as restated) in 2003 and $386.5 million (as restated) in 2002. Research and development expenditures in 2005 are expected to be approximately $380 to $390 million. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) was $2.83 billion in 2004, compared to $2.37 billion in 2003 and $2.20 billion in 2002. SAG in 2004 was 15.4% of sales, compared to 15.7% in 2003 and 15.9% in 2002. SAG increased by approximately $200 million in 2004 due to the previously mentioned consolidation of SPT and T&WA in accordance with FIN 46. SAG in 2004 included expenses of approximately $30 million for professional fees associated with the restatement and SEC investigation, and approximately $25 million for Sarbanes Oxley compliance. We estimate that external costs for Sarbanes Oxley compliance will be approximately $10 million to $15 million in 2005. Currency translation, primarily in Europe, increased SAG in 2004 by approximately $101 million. Advertising expenses were approximately $46 million higher due in part to the launch of the Assurance tire in North America, and wage and benefit costs rose by approximately $46 million. SAG in 2004 benefited from approximately $28 million in savings from rationalization programs. SAG (as restated) increased in 2003 due primarily to currency translation, mainly in Europe, of approximately $132 million and higher wages and benefits of approximately $72 million. SAG also reflected increased advertising expense, largely in European Union Tire and North American Tire, of approximately $29 million and increased corporate consulting fees of approximately $23 million. SAG was favorably affected by savings from rationalization programs of approximately $74 million and by the change in vacation policy described below of approximately $34 million. Other Cost Reduction Measures During 2002, we announced the suspension of the matching contribution portion of our savings plans for all salaried associates, effective January 1, 2003. Effective April 20, 2003, we suspended the matching contribution portion of the savings plan for bargaining unit associates, including those covered by our master contract with the USWA. We contributed approximately $38 million to the savings plans in 2002. In addition, we changed our vacation policy for domestic salaried associates in 2002. As a result of the changes to the policy, we did not incur vacation expense for domestic salaried associates in 2003. Vacation expense was approximately $67 million lower in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the impact of this change in vacation policy. Interest Expense Interest expense in 2004 was $368.8 million, compared to $296.3 million in 2003 and $242.7 million (as restated) in 2002. Interest expense increased in 2004 from 2003 due to higher average debt levels, higher average interest rates and the April 1, 2003 restructuring and refinancing of our credit facilities. Interest expense increased in 2003 from 2002 (as restated) due to higher average debt levels. While we expect interest expense to increase in 2005 due to higher interest rates and higher average debt levels, we expect that the $3.35 billion refinancing we announced in February 2005 will partially offset this increase by reducing the amount over LIBOR we pay to borrow under the refinanced facilities. Other (Income) and Expense Other (income) and expense was $8.2 million in 2004, compared to $263.4 million (as restated) in 2003 and $56.8 million in 2002. Other (income) and expense included accounts receivable sales fees, debt refinancing fees and commitment fees totaling $116.5 million, $99.4 million and $48.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The higher level of financing fees and financial instruments in 2003 and 2004 was due to costs resulting from refinancing activities in those years. Amounts in 2004 included $20.5 million of deferred costs written off in connection with refinancing activities in 2004. Financing fees and financial instruments included $45.6 million in 2003 related to new facilities in that year. Refer to the Note to the Financial Statements 34 Table of Contents No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information about refinancing activities. We expect to incur additional financing fees in the future related to refinancings and capital market transactions. Other (income) and expense included net charges for general and product liability discontinued products totaling $52.7 million, $138.1 million (as restated) and $33.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These net charges related to asbestos personal injury claims and for liabilities related to Entran II claims, net of insurance recoveries. Of the $52.7 million of net expense recorded in 2004, $41.4 million related to Entran II claims ($141.4 million of expense and $100.0 million of insurance recoveries) and $11.3 million related to asbestos claims ($13.0 million of expense and $1.7 million of probable insurance recoveries). Of the $138.1 million (as restated) of net expense recorded in 2003, $180.4 million related to Entran II claims ($255.4 million of expense and $75.0 million of insurance recoveries) and $(42.3) million (as restated) related to asbestos claims ($24.3 million of expense and $66.6 of probable insurance recoveries). Of the $33.8 million of net expense recorded in 2002, $9.8 million related to Entran II claims and $24.0 million related to asbestos claims. We did not record any probable insurance recoveries in 2002. Refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, for further information about general and product liabilities. Other (income) and expense in 2004 included a gain of $13.3 million ($10.3 million after tax or $0.05 per share) on the sale of assets in North American Tire, European Union Tire and Engineered Products. In addition, a loss of $17.5 million ($17.8 million after tax or $0.09 per share) was recorded in 2004 on the sale of corporate assets and assets in North American Tire, European Union Tire and Chemical Products, including a loss of $14.5 million ($15.6 million after tax or $0.08 per share) on the write down of the assets of our natural rubber plantations in Indonesia. Other (income) and expense in 2004 also included a charge of $11.7 million ($11.6 million after tax or $0.07 per share) for insurance fire loss deductibles related to fires at our facilities in Germany, France and Thailand. During 2004, approximately $36 million in insurance recoveries were received related to these fire losses. Other (income) and expense in the 2004 fourth quarter included a benefit of $156.6 million ($156.6 million after tax or $0.75 per share) resulting from a settlement with certain insurance companies. We will receive $159.4 million ($156.6 million plus imputed interest of $2.8 million) in installments in 2005 and 2006 in exchange for releasing the insurers from certain past, present and future environmental claims. A significant portion of the costs incurred by us related to these claims had been recorded over the prior years. Other (income) and expense in 2003 included a loss of $17.6 million ($8.9 million after tax or $0.05 per share) on the sale of 20,833,000 shares of common stock of Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. in the second quarter. A loss of $14.4 million ($13.2 million after tax or $0.08 per share) was recorded in 2003 on the sale of assets in Engineered Products, North American Tire and European Union Tire. A gain of $6.9 million ($5.8 million after tax or $0.04 per share) was recorded in 2003 resulting from the sale of assets in Asia/ Pacific Tire, Latin American Tire and European Union Tire. Other (income) and expense in 2002 included gains of $28.0 million ($23.7 million after tax or $0.14 per share) resulting from the sale of assets in Latin American Tire, Engineered Products and European Union Tire. The write off of a miscellaneous investment of $4.1 million ($4.1 million after tax or $0.02 per share) was also included in Other (income) and expense in 2002. For further information, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 4, Other (Income) and Expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Net foreign currency exchange loss was $23.4 million in 2004, compared to a net loss of $40.7 million (as restated) in 2003 and a net gain of $8.7 million (as restated) in 2002. Foreign currency exchange loss in 2004 was lower than in 2003 (as restated), as 2003 (as restated) reflected the weakening of the Brazilian Real versus the U.S. dollar. The loss in 2003 (as restated) included approximately $48 million of increased losses versus 2002 due to currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Brazil and Chile. Net 35 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange gain in 2002 (as restated) benefited by approximately $16 million from currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Brazil. A loss of approximately $8 million resulting from currency movements on U.S. dollar denominated monetary items in Argentina was also recorded in 2002. Equity in (Earnings) Losses of Affiliates Equity in earnings of affiliates in 2004 was income of $8.4 million, compared to a loss of $14.5 million (as restated) in 2003 and a loss of $13.8 million (as restated) in 2002. The improvement in 2004 was due primarily to improved results at Rubbernetwork.com and the consolidation of South Pacific Tyres (SPT). Our share of losses at SPT was included in 2003 and 2002. SPT was consolidated effective January 1, 2004, pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46. Income Taxes For 2004, we recorded tax expense of $207.9 million on income before income taxes and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries of $380.5 million. For 2003, we recorded tax expense of $117.1 million (as restated) on a loss before income taxes and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries of $657.5 million (as restated). For 2002, we recorded tax expense of $1.23 billion (as restated) on income before income taxes and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries of $36.6 million (as restated). The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets. In 2002 we recorded a non cash charge of $1.22 billion (as restated) ($6.95 per share (as restated)) to establish this valuation allowance. Income tax expense in 2004 includes net favorable tax adjustments totaling $60.1 million. These adjustments related primarily to the settlement of prior years tax liabilities. In 2002, we determined that earnings of certain international subsidiaries would no longer be permanently reinvested in working capital. Accordingly, we recorded a provision of $50.2 million for the incremental taxes incurred or to be incurred upon inclusion of such earnings in Federal taxable income. The American Job Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law in October 2004 and replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. As we are both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer and in a U.S. tax loss position, this change should have no material impact on our income tax provision. The Act also provides for a special one time tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated no later than 2005. We have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision. We do not anticipate that the repatriation of foreign earnings under the Act would provide an overall tax benefit to us. However, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until our 2005 tax position has been more precisely determined and the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Treasury Department provide additional guidance on certain of the Acts provisions. Any repatriation of earnings under the Act is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is probable that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2004, we had not recognized tax benefits of approximately $180 million relating to the reorganization of legal entities in 2001. Pursuant to the reorganization, our tax payments have been reduced by approximately $67 million through December 31, 2004. Should the ultimate outcome be unfavorable, we would be required to make a cash payment for all tax reductions claimed as of that date. For further information, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 14, Income Taxes. 36 Table of Contents Rationalization Activity To maintain global competitiveness, we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years for the purpose of reducing excess capacity, eliminating redundancies and reducing costs. We recorded net rationalization costs of $55.6 million in 2004, $291.5 million in 2003 and $5.5 million in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, we had reduced employment levels by approximately 6,800 from January 1, 2002 and approximately 18,000 since January 1, 2000, primarily as a result of rationalization activities. 2004 In 2004, net charges were recorded totaling $55.6 million ($52.0 million after tax or $0.27 per share). The net charges included reversals of $39.2 million ($32.2 million after tax or $0.17 per share) related to reserves from rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purpose, and new charges of $94.8 million ($84.2 million after tax or $0.44 per share). Included in the $94.8 million of new charges are $77.4 million for plans initiated in 2004. These plans consisted of warehouse, manufacturing and sales and marketing associate reductions in Engineered Products, a farm tire manufacturing consolidation in European Union Tire, administrative associate reductions in North American Tire, European Union Tire and corporate functional groups, and manufacturing, sales and research and development associate reductions in Chemical Products. Approximately 1,400 associates will be released under programs initiated in 2004, of which approximately 640 were released by December 31, 2004. The costs of the 2004 actions consisted of $40.1 million related to future cash outflows, primarily for associate severance costs, $31.9 million in non cash pension curtailments and postretirement benefit costs, and $5.4 million of noncancelable lease costs and other exit costs. Costs in 2004 also included $16.3 million related to plans initiated in 2003, consisting of $13.7 million for noncancelable lease costs and other exit costs and $2.6 million of associate related costs. The reversals are primarily the result of lower than initially estimated associate severance costs of $34.9 million and lower leasehold and other exit costs of $4.3 million. Of the $34.9 million of associate severance cost reversals, $12.0 million related to previously approved plans in Engineered Products that were reorganized into the 2004 warehouse, manufacturing, and sales and marketing associate reductions. In 2004, $75.0 million was incurred primarily for associate severance payments, $34.6 million for non cash pension curtailments and postretirement benefit costs, and $22.9 million was incurred for noncancelable lease costs and other costs. The remaining accrual balance for all programs was $67.6 million at December 31, 2004, substantially all of which is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months. In addition, accelerated depreciation charges totaling $10.4 million were recorded in 2004 for fixed assets that will be taken out of service in connection with certain rationalization plans initiated in 2004 and 2003 in European Union Tire, Latin American Tire and Engineered Products. During 2004, $7.7 million was recorded as CGS and $2.7 million was recorded as SAG. 2003 In 2003, net charges were recorded totaling $291.5 million ($267.1 million after tax or $1.52 per share). The net charges included reversals of $15.7 million ($14.3 million after tax or $0.08 per share) related to reserves from rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purpose, and new charges of $307.2 million ($281.4 million after tax or $1.60 per share). The 2003 rationalization actions consisted of manufacturing, research and development, administrative and retail consolidations in North America, Europe and Latin America. Of the $307.2 million of new charges, $174.8 million related to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance costs, and $132.4 million related primarily to non cash special termination benefits and pension and retiree benefit curtailments. Approximately 4,400 associates will be released under the programs initiated in 2003, of which approximately 2,700 were exited in 2003 and approximately 1,500 were exited during 2004. The reversals are primarily the result of lower than initially estimated associate related payments of approximately $12 million, favorable sublease contract signings in the European Union of approximately $3 million and lower contract termination costs in the United States of approximately $1 million. These reversals do not represent changes in the plans as originally approved by management. 37 Table of Contents As part of the 2003 rationalization program, we closed our Huntsville, Alabama tire facility in the fourth quarter of 2003. Of the $307.2 million of new rationalization charges in 2003, approximately $138 million related to the Huntsville closure and were primarily for associate related costs, including severance, special termination benefits and pension and retiree benefit curtailments. The Huntsville closure also resulted in charges to CGS of approximately $35 million for asset impairments and $85 million for accelerated depreciation and the write off of spare parts. In addition, 2003 CGS included charges totaling approximately $8 million to write off construction in progress related to the research and development rationalization plan, and approximately $5 million for accelerated depreciation on equipment taken out of service at European Union Tires facility in Wolverhampton, England. 2002 In 2002, net charges were recorded totaling $5.5 million ($6.4 million after tax or $0.03 per share). The net charges included reversals of $18.0 million ($14.3 million after tax or $0.09 per share) for reserves from rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purpose. In addition, new charges were recorded totaling $26.5 million ($23.0 million after tax or $0.14 per share) and other credits were recorded totaling $3.0 million ($2.3 million after tax or $0.02 per share). The 2002 rationalization actions consisted of a manufacturing facility consolidation in Europe, the closure of a mold manufacturing facility and a plant consolidation in the United States, and administrative consolidations. Of the $26.5 million charge, $24.2 million related to future cash outflows, primarily associate severance costs, and $2.3 million related to non cash write offs of equipment taken out of service in the Engineered Products and North American Tire Segments. General Upon completion of the 2004 plans, we estimate that annual operating costs will be reduced by approximately $110 million (approximately $50 million CGS and approximately $60 million SAG), of which $9 million was realized during 2004. We estimate that CGS and SAG were reduced in 2004 by approximately $120 million and $64 million, respectively, as a result of the implementation of the 2003 plans. Plan savings have been substantially offset by higher SAG and conversion costs including increased compensation and benefit costs. The remaining reserve for costs related to the completion of our rationalization actions was $67.6 million and $143.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For further information, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 3, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share (EITF 04 08). This pronouncement requires shares issuable under contingent conversion provisions in debt agreements to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, if the impact is dilutive, regardless of whether the provisions of the contingent features had been met. The provisions of EITF 04 08 are effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. Retroactive restatement of diluted earnings per share is required. There are contingent conversion features included in our $350 million 4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2034, issued on July 2, 2004. Accordingly, average shares outstanding diluted in 2004 included approximately 29.1 million contingently issuable shares in each of the third and fourth quarters and 14.5 million shares in the full year. Net income per share diluted in 2004 included an earnings adjustment representing avoided after tax interest expense of $3.5 million in each of the third and fourth quarters, reflecting the assumed conversion. Diluted earnings per share in 2004 were reduced by approximately $0.02 in the third quarter, $0.08 in the fourth quarter and $0.01 in the full year as a result of the adoption of this standard. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position No. 129 1, Disclosure Requirements under FASB Statement No. 129, Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure, Relating to Contingently Convertible Securities (FSP 129 1). FSP 129 1 clarified certain disclosure requirements of 38 Table of Contents the contingent conversion features of convertible securities. FSP 129 1 was effective immediately upon its release. Our disclosures related to our $350 million 4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2034 are in compliance with the disclosure requirements of FSP 129 1. The FASB issued, on May 19, 2004, FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP 106 2). FSP 106 2 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new Medicare prescription drug legislation by employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under Medicare Part D. It also contains basic guidance on related income tax accounting, and complex rules for transition that permit various alternative prospective and retroactive transition approaches. Based on the proposed regulations, during 2004 we determined that the overall impact of the adoption of FSP 106 2 was a reduction of expense in 2004 and in future annual periods of approximately $2 million on an annual basis. The adoption of FSP 106 2 also reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $19.7 million during 2004. On January 21, 2005 final regulations were issued. Based on the clarifications provided in the final regulations, our net periodic postretirement cost is expected to be lower by approximately $50 million in 2005, and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is expected to be reduced by approximately $475 million to $525 million during 2005. The FASB has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, companies are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. We must adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005 (i.e. the third quarter of 2005), with early adoption encouraged. SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled by us after June 30, 2005. SFAS 123R allowed companies various transition approaches. We are currently assessing the timing and the transition method that we will use for the adoption of SFAS 123R. We expect to recognize additional compensation cost of approximately $3 million to $4 million per quarter that was not previously required to be recognized, beginning in the quarter in which we first implement the provisions of SFAS 123R. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act, when fully phased in, includes a tax deduction of up to 9 percent of the lesser of (a) qualified production activities income or (b) taxable income, both as defined in the Act. In addition, the Act includes a special one time tax deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated no later than in the 2005 tax year. The FASB issued two staff positions to address the accounting for income taxes in conjunction with the Act. FASB Staff Position No. 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 1), was effective upon its release on December 22, 2004. FSP 109 1 requires us to treat the tax deduction as a special deduction instead of a change in tax rate that would have impacted our existing deferred tax balances. Based on current earnings levels, this provision should not have a material impact on our income tax provision. FASB Staff Position No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2), established accounting and disclosure requirements for enterprises in the process of evaluating, or completing the evaluation of, the repatriation provision of the Act. We have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision. We do not anticipate repatriating foreign earnings under the Act, as it may not provide an overall tax benefit. However, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until our 2005 tax position has been more precisely determined and U.S. Congress or the U.S. Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. If we ultimately determine to elect to repatriate earnings under the Act, it would not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 39 Table of Contents The FASB has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151). The provisions of SFAS 151 are intended to eliminate narrow differences between the existing accounting standards of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) related to inventory costs, in particular, abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 requires that these costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of the extent to which they are considered abnormal. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The FASB has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 (SFAS 153). The provisions of SFAS 153 are intended to eliminate narrow differences between the existing accounting standards of the FASB and the IASB related to the value on which the measurement of nonmonetary exchanges should be based. APB Opinion No. 29 (APB 29) provides that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. An exception was provided in APB 29 to measure exchanges of similar productive assets based on book values. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception in APB 29 for similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS 153 are effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The EITF issued Topic 03 06, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, (EITF 03 06). EITF 03 06 requires the use of the two class method of computing EPS for enterprises with participating securities or multiple classes of common stock. The provisions of EITF 03 06 are effective for fiscal periods beginning after March 31, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03 06 did not have an impact on our EPS. UNION AGREEMENT Our master contract with the USWA committed us to consummate the issuance or placement of at least $250 million of debt securities and at least $75 million of equity or equity linked securities by December 31, 2003 or the USWA would have the right to file a grievance and strike. On March 12, 2004, we completed a private offering of $650 million in senior secured notes due 2011, consisting of $450 million of 11% senior secured notes and $200 million of floating rate notes at LIBOR plus 8%. On July 2, 2004, we completed a private offering of $350 million in 4% convertible senior notes due 2034 (an equity linked security). Under the master contract we also committed to launch, by December 1, 2004, a refinancing of our U.S. term loan and revolving credit facilities due in April 2005, with loans or securities having a term of at least three years. We completed the refinancing of the U.S. term loan in March 2004 and refinanced the U.S. revolving credit facility in August 2004. In the event of a strike by the USWA, our operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include: general and product liability and other litigation environmental liabilities workers compensation recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 40 Table of Contents deferred tax asset valuation allowance pension and other postretirement benefits allowance for doubtful accounts On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements analysis that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claim and were determined after review by our in house counsel, external counsel or a combination thereof. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases could impact our assessment of the probability and estimate of our loss, which could have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record insurance recovery receivables related to our litigation claims when it is probable we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos 1) in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past, or 2) in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in state and Federal courts. Due to the potential exposure that the asbestos claims represent, we began using an independent asbestos valuation firm in connection with the preparation of our 2003 financial statements. The firm was engaged to review our existing reserves for pending claims, determine whether or not we could make a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and review our method of determining our receivables from probable insurance recoveries. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, our estimate for asbestos liability was based upon a review of the various characteristics of the pending claims by an experienced asbestos counsel. In addition, at that time we did not have an accrual for unasserted claims, as sufficient information was deemed to be not available to reliably estimate such an obligation prior to the fourth quarter of 2003. After reviewing our recent settlement history by jurisdiction, law firm, disease type and alleged date of first exposure, the valuation firm cited two primary reasons for us to refine our valuation assumptions. First, in calculating our estimated liability, the valuation firm determined that we had previously assumed that we would resolve more claims in the foreseeable future than is likely based on our historical record and nationwide trends. As a result, we now assume that a smaller percentage of pending claims will be resolved within the predictable future. Second, the valuation firm determined that it was not possible to estimate a liability for as many non malignancy claims as we had done in the past. As a result, our current estimated liability includes fewer liabilities associated with non malignancy claims than were included prior to December 2003. A significant assumption in our estimated liability is that it represents our estimated liability through 2008, which represents the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future could result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase could be significant. We had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $119.3 million at December 31, 2004 and $134.7 million (as restated) at December 31, 2003. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims was $37.9 million at December 31, 2004 and $54.4 million (as restated) at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, our liability with respect to asserted claims and related defense costs was $81.4 million, compared to $80.3 million (as restated) at December 31, 2003. 41 Table of Contents We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. Prior to 2003, we did not record a receivable for expected recoveries from excess carriers in respect of asbestos related matters. We have instituted coverage actions against certain of these excess carriers. After consultation with our outside legal counsel and giving consideration to relevant factors, including the ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers, their financial viability, their legal obligations and other pertinent facts, we determined an amount we expect is probable of recovery from such carriers. Accordingly, we recorded a receivable during 2003, which represents an estimate of recovery from our excess coverage insurance carriers relating to potential asbestos related liabilities. The valuation firm also reviewed our method of valuing receivables recorded for probable insurance recoveries. Based upon the model employed by the valuation firm, as of December 31, 2004, (i) we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $107.8 million, compared to $121.3 million (as restated) at December 31, 2003, and (ii) we expect that approximately 90% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable up to our accessible policy limits through the period covered by the estimated liability. The receivable recorded consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Of this amount, $9.4 million and $11.8 million (as restated) was included in Current assets as part of Accounts and notes receivable at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition to our asbestos claims, we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our Entran II rubber hose product. During 2004, we entered into a settlement agreement to address a substantial portion of our Entran II liabilities. The claims associated with the plaintiffs that opted not to participate in the settlement will be evaluated in a manner consistent with our other litigation claims. We had recorded liabilities related to Entran II claims totaling $307.2 million at December 31, 2004 and $246.1 million at December 31, 2003. Environmental Matters. We had recorded liabilities totaling $39.5 million at December 31, 2004 and $32.6 million (as restated) at December 31, 2003 for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters, primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by us. Our environmental liabilities are based upon our best estimate of the cost to remediate the identified locations. Our process for estimating the costs entails management selecting the best remediation alternative based upon either an internal analysis or third party studies and proposals. Our estimates are based upon the current law and approved remediation technology. The actual cost that will be incurred may differ from these estimates based upon changes in environmental laws and standards, approval of new environmental remediation technology, and the extent to which other responsible parties ultimately contribute to the remediation efforts. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, totaling $230.7 million and $195.7 million (as restated) for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The increase in the liability from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to an increase in reserves for existing claims, reflecting revised estimates of our ultimate liability in these cases, and updated actuarial assumptions related to unasserted claims. At December 31, 2004, the liability was discounted using the risk free rate of return. For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, environmental matters and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingencies. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Generally accepted accounting principles do not permit goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be amortized. Rather, these assets must be tested annually for 42 Table of Contents impairment. The impairment testing would have to be performed more frequently than on an annual basis as a result of the occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment. For purposes of our annual impairment testing, we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based upon an EBITDA multiple using comparable companies in the global automotive industry sector and a discounted cash flow approach. The EBITDA multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions. The EBITDA of the reporting units are adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges. EBITDA is based upon a combination of historical and forecasted results. Significant decreases in EBITDA in future periods could be an indication of a potential impairment. Additionally, valuation multiples in the global automotive industry sector would have to decline in excess of 25% to indicate a potential goodwill impairment. Goodwill totaled $720.3 million and other intangible assets totaled $162.6 million at December 31, 2004. We completed our 2004 annual valuation during the third quarter of 2004. The valuation indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance. At December 31, 2004, we had valuation allowances aggregating $2.1 billion against all of our net Federal and state and some of our foreign net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. In accordance with SFAS 109, evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our U.S. losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets under SFAS 109. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of such assets. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions, including: future health care costs, maximum company covered benefit costs, life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets, and future compensation levels. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries. Assumptions about future health care costs, life expectancies, retirement rates and future compensation levels are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher by S&P. The total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over periods of 15 years or more, asset class return expectations and long term inflation. These assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate, and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of our recorded net expenses for these benefits. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected. The discount rate used in determining the recorded liability for our U.S. pension and postretirement plans was 5.75% for 2004, compared to 6.25% for 2003 and 6.75% for 2002. The decrease in the rate was due primarily to lower interest rates on long term highly rated corporate bonds. As a result, interest cost included in our net periodic pension cost increased to $421.0 million in 2004, compared to $399.8 million in 2003 and $385.0 million in 2002. Interest cost included in our net periodic postretirement cost was $188.1 million in 43 Table of Contents 2004, compared to $174.0 million in 2003 and $186.9 million in 2002. Actual return on plan assets was 12.1% in 2004, compared to expected returns of 8.5%. The following table presents the sensitivity of our projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement obligation, shareholders equity, and 2005 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: +/ Change at December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Pensions: Change PBO/ABO Equity 2005 Expense Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5% $ 260 $ 260 $ 14 Actual return on assets +/ 1.0% N/A 30 32 Estimated return on assets +/ 1.0% N/A N/A 30 Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5% $ 148 N/A $ 4 Health care cost trends total cost +/ 1.0% 14 N/A 2 For further information on pensions, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 13, Pensions, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents an estimate of the losses expected from our accounts and notes receivable portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by region, portfolio duration, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $144.4 million and $128.9 million (as restated) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects our strategic business units (SBUs), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. The Tire business is managed on a regional basis. Engineered Products and Chemical Products are managed on a global basis. Results of operations in the Tire and Engineered Products segments were measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Results of operations of Chemical Products were measured based on net sales (including sales to other SBUs) and segment operating income. Segment operating income included transfers to other SBUs. Segment operating income was computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding accelerated depreciation charges, asset impairment charges and asset write offs) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also included equity in (earnings) losses of most unconsolidated affiliates. Equity in (earnings) losses of certain unconsolidated affiliates, including SPT (in 2003 and 2002) and Rubbernetwork.com, was not included in segment operating income. Segment operating income did not include the previously discussed segment rationalization charges, asset sales and certain asset impairments and write offs. Total segment operating income was $1.08 billion in 2004, $511.0 million (as restated) in 2003 and $414.7 million (as restated) in 2002. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2004 was 5.6%, compared to 3.2% (as restated) in 2003 and 2.9% in 2002. Effective January 1, 2004, we consolidated our investments in T&WA and SPT pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R. In 2003 and 2002, results of operations of T&WA and SPT were reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations using the equity method. Equity in earnings (loss) of T&WA was included in North American Tire segment operating income in those years. 44 Table of Contents Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income, as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 18, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income (Loss) before Income Taxes. North American Tire Year Ended December 31, Restated 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Tire Units 102.5 101.2 103.8 Net Sales $ 7,854.6 $ 6,745.6 $ 6,703.0 Operating Income (Loss) 31.5 (130.9 ) (58.1 ) Operating Margin 0.4 % (1.9 )% (0.9 )% North American Tire unit sales in 2004 increased 1.3 million units or 1.3% from 2003 but decreased 1.3 million units or 1.3% from 2002. Replacement unit sales in 2004 increased 2.2 million units or 3.2% from 2003 and 1.1 million units or 1.6% from 2002. Original equipment volume in 2004 decreased 0.9 million units or 2.6% from 2003 and 2.4 million units or 7.1% from 2002. Replacement unit volume in 2004 increased from 2003 due primarily to higher sales of Goodyear brand tires.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2004, we had $1.97 billion in cash and cash equivalents as well as $1.12 billion of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $1.55 billion and $335.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Cash and cash equivalents do not include restricted cash. Restricted cash included the settlement fund balance related to Entran II litigation as well as cash deposited in support of trade agreements and performance bonds, and historically has included cash deposited in support of borrowings incurred by subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004, cash balances totaling $152.4 million were subject to such restrictions, compared to $23.9 million at December 31, 2003. Our ability to service our debt depends in part on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In recent years, our foreign subsidiaries have been a significant source of cash flow. In certain countries where we operate, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans or advances are generally or periodically subject to various restrictive governmental regulations and there may be adverse tax consequences to such transfers. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments restrict the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash.

The reconciliation of net income to cash flows from operating activities also included adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities. Significant adjustments in 2004 included: a negative adjustment for Accounts receivable, reflecting increased levels of customer financing due in part to higher tire unit sales, pricing improvements and a shift in mix toward replacement tires (which generally have longer terms than OE tires). a positive adjustment for Accounts payable, reflecting increased levels of financing by our suppliers due in part to increased raw material costs, a positive adjustment for long term Compensation and benefits, due in part to non cash charges for an increase in anticipated benefit payments in future periods resulting primarily from changes in actuarial assumptions, and a positive adjustment for Other long term liabilities, due primarily to non cash charges for anticipated payments in future periods related to general and product liabilities. Cash payments for operating activities included the following: Year Ended December 31, Restated 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Interest $ 356.5 $ 282.5 $ 259.7 Taxes 201.3 73.0 125.9 Rationalizations 132.5 214.8 61.2 Cash payments for interest increased due primarily to higher average debt levels, increased interest rates and the April 1, 2003 restructuring and refinancing of our credit facilities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $525.2 million during 2004, compared to $236.0 million in 2003 and $540.3 million in 2002. Capital expenditures were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Capital expenditures $ 518.6 $ 375.4 $ 458.1 Capital expenditures in 2004 were $518.6 million, of which $294.0 million was used on projects to increase capacity and improve productivity and quality, and $224.6 million was used for tire molds and various other projects. Capital expenditures were reduced in 2003 in response to business conditions and limitations prescribed by certain of our borrowing arrangements. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $640 million in 2005, including approximately $350 million for manufacturing improvements and approximately $290 million for molds and various other projects. At December 31, 2004, we had binding commitments for raw materials and investments in land, buildings and equipment of $755.9 million, and off balance sheet financial guarantees written and other commitments totaling $18.2 million. 53 Table of Contents Cash used for asset acquisitions was $61.8 million in 2004. In June 2004, we exercised our call option and a subsidiary in Luxembourg purchased the remaining 20% of outstanding shares that it did not already own of Sava Tires d.o.o. (Sava Tires), a joint venture tire manufacturing company in Kranj, Slovenia, for $51.4 million. On July 13, 2004, we purchased the remaining 50% ownership interest that we did not already own of Dckia, a major tire retail group in Sweden, for $10.4 million. Cash provided by asset dispositions in 2003 was $104.4 million, and included net proceeds from the sale of assets in the United States of $85.8 million, in Europe of $14.5 million, in Latin America of $2.0 million and in Asia of $2.1 million. Included in the United States total of $85.8 million is $82.9 million for the sale of 20.8 million shares of SRI. Cash used for asset acquisitions in 2003 included the purchase of Arkansas Best Corporations 19% ownership interest in Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC (Wingfoot) for $71.2 million. Wingfoot was a joint venture company formed by Goodyear and Arkansas Best Corporation to sell and service commercial truck tires, provide retread services and conduct related business. Cash provided by asset dispositions in 2002 was $55.6 million, and included net proceeds from the sale of assets in the United States of $1.3 million, in Europe of $28.7 million and in Latin America of $23.3 million. Cash used for asset acquisitions in 2002 was $54.8 million. We acquired additional shares of our tire manufacturing subsidiary in Slovenia at a cost of $38.9 million. We also acquired additional shares of our tire manufacturing subsidiary in Turkey at a cost of $15.9 million. For further information on investing activities, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 8, Investments. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $189.1 million in 2004, compared to $1,087.1 million in 2003 and $(167.5) million in 2002. Consolidated debt and our ratio of debt to debt and equity follows: December 31, Restated 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Consolidated debt $ 5,679.6 $ 5,086.0 $ 3,642.7 Debt to debt and equity 98.7 % 100.6 % 94.3 % Consolidated debt increased in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to certain financing actions in 2004 including the completion of a $350 million convertible senior notes offering as well as the termination of off balance sheet account receivable securitization programs in Europe and the consolidation of VIEs as defined by FIN 46. Consolidated debt increased in 2003 from 2002 due primarily to the April 1, 2003 restructuring and refinancing of our credit facilities, including the termination of our domestic off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program. Credit Sources We had available committed and uncommitted credit facilities totaling $7.30 billion at December 31, 2004, of which $1.12 billion were unused, compared to $5.90 billion and $335.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. U.S. Deposit Funded Credit Facility On August 18, 2004, we refinanced our then existing $680 million U.S. revolving credit facility with a U.S. deposit funded credit facility, which is a synthetic revolving credit and letter of credit facility. Pursuant to the refinancing, the lenders deposited the entire $680 million of the facility in an account held by the administrative agent, and those funds are used to support letters of credit or borrowings on a revolving basis, in each case subject to customary conditions. The lenders under the new facility will receive annual compensation on the amount of the facility equivalent to 450 basis points over LIBOR, which includes commitment fees on the entire amount of the commitment (whether drawn or undrawn) and a usage fee on the amounts drawn. 54 Table of Contents The full amount of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit or for revolving loans. The $500.7 million of letters of credit that were outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2004 were transferred to the deposit funded credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the facility and $509.9 million of letters of credit issued under the facility. The facility matures on September 30, 2007. Our obligations under the deposit funded credit facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and by our wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Goodyear Canada Inc. Our obligations under this facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by collateral that includes: subject to certain exceptions, perfected first priority security interests in the equity interests in our U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests in our non European foreign subsidiaries; a perfected second priority security interest in 65% of the capital stock of Goodyear Finance Holding S.A., a Luxembourg company; perfected first priority security interests in and mortgages on our U.S. corporate headquarters and certain of our U.S. manufacturing facilities; perfected third priority security interests in all accounts receivable, inventory, cash and cash accounts pledged as security under our asset based facilities; and perfected first priority security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets, including equipment, contract rights and intellectual property. The bond agreement for our Swiss franc bonds due 2006 limits our ability to use our U.S. tire and automotive parts manufacturing facilities as collateral for secured debt without triggering a requirement that holders of the bonds be secured on an equal and ratable basis. The manufacturing facilities indicated above were pledged to ratably secure the bonds to the extent required by the bond agreement. However, the aggregate amount of our debt secured by these manufacturing facilities is limited to 15% of our positive consolidated shareholders equity. Consequently, the security interests granted to the lenders under the U.S. senior secured funded credit facility are not required to be shared with the holders of debt outstanding under our other existing unsecured bond indentures. The deposit funded credit facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional unsecured and secured indebtedness (including a limit, subject to certain exceptions, of 275 million in accounts receivable transactions), make investments and sell assets beyond specified limits. The facility prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock. We must also maintain a minimum consolidated net worth (as such term is defined in the deposit funded credit facility) of at least $2.0 billion for quarters ending in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, and $1.75 billion for each quarter thereafter through September 30, 2007. We are not permitted to allow the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to fall below a ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. In addition, our ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA is not permitted to be greater than 4.00 to 1.00 at any time. The deposit funded credit facility also limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make to $500 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and $375 million in 2007 (through September 30, 2007). The amounts of permitted capital expenditures may be increased by the amount of net proceeds retained by us from permitted asset sales and equity and debt issuances. In addition, unused capital expenditures may be carried over into the next year. As a result of certain activities, the capital expenditure limit for 2004 was increased from $500 million to approximately $1.10 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2004 totaled $518.6 million. The capital expenditure carryover from 2004 was $603.0 million, and in the absence of any other transactions, the limit for 2005 will be $1.10 billion. 55 Table of Contents $1.95 Billion Senior Secured Asset Based Credit Facilities In April 2003, we entered into senior secured asset based credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.30 billion, consisting of a $500 million revolving credit facility and an $800 million term loan facility. At December 31, 2004, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $800 million drawn against the term loan asset based facility, compared to $389.0 million and $800.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. The facilities mature on March 31, 2006. On February 20, 2004, we added a $650 million term loan tranche to the existing $1.30 billion facility, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2004. The $650 million tranche was used partially to prepay our U.S. term loan facility, to repay other indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes. The facilities mature on March 31, 2006. We pay an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the revolving facility. Loans under the facilities (other than the $650 million term loan tranche) bear interest at LIBOR plus 400 basis points or an alternative base rate (the higher of JPMorgans prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points) plus 300 basis points. The $650 million term loan tranche bears interest at LIBOR plus 450 basis points or an alternative base rate plus 350 basis points. The basis points on the $650 million term loan tranche decrease to 425 and 325 points, respectively, if the ratings of the tranche improve to at least B1 or better from Moodys and B+ or better from Standard & Poors. A borrowing base (equal to the sum of a percentage of certain accounts receivable and inventory) limits availability under the facilities (other than the $650 million term loan tranche). The calculation of the borrowing base and reserves against inventory and accounts receivable included in the borrowing base are subject to adjustment from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders in their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Adjustments would be based on the results of ongoing collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. A $50 million availability block further limits availability under the facilities. If at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings under the facilities (other than $650 million term loan tranche) exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings sufficient to eliminate the excess or maintain compensating deposits with the agent bank. The facilities are collateralized by first and second priority security interests in all accounts receivable and inventory of Goodyear and its domestic and Canadian subsidiaries (excluding accounts receivable and inventory related to our North American joint venture with SRI). In addition, effective as of February 20, 2004, collateral included second and third priority security interests on the other assets securing the U.S. facilities. The facilities contain certain representations, warranties and covenants which are materially the same as those in the U.S. facilities, with capital expenditures of $500 million and $150 million permitted in 2005 and 2006 (through March 31), respectively. In addition, we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of at least $2.0 billion for quarters ending in 2005 and 2006 (through March 31, 2006). Consolidated EBITDA Under our primary credit facilities, we are not permitted to allow the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to fall below 2.00 to 1.00 (as such terms are defined in each of the primary credit facilities) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. In addition, our ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in each of the restructured credit facilities) is not permitted to be greater than 4.00 to 1.00 at any time. Consolidated EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure of our ability to service debt. It should not be construed as an alternative to either (i) income before income taxes, or (ii) cash flows from operating activities. Our failure to comply with the financial covenants in the primary credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. Accordingly, management believes that the presentation of Consolidated EBITDA will provide investors with information needed to assess our ability to continue to comply with these covenants. The following table presents the calculation of EBITDA and Consolidated EBITDA for the periods indicated. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do. Certain line items are presented as defined in the primary credit facilities, and do not reflect amounts as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 56 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Restated 2004 2003 2002 (In millions) Net Income (Loss) $ 114.8 $ (807.4 ) $ (1,246.9 ) Consolidated Interest Expense 378.8 314.6 270.8 U.S. and Foreign Taxes on Income 207.9 117.1 1,227.9 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 628.7 691.6 605.3 EBITDA 1,330.2 315.9 857.1 Credit Agreement Adjustments: Other (Income) and Expense (13.1 ) 287.4 4.7 Foreign Currency Exchange 23.4 40.7 (8.7 ) Equity in (Earnings) Losses of Affiliates (8.4 ) 14.5 13.8 Minority Interest in Net Income (Loss) of Subsidiaries 57.8 32.8 55.6 Non cash Extraordinary Gains Non cash Non recurring Items 54.7 Rationalizations 55.6 291.5 5.5 Less Excess Cash Rationalization Charges (1) (12.9 ) Consolidated EBITDA $ 1,445.5 $ 1,024.6 $ 928.0 (1) Excess Cash Rationalization Charges is defined in our April 1, 2003 credit facilities and only contemplates cash expenditures with respect to rationalization charges recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Income after April 1, 2003. Amounts incurred prior to April 1, 2003 were not included. $650 Million Senior Secured European Facilities Our joint venture in Europe, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. and subsidiaries (GDTE) is party to a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $400 million senior secured term loan facility. These facilities mature on April 30, 2005. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the secured term loan facility was fully drawn. Each of these facilities was fully drawn at December 31, 2003. GDTE pays an annual commitment fee of 75 basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the European revolving facility. GDTE may obtain loans under the European facilities bearing interest at LIBOR plus 400 basis points or an alternative base rate (the higher of JPMorgans prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points) plus 300 basis points. The collateral pledged under the European facilities includes: all of the capital stock of Goodyear Finance Holding S.A. and certain subsidiaries of GDTE, a perfected first priority interest in and mortgages on substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of GDTE in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany, including certain accounts receivable, inventory, real property, equipment, contract rights and cash and cash accounts, but excluding certain accounts receivable used in securitization programs, and with respect to the European revolving credit facility, a perfected fourth priority interest in and mortgages on the collateral pledged under the deposit funded credit facility and the asset based facilities, except for real estate other than our U.S. corporate headquarters. 57 Table of Contents Consistent with the covenants applicable to Goodyear in the U.S. facilities, the European facilities contain certain representations, warranties and covenants applicable to GDTE and its subsidiaries which, among other things, limit GDTEs ability to: incur additional indebtedness (including a limit of 275 million in accounts receivable transactions), make investments, sell assets beyond specified limits, pay dividends, and make loans or advances to Goodyear companies that are not subsidiaries of GDTE. The European facilities also contain certain additional covenants identical to those in the U.S. facilities. The European facilities also limit the amount of capital expenditures that GDTE may make to $250 million in 2004 and $100 million in 2005 (through April 30, 2005). Subject to the provisions in the European facilities and agreements with our joint venture partner, Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. (SRI), GDTE is permitted to transfer funds to Goodyear. These provisions and agreements include limitations on loans and advances from GDTE to Goodyear and a requirement that transactions with affiliates be consistent with past practices or on arms length terms. Any amount outstanding under the term facility is required to be prepaid with: 75% of the net cash proceeds of all sales and dispositions of assets by GDTE and its subsidiaries greater than $5 million, and 50% of the net cash proceeds of debt and equity issuances by GDTE and its subsidiaries. The U.S. and European facilities can be used, if necessary, to fund ordinary course of business needs, to repay maturing debt, and for other needs as they arise. Other Foreign Credit Facilities At December 31, 2004, we had short term committed and uncommitted bank credit arrangements totaling $338.9 million, of which $181.5 million were unused, compared to $347.0 million and $209.4 million at December 31, 2003. The continued availability of these arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender, and a portion of these arrangements may be terminated at any time. International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities On Balance Sheet Financing On December 10, 2004, GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new five year pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. The facility initially provides 165 million of funding, but has the ability to be expanded to 275 million, and will be subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity lines. The new facility replaces an 82.5 million facility in a subsidiary in France. The new facility involves the twice monthly sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retained servicing responsibilities. It is an event of default under the facility if: the ratio of our Consolidated EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense falls below 2.00 to 1.00, the ratio of our consolidated senior secured indebtedness to our Consolidated EBITDA is greater than 4.00 to 1.00, the ratio of GDTEs third party indebtedness (net of cash held by GDTE and its consolidated subsidiaries in excess of $100 million) to its Consolidated EBITDA is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, or for so long as such a provision is in our European credit facilities, our consolidated net worth is less than $2 billion on or prior to March 31, 2006, or is less than $1.75 billion after March 31, 2006, in each case subject to a 60 day grace period. 58 Table of Contents The financial covenants listed above will be automatically amended to conform to the European Credit Facilities upon the refinancing of the European Credit Facilities. The defined terms used in the events of default tests are similar to those in the European Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2004, net cash inflows of $224.7 million were recorded, representing the amount outstanding and fully utilized under this program. The program did not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly, this amount is included in consolidated long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net cash outflows of $113.1 million were recorded in 2004 related to the termination of the replaced European accounts receivable securitization programs. In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, SPT and other subsidiaries in Australia had transferred accounts receivable under other programs totaling $63.2 million and $7.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities Off Balance Sheet Financing Various other international subsidiaries have also established accounts receivable continuous sales programs. At December 31, 2004, proceeds available to these subsidiaries from the sale of certain of their receivables totaled $4.7 million. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. $650 Million Senior Secured Notes On March 12, 2004, we completed a private offering of $650 million of senior secured notes, consisting of $450 million of 11% senior secured notes due 2011 and $200 million of floating rate notes due 2011, which accrue interest at LIBOR plus 8%. The proceeds of the notes were used to prepay the remaining outstanding amount under the then existing U.S. term loan facility, permanently reduce commitments under the then existing revolving credit facility by $70 million, and for general corporate purposes. The U.S. term facility had been scheduled to mature in April 2005. Loans under the retired term facility and the revolving credit facility each bore interest at LIBOR plus 4%. The notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the U.S. deposit funded credit facility and asset based credit facilities. The notes are secured by perfected fourth priority liens on the same collateral securing those facilities (pari passu with the liens on that domestic collateral securing the parent guarantees of the European revolving credit facility). We have the right to redeem the fixed rate notes in whole or in part from time to time on and after March 1, 2008. The redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, would be 105.5%, 102.75%, and 100.0% on and after March 1, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We may also redeem the fixed rate notes prior to March 1, 2008 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium. We have the right to redeem the floating rate notes in whole or in part from time to time on and after March 1, 2008. The redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, would be 104.0%, 102.0%, and 100.0% on and after March 1, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In addition, prior to March 1, 2007, we have the right to redeem up to 35% of the fixed and floating rate notes with net cash proceeds from one or more public equity offerings. The redemption price would be 111% for the fixed rate notes and 100% plus the then applicable floating rate for the floating rate notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture for the senior secured notes contains restrictions on our operations, including limitations on: incurring additional indebtedness or liens, paying dividends, making distributions and stock repurchases, making investments, selling assets, and merging and consolidating. The deposit funded credit facility also limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make to $500 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and $375 million in 2007 (through September 30, 2007). The amounts 59 Table of Contents of permitted capital expenditures may be increased by the amount of net proceeds retained by us from permitted asset sales and equity and debt issuances. In addition, unused capital expenditures may be carried over into the next year. As a result of certain activities, the capital expenditure limit for 2004 was increased from $500 million to approximately $1.10 billion. Our capital expenditures for 2004 totaled $518.6 million. The capital expenditure carryover from 2004 was $603.0 million, and in the absence of any other transactions, the limit for 2005 will be $1.10 billion. In the event that the senior secured notes have a rating equal to or greater than Baa3 from Moodys and BBB from Standard and Poors, a number of those restrictions will not apply, for so long as those credit ratings are maintained. $350 Million Convertible Note Offering On July 2, 2004, we completed an offering of $350 million of 4.00% convertible senior notes due June 15, 2034. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock initially at a conversion rate of 83.07 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of $12.04 per share. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay temporarily a revolving credit facility and for working capital purposes. $645 Million Senior Secured U.S. Term Facility At March 12, 2004, all outstanding amounts under the facility were prepaid and the facility was retired. At December 31, 2003, the balance due on the U.S. term facility was $583.3 million, due to a partial pay down of the balance during the second quarter of 2003. $680 Million Senior Secured U.S. Revolving Credit Facility At August 18, 2004, all outstanding amounts under the facility were prepaid and the facility was retired. In addition, $500.7 million of letters of credit issued under the facility were transferred to our $680 million senior secured deposit funded credit facility. Registration Obligations We are a party to two registration rights agreements in connection with our private placement of $350 million of convertible notes in July 2004 and $650 million of senior secured notes in March 2004. The registration rights agreement for the convertible notes requires us to pay additional interest to investors if we do not file a registration statement to register the convertible notes by November 7, 2004, or if such registration statement is not declared effective by the SEC by December 31, 2004. The additional interest to investors is at a rate of 0.25% per year for the first 90 days and 0.50% per year thereafter. We failed to file a registration statement for the convertible notes by November 7, 2004, and as a result, will pay additional interest until such time as a registration statement is filed and declared effective. The registration rights agreement for the senior secured notes requires us to pay additional interest to investors if a registered exchange offer for the notes is not completed by December 7, 2004. The additional interest to investors is at a rate of 1.00% per year for the first 90 days, increasing in increments of 0.25% every 90 days thereafter, to a maximum of 2.00% per year. Because no such exchange offer was completed by December 7, 2004, we will pay additional interest until an exchange offer is completed. If the rate of additional interest payable reaches 2.00% per year then the interest rate for the secured notes will be permanently increased by 0.25% per annum after the exchange offer is completed. 60 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of the date of this report are presented below: S&P Moodys Senior Secured Asset Based Facilities BB B1 European Facilities B+ B1 $650 Million Asset Based Tranche B B2 $650 Million Senior Secured Notes due 2011 * B3 Corporate Rating B+ B1 (implied) Senior Unsecured Debt B B3 * Private rating Although we do not request ratings from Fitch, the rating agency rates our secured debt facilities B and our unsecured debt CCC+. As a result of these ratings and other related events, we believe that our access to capital markets may be limited. Unless our debt credit ratings and operating performance improve, our access to the credit markets in the future may be limited. Moreover, a further reduction in our credit ratings would further increase the cost of any financing initiatives we may pursue. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency, and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Turnaround Strategy We are currently implementing a turnaround strategy for North American Tire that will require us to: stabilize margins and market shares, simplify the sales and supply chain process, execute key cost cutting strategies, implement brand and distribution strategies, and grow the business through new product introductions and new sales channels. Our ability to successfully implement the cost cutting strategy is also dependent upon our ability to lower costs and increase productivity from levels achieved under the terms of our master contract with the USWA ratified in 2003. Based in part on success in implementing the turnaround strategy, North American Tire had stronger operating results in 2004 than in 2003. However, additional progress in implementing the turnaround strategy is needed to achieve a satisfactory level of profitability in North American Tire. If the goals of the turnaround strategy are not met, we will not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations and otherwise negatively affect our operations. There is no assurance that we will successfully implement this turnaround strategy. In particular, this strategy and our liquidity could be adversely affected by trends that affected the North American Tire segment negatively in prior years, including: industry overcapacity which limits pricing leverage, weakness in the replacement tire market, increased competition from low cost manufacturers and a related decline in our market share, weak U.S. economic conditions, and increases in medical and pension costs. 61 Table of Contents In addition, the turnaround strategy has been, and may continue to be, impacted negatively by higher raw material and energy costs. During 2004, the market price of natural rubber, one of our most important raw materials, oil, an important feedstock for several other raw materials, increased significantly versus the prior year. Based on a combination of our inventory turns and raw material shipment lead times, market price fluctuations in raw materials typically impact our CGS three to six months subsequent to the raw material purchase date. Furthermore, market conditions may prevent us from passing these increases on to our customers through timely price increases. We retained The Blackstone Group L.P. and Bain & Company to provide consulting advice on the turnaround strategy and other possible strategic initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Future Liquidity Requirements At December 31, 2004, we had $1.97 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.02 billion was held in the United States and $415.6 million was in accounts of GDTE. The remaining amounts were held in our other non U.S. operations. Our ability to move cash and cash equivalents among our various operating locations is subject to the operating needs of the operating locations as well as restrictions imposed by local laws and applicable credit facility agreements. At December 31, 2004, approximately $219.9 million of cash was held in locations where significant tax or legal impediments would make it difficult or costly to execute monetary transfers. Unused availability under our various credit agreements totaled approximately $1.12 billion at December 31, 2004. Based upon our projected operating results, we expect that cash flow from operations, together with amounts available under our primary credit facilities and other sources of liquidity, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements through December 31, 2005 (including working capital, debt service, pension funding and capital expenditures). The aggregate amount of long term debt maturing in calendar years 2005 and 2006 is approximately $1.01 billion and $1.92 billion, respectively. Included in the amount for 2005 is $400.0 million related to our primary European credit facilities maturing on April 30, 2005 and our 400 million 6.375% Euro Notes due June 2005 (equivalent to approximately $542 million at December 31, 2004). In March 2006, $1.45 billion related to our asset based facilities matures, and the $250 million 65/8% Senior Notes are due in December 2006. On February 23, 2005 we announced that we intend to refinance approximately $3.3 billion of our credit facilities, including: our $1.3 billion asset based credit facility, due March 31, 2006, our $650 million asset based term loan, due March 31, 2006, our $680 million deposit funded credit facility, due September 30, 2007, and $650 million in credit facilities for our Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. affiliate, due April 30, 2005. We expect to replace these facilities with $3.35 billion in new five year facilities that will be due in 2010 and include: a $1.5 billion asset based credit facility, a $1.2 billion second lien term loan, and the Euro equivalent of $650 million in credit facilities for Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. These transactions are subject to market conditions and the execution of definitive documentation and are expected to close in April 2005. We expect to record pretax charges of approximately $40 million for the write off of unamortized costs related to the replaced facilities, and the costs of refinancing could be significant. Failure to refinance the European credit facilities or asset based facilities before they mature could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity. In order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed, we plan to seek additional financing in the capital markets. Because of our debt ratings, operating performance over the past few years and other factors, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. Our 62 Table of Contents ongoing ability to access the capital markets is also dependent on the degree of success we have implementing our North American Tire turnaround strategy. Successful implementation of the turnaround strategy is also crucial to ensuring that we have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations. While we made progress in implementing the turnaround strategy in 2004, there is no assurance that our progress will continue, or that we will be able to sustain any future progress to a degree sufficient to maintain access to capital markets and meet liquidity requirements. As a result, failure to complete the turnaround strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Future liquidity requirements also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets is already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, unless we sustain or improve our financial performance, our ability to raise unsecured debt may be limited. In addition to maturing debt, we are required to make contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plans. These contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Although subject to change, we expect to be required by ERISA to make contributions to our domestic pension plans of approximately $400 million to $425 million in 2005. At the end of 2005, the current interest rate relief measures used for pension funding calculations expire. If current measures are extended, we estimate that required contributions in 2006 will be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. If new legislation is not enacted, the interest rate used for 2006 and beyond will be based upon a 30 year U.S. Treasury bond rate, as calculated and published by the U.S. government as a proxy for the rate that could be attained if 30 year Treasury bonds were currently being issued. Using an estimate of these rates would result in estimated required contributions during 2006 in the range of $725 million to $775 million. The assumptions used to develop these estimates are described in the Commitments and Contingencies table below. We are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond 2006. Nevertheless, we expect that the amount of contributions required in years beyond 2006 will be substantial. In 2005, in addition to required domestic plan contributions, we expect to contribute approximately $70 million to our funded international pension plans. Our postretirement benefit plans will require amounts to cover benefit payments in the future. Benefit payments are expected to be approximately $304 million in 2005, $321 million in 2006 and $274 million in 2007. These estimates are based upon the plan provisions currently in effect. Total payments are estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion as calculated on December 31, 2004. The majority of these payments would be made more than five years hence. The estimated payments do not include an estimated reduction in our obligations totaling approximately $475 million to $525 million resulting from the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, Ansell Ltd., our joint venture partner in South Pacific Tyres (SPT), has the right, subject to certain conditions, during the period beginning August 2005 and ending one year later, to require Goodyear to purchase Ansells 50% interest in SPT. The purchase price is a formula price based on the earnings of SPT, subject to various adjustments. If Ansell does not exercise its right, we may require Ansell to sell its interest to us during the 180 days following the expiration of Ansells right at a price established using the same formula. We are subject to various legal proceedings, including those described in the Note to the Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. In the event we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any proceeding, we would be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we do not have sufficient availability under our facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond, we may be required to (i) pay down borrowings under the facility in order to increase the amount available for issuing letters of credit, or (ii) deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal. A significant deposit of cash collateral may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. A substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, our debt service obligations would increase. A significant rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity in future periods. 63 Table of Contents Dividends On February 4, 2003, we announced that we eliminated our quarterly cash dividend. The dividend reduction was decided on by the Board of Directors in order to conserve cash. Under our primary credit agreements, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2004: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2004 After Total 1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year 4th Year 5th Year 5 Years (In millions) Long Term Debt (1) $ 5,619.2 $ 1,225.2 $ 1,920.6 $ 300.8 $ 104.0 $ 227.4 $ 1,841.2 Capital Lease Obligations (2) 91.1 10.4 9.5 9.0 8.9 8.5 44.8 Interest Payments (3) 1,761.4 348.1 229.8 160.1 150.3 162.6 710.5 Operating Leases (4) 1,519.3 320.3 262.6 203.1 146.8 110.5 476.0 Pension Benefits (5) 1,232.5 482.5 750.0 (5) (5) (5) (5) Other Post Retirement Benefits (6) 2,624.5 303.9 320.7 273.7 266.5 260.3 1,199.4 Workers Compensation (7) 285.9 66.0 42.4 29.3 20.3 25.4 102.5 Binding Commitments (8) 755.9 705.6 16.1 5.2 4.0 3.9 21.1 $ 13,889.8 $ 3,462.0 $ 3,551.7 $ 981.2 $ 700.8 $ 798.6 $ 4,395.5 (1) Long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of December 31, 2004. (2) The present value of capital lease obligations is $60.4 million. (3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Payments related to variable debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2004 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. (4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $52.2 million, $42.9 million, $34.2 million, $25.6 million, $17.0 million, and $32.0 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $203.9 million. Net operating lease payments total $1,315.4 million, with a present value of $946.0 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, computers and office equipment, real estate and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2004. The amounts set forth in the table represent our estimated minimum funding requirements in 2005 and 2006 for domestic defined pension plans under ERISA, and $70 million of expected contributions to our funded international pension plans in 2005. Although subject to change, we expect to be required by ERISA to make contributions to our domestic pension plans of approximately $400 to $425 million in 2005. The amount in the table for 2005 represents the midpoint of this range plus expected contributions to our funded international plans. The expected contributions are based upon a number of assumptions, including: an ERISA liability interest rate of 6.10% for 2005, and plan asset returns of 8.5% in 2005. At the end of 2005, the current interest relief rate measures used for pension funding calculations expire. If current measures are extended, we estimate that required contributions in 2006 will be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. If new legislation is not enacted, the interest rate used for 2006 and beyond 64 Table of Contents will be based upon a 30 year U.S. Treasury bond rate, as calculated and published by the U.S. government as a proxy for the rate that could be attained if 30 year Treasury bonds were currently being issued. Using an estimate of these rates would result in estimated required contributions during 2006 in the range of $725 million to $775 million. The estimated amount set forth in the table for 2006 represents the mid point of this range. We likely will be subject to additional statutory minimum funding requirements after 2006. We are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond 2006 due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, including: interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, what, if any, changes may occur in legislation, and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions. We expect the amount of contributions required in years beyond 2006 will be substantial. (6) The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the plans at any time. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments do not include an estimated reduction in our obligations totaling approximately $475 million to $525 million resulting from the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. (7) The payments for workers compensation are based upon recent historical payment patterns. The present value of anticipated payments for workers compensation is $230.7 million. (8) Binding commitments are for our normal operations and are related primarily to obligations to acquire land, buildings and equipment. In addition, binding commitments includes obligations to purchase raw materials through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We have recorded long term liabilities for other items including income taxes, general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, they are not included in the above table. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which can not be estimated, are not included in the above table: The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI as set forth in the Umbrella Agreement between Goodyear and SRI provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI commencing in 2009. In addition, the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the Umbrella Agreement, including certain bankruptcy events or changes in control of Goodyear, could trigger a right of SRI to require us to purchase these interests immediately. SRIs exit rights, in the unlikely event of exercise, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire Sumitomos interest in the alliance. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, Ansell Ltd., our joint venture partner in South Pacific Tyres (SPT), has the right, subject to certain conditions, during the period beginning August 2005 and ending one year later, to require us to purchase Ansells 50% interest in SPT. The purchase price is a formula price based on the earnings of SPT, subject to various adjustments. If Ansell does not exercise its right, we may require Ansell to sell its interest to us during the 180 days following the expiration of Ansells right at a price established using the same formula. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 2001, we are required to purchase minimum amounts of carbon black from a certain supplier from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2006, at agreed upon 65 Table of Contents base prices. The base prices are subject to quarterly adjustments for changes in raw material costs and natural gas costs and a one time adjustment for other manufacturing costs. We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We will, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees, as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total 1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year 4th Year 5th Year Thereafter (In millions) Customer Financing Guarantees $ 7.5 $ 2.4 $ 1.4 $ 1.1 $ 0.5 $ 1.0 $ 1.1 Affiliate Financing Guarantees 9.8 4.9 4.9 Other Guarantees 0.9 0.1 0.6 0.2 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements $ 18.2 $ 2.4 $ 6.3 $ 6.0 $ 0.6 $ 1.6 $ 1.3 For further information about guarantees, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingencies. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps. We will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates, and are normally designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions. At December 31, 2004, the interest rates on 50% of our debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts, compared to 47% at December 31, 2003. We also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances. As a result of credit ratings actions and other related events, our access to these instruments may be limited. 66 Table of Contents The following table presents information on interest rate swap contracts at December 31: 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions) Fixed Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ $ 325.0 Pay fixed rate 5.00 % Receive variable LIBOR 1.17 Average years to maturity 0.25 Fair value liability $ $ (3.1 ) Pro forma fair value liability (3.1 ) Floating Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 200.0 $ 200.0 Pay variable LIBOR 4.31 % 2.96 % Receive fixed rate 6.63 6.63 Average years to maturity 1.95 2.95 Fair value asset $ 6.0 $ 13.0 Pro forma fair value asset 5.3 12.3 The pro forma fair value assumes a 10% increase in variable market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. Weighted average interest rate swap contract information follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in millions) Fixed Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 81.0 $ 325.0 $ 325.0 Pay fixed rate 5.00 % 5.00 % 5.00 % Receive variable LIBOR 1.18 1.24 1.91 Floating Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ 200.0 $ 207.0 $ 210.0 Pay variable LIBOR 3.27 % 3.03 % 3.68 % Receive fixed rate 6.63 6.63 6.63 The following table presents fixed rate debt information at December 31: 2004 2003 (In billions) Carrying amount liability $ 3.05 $ 2.23 Fair value liability 3.22 2.11 Pro forma fair value liability 3.30 2.18 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis. The model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment 67 Table of Contents acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales. In addition, the principal and interest on our Swiss franc bonds due 2006 and 100 million of the Euro Notes due 2005 are hedged by currency swap agreements. Contracts hedging the Swiss franc bonds and the Euro Notes are designated as cash flow hedges. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency contract information at December 31: 2004 2003 (In millions) Fair value asset (liability) $102.0 $ 71.7 Pro forma change in fair value (22.3 ) (22.0 ) Contract maturities 1/05 10/19 1/04 10/19 We were not a party to any foreign currency option contracts at December 31, 2004 or 2003. The pro forma change in fair value assumes a 10% change in foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models. Fair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 as follows: 2004 2003 (In millions) Asset (liability): Swiss franc swap current $ (0.3 ) $ (1.6 ) Swiss franc swap long term 59.5 46.8 Euro swaps current 46.4 20.5 Euro swaps long term 13.2 Other current asset 5.2 7.2 Other current (liability) (8.8 ) (14.4 ) For further information on interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts, refer to the Note to the Financial Statements No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 68 Table of Contents
