ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 64 manufacturing facilities in 25 countries, including the United States. In 2007, we operated our business through five operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: North American Tire; European Union Tire; Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire; Latin American Tire; and Asia Pacific Tire. As a result of our sale of substantially all of our Engineered Products business, we have reported the results of that segment as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relate to continuing operations. We have been implementing strategies to drive top line growth, reduce costs, improve our capital structure and focus on core businesses where we can achieve profitable growth. During 2007, we continued to make progress in implementing these strategies through the following accomplishments: Our recovery from the fourth quarter 2006 USW strike was faster and less costly than anticipated, We continued to make progress on our four point cost savings plan, We have taken significant steps in the VEBA approval process, We announced significant changes to our U.S. based retail and salaried employees pension and retiree benefit plans, and We completed our Capital Structure Improvement Plan. Consolidated Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2007, we had net income of $602 million compared to a net loss of $330 million in 2006. We recorded income from continuing operations in 2007 of $139 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $373 million in 2006. In addition, our total segment operating income for 2007 was $1,230 million compared to $712 million in 2006. See Result of Operations Segment Information for additional information. Operating income improved in 2007 by approximately $279 million as a result of returning to normal sales and production levels following the USW strike, which negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2006 and part of the first quarter of 2007. The impact of the strike in 2007 was less than originally anticipated primarily due to North American Tires ability to ramp up production faster than expected and to emphasize production of higher margin replacement tires. Our 2007 results were impacted favorably by price and product mix improvements and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by decreased volumes, primarily due to the USW strike and our decision to exit certain segments of the private label tire business, higher raw material costs, and increased selling, administrative and general expense. Four Point Cost Savings Plan We have announced a four point cost savings plan which includes continuous improvement programs, reducing high cost manufacturing capacity, leveraging our global position by increasing low cost country sourcing, and reducing selling, administrative and general expense. We expect to achieve between $1.8 billion and $2 billion of aggregate gross cost savings from 2006 through 2009. The expected cost reductions consist of: from $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion of estimated savings related to continuous improvement initiatives, including safety programs, business process improvements, such as six sigma and lean manufacturing, and product reformulations, and ongoing savings that we expect to achieve from our master labor agreement with the USW (through December 31, 2007, we estimate we have achieved over $700 million in savings under these initiatives); 27 Table of Contents over $150 million of estimated savings from the reduction of high cost manufacturing capacity by over 25 million units (we estimate that announced reductions to date will result in approximately $135 million of savings when complete); between $200 million to $300 million of estimated savings related to our sourcing strategy of increasing our procurement of tires, raw materials, capital equipment and indirect materials from low cost countries (through December 31, 2007, we estimate we have achieved nearly $100 million in savings under this strategy); from $200 million to $250 million of estimated savings from reductions in selling, administrative and general expense related to initiatives including benefit plan changes, back office and warehouse consolidations and headcount reductions (through December 31, 2007, we estimate we have achieved more than $175 million in savings under these efforts). Execution of our four point cost savings plan and realization of the projected savings is critical to our success. Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association During the fourth quarter of 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio preliminarily approved the settlement agreement filed by the USW, the retiree class representatives and Goodyear that would result in the establishment of the VEBA and set the date for a hearing regarding the settlement agreement. Following that hearing, the District Court will determine whether to grant final approval of the settlement agreement. The savings we expect to achieve from the VEBA are included in our anticipated continuous improvement savings described above under Four Point Cost Savings Plan. Pension and Benefit Plan Changes In February 2007, we announced various changes to our U.S. based retail and salaried employee pension and retiree benefit plans. These changes will be phased in over a two year period, with most benefit plan changes effective in 2008 and the most significant pension plan changes effective in 2009. As a result of the changes, we achieved after tax savings of $91 million in 2007, and expect to achieve after tax savings of $100 million to $110 million in 2008, and $80 million to $90 million in 2009 and beyond. The ongoing savings are included in our targeted savings from continuous improvement initiatives and reductions in selling, administrative and general expense described above under Four Point Cost Savings Plan. We recorded a curtailment charge of $64 million related to these actions in the first quarter of 2007. Capital Structure Improvement Plan In April 2007, we completed a refinancing of three of our primary credit facilities, which extended maturities, reduced applicable interest rates and provides us with a more flexible covenant package. In May 2007, we completed a public equity offering of 26.1 million shares of common stock at a price of $33.00 per share, raising $862 million before offering costs. We used a portion of the $833 million net proceeds from the equity offering to exercise our rights to redeem $175 million of our $500 million 8.625% senior notes due 2011 and $140 million of our $400 million 9% senior notes due in 2015. In July 2007, we completed the sale of our Engineered Products business for $1.475 billion, which marked the completion of our Capital Structure Improvement Plan that we began in 2003. We recognized an after tax gain on the sale of our Engineered Products business of $508 million, or $2.19 per share, which is reported in discontinued operations. In addition, during the third quarter of 2007, we repaid our $300 million third lien secured term loan due 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 4% convertible senior notes due 2034 for a cash payment and shares of our common stock. The exchange offer resulted in the issuance of 28.7 million shares of common stock, a total cash payment, including accrued and unpaid interest, of $23 million, and a reduction of debt of $346 million. On February 1, 2008, we issued notices of redemption to the holders of our $650 million senior secured notes due 2011. That redemption will occur on March 3, 2008. 28 Table of Contents New Products At our North American dealer conference in early February 2008 we continued our transformation to a market driven, consumer focused company with the introduction of the Goodyear Assurance and the Eagle GT tires. The Assurance is a mid tier passenger tire and joins the brands two premium offerings in that segment: Assurance ComforTred and Assurance TripleTred. It is targeted at the everyday consumer and designed to deliver enhanced traction and responsive handling. The new Eagle GT is positioned within the Goodyear Eagle Performance Tire family as a mid tier entry, complementing the brands three premium ultra high performance offerings, including the Eagle F1 GS D3, the Eagle F1 All Season, and the Eagle F1 Asymmetric. We expect to introduce additional new tires in key market segments in 2008. Industry Volume Estimates Our 2008 industry volume estimates for our two largest regions are as follows: In North America we estimate consumer OE volume will be down 2% to 4%, and commercial OE volume will be up 20% to 30% reflecting a recovery in demand following weak 2007 industry volumes which were driven by regulations regarding new commercial vehicle emission standards. North American consumer and commercial replacement volumes are both expected to be flat to up 2%. In Europe, consumer OE volume is expected to be up 2% to 4%, and commercial OE volume is expected to be up 5% to 10%. We expect consumer replacement volume to be flat to up 1% and commercial replacement volume to be up 1% to 2%. Our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or the OE industry, which would result in lower levels of plant utilization and an increase in unit costs. Also, we could experience higher raw material and energy costs in future periods. These costs, if incurred, may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in todays highly competitive market and we may not be able to continue improving our product mix. Our future results of operations are also dependent on our ability to successfully implement our cost reduction programs and address increasing competition from low cost manufacturers. We are unable to predict future currency fluctuations. Sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens against various foreign currencies, or if economic conditions deteriorate in the economies in which we operate. Continued volatile economic conditions or changes in government policies in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods. For additional factors that may impact our business and results of operations please see Risk Factors at page 13. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED (All per share amounts are diluted) 2007 Compared to 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2007, we had net income of $602 million, or $2.65 per share, compared to a net loss of $330 million, or $1.86 per share, in the comparable period of 2006. Income from continuing operations in 2007 was $139 million, or $0.65 per share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $373 million, or $2.11 per share, in 2006. Net Sales Net sales in 2007 were $19.6 billion, increasing $893 million, or 5% compared to 2006. Net sales in 2007 were impacted favorably by price and product mix of $880 million and favorable currency translation of $833 million, primarily in European Union Tire. These increases were partially offset by decreased volume of $784 million, net of $216 million of higher sales volume in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the USW strike. The decrease in volume is primarily attributable to North American Tire, due to our June 2006 decision to exit the certain segments of the private label tire business, in addition to lower sales from other tire related businesses of $32 million. 29 Table of Contents The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, (In millions of tires) 2007 2006 % Change Replacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 55.7 61.6 (9.6 )% International 86.2 90.4 (4.7 )% Total 141.9 152.0 (6.7 )% OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 25.6 29.3 (12.6 )% International 34.2 33.7 1.3 % Total 59.8 63.0 (5.1 )% Goodyear worldwide tire units 201.7 215.0 (6.2 )% The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 13.3 million units, or 6.2% compared to 2006 is primarily driven by a decrease of 10.1 million units, or 6.7%, in replacement units, primarily in North American Tire and European Union Tire. North American Tire consumer replacement volume decreased 6.0 million units, or 10.3% due to a strategic share reduction in the lower value segment following our decision to exit certain segments of the private label tire business, partially offset by increased share of our higher value branded products. European Union Tire consumer replacement volume decreased 4.4 million units, or 9.9% compared to 2006, which was primarily market and strategy driven. The decrease in replacement volume was partially offset by an increase in Eastern Europe Tire replacement volume of 0.8 million units or 4.5%. OE units sales in 2007 decreased by 3.2 million units, or 5.1%, due primarily to decreases in North American Tire, driven by lower vehicle production, and Eastern Europe Tire, due to the exit of non profitable business. This decrease in OE unit sales was partially offset by increases in Latin America Tire and European Union Tire. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was $15.9 billion in 2007, an increase of $184 million, or 1% compared to the 2006 period. CGS decreased to 81.0% of sales in 2007 compared to 83.9% in 2006. CGS increased in 2007 due to higher foreign currency translation of $606 million, product mix related cost increases of $241 million, primarily related to North America Tire and European Union Tire, higher raw material costs of $195 million, and increased conversion costs of $94 million. Also increasing CGS were increased research and development expenses of $30 million, a curtailment charge of $27 million related to the benefit plan changes announced in the first quarter of 2007, and increased costs of approximately $25 million related to production inefficiencies and a strike in South Africa. Partially offsetting these increases was lower volume of $883 million, primarily related to North American Tire, higher savings from restructuring plans of $49 million, lower accelerated depreciation of $46 million, and decreased costs related to other tire related businesses of $39 million. 2006 was also affected by a pension plan curtailment gain of $13 million and $29 million related to favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers. In addition, the net impact of the USW strike increased volume and product mix by approximately $125 million, and decreased conversion costs and costs related to other tire related businesses by approximately $180 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) was $2.8 billion in 2007, an increase of $216 million or 8%. SAG in 2007 was 14.1% of sales, compared to 13.6% in 2006. The increase was driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $111 million, a curtailment charge of $37 million related to the benefit plan changes announced in the first quarter of 2007, and higher incentive stock compensation expense of $33 million. Also unfavorably impacting SAG were higher advertising expenses of $24 million, primarily in the North American and Asia Pacific Tire Segments, increased general and product liability expenses of $14 million, increased consulting and contract labor expenses of $9 million, and higher bad debt expenses of approximately $6 million, primarily in 30 Table of Contents European Union Tire. These increases were partially offset by decreases in employee benefit costs of $26 million, primarily related to North American Tire, and higher savings from restructuring plans of $16 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $450 million, an increase of $3 million during 2007 as compared to 2006. Interest expense in 2007 was adversely impacted by higher debt levels incurred during the USW strike, but was favorably affected by a reduction in outstanding debt following the end of the strike and the early retirement of various debt obligations during 2007. Interest expense in 2008 is expected to decline relative to 2007 due primarily to lower average debt levels. Other (Income) and Expense Other (income) and expense was $1 million of income in 2007, a decrease of $86 million compared to $87 million of income in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to higher financing fees of $66 million primarily relating to our redemption of $315 million of long term debt, our exchange offer for our outstanding 4% convertible senior notes and our refinancing activities in April 2007. In addition, we incurred higher losses of $33 million on foreign currency exchange in 2007 primarily as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar versus the euro, Chilean peso and Brazilian real. Other income was also unfavorably impacted by lower net gains on asset sales of approximately $25 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a loss of $36 million ($35 million net of minority interest) on the sale of substantially all of the assets of North American Tires tire and wheel assembly operation in the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2007 there was a fire in our Thailand facility, which resulted in a loss of $12 million, net of insurance proceeds. The decrease in other income was partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately $42 million due primarily to higher cash balances in 2007. In addition, other income was favorably impacted by a decrease of approximately $11 million in expenses related to general and product liabilities, including asbestos and Entran II claims. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other (Income) and Expense. Income Taxes For 2007, we recorded tax expense of $255 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of $464 million. For 2006, we recorded tax expense of $60 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of $202 million. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed below. Income tax expense in 2007 includes a net tax benefit totaling $6 million, which consists of a tax benefit of $11 million ($0.04 per share) related to prior periods offset by a $5 million charge primarily related to recently enacted tax law changes. The out of period adjustment related to our correction of the inflation adjustment on equity of our subsidiary in Colombia as a permanent tax benefit rather than as a temporary tax benefit dating back as far as 1992, with no individual year being significantly affected. Income tax expense in 2006 included net favorable tax adjustments totaling $163 million. The adjustments for 2006 related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position regarding a reorganization of certain legal entities in 2001, which was partially offset by a charge of $47 million to establish a foreign valuation allowance, attributable to a rationalization plan. Our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in these foreign locations. However, it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all, or a portion, of these valuation allowances within the next 12 months will exist, resulting in one time tax benefits of up to $70 million ($60 million net of minority interest). For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 14, Income Taxes. 31 Table of Contents Rationalizations To maintain global competitiveness, we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years to reduce excess and high cost manufacturing capacity and to reduce associate headcount. We recorded net rationalization costs of $49 million in 2007 and $311 million in 2006. 2007 Rationalization actions in 2007 consisted primarily of a decision to reduce tire production at two facilities in Amiens, France in our European Union Tire Segment. These actions are expected to be implemented in the second half of 2008 and will involve a reduction of up to 500 associates and the reduction of certain high cost production. Other rationalization actions in 2007 related to plans to reduce manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions in several segments. During 2007, net rationalization charges of $49 million ($41 million after tax or $0.17 per share) were recorded. New charges of $63 million were comprised of $28 million for plans initiated in 2007, primarily related to associate severance costs, and $35 million for plans initiated in 2006, consisting of $9 million for associate severance costs and $26 million for other exit and non cancelable lease costs. The net charges in 2007 also included the reversal of $14 million of charges for actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. Approximately 600 associates will be released under programs initiated in 2007, of which approximately 100 were released by December 31, 2007. In 2007, $45 million was incurred for associate severance payments, and $39 million was incurred for non cancelable lease and other exit costs. In addition to the above charges, accelerated depreciation charges of $37 million were recorded in CGS in 2007, primarily for fixed assets taken out of service in connection with the elimination of tire production at our Tyler, Texas and Valleyfield, Quebec facilities in our North American Tire Segment. General Upon completion of the 2007 plans, we estimate that annual operating costs will be reduced by approximately $28 million ($22 million CGS and $6 million SAG). The savings realized in 2007 for the 2007 plans totaled approximately $7 million ($4 million CGS and $3 million SAG). In addition, savings realized in 2007 for the 2006 plans totaled approximately $122 million ($80 million CGS and $42 million SAG) compared to our estimate of $205 million. 2007 savings related to 2006 rationalization activities is less than the prior year estimate primarily due to the Tyler plant closure not occurring in 2007 as planned, the discontinuation of tire production at Valleyfield not realizing a full year of savings, and plan changes and implementation delays. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. 2006 Rationalization actions in 2006 consisted of plant closures in the European Union Tire Segment of a passenger tire manufacturing facility in Washington, United Kingdom, and in the Asia Pacific Tire Segment of the Upper Hutt, New Zealand passenger tire manufacturing facility. Charges were also incurred for a plan in North American Tire to cease tire manufacturing at our Tyler, Texas facility, which was substantially complete in December 2007, and a plan in Eastern Europe Tire to close our tire manufacturing facility in Casablanca, Morocco, which was completed in the first quarter of 2007. Charges were also recorded for a partial plant closure in the North American Tire Segment involving a plan to discontinue tire production at our Valleyfield, Quebec facility, which was completed by the second quarter of 2007. In conjunction with these charges we also recorded a $47 million tax valuation allowance. Other plans in 2006 included an action in the Eastern Europe Tire Segment to exit the bicycle tire and tube production line in Debica, Poland, retail store closures in the European Union Tire and Eastern Europe Tire Segments as well as plans in most segments to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions, all of which were substantially completed. 32 Table of Contents For 2006, $311 million ($328 million after tax or $1.85 per share) of net charges were recorded. New charges of $322 million are comprised of $315 million for plans initiated in 2006 and $7 million for plans initiated in 2005 for associate related costs. The $315 million of charges for 2006 plans consisted of $286 million of associate related costs, of which $159 million related to associate severance costs and $127 million related to non cash pension and postretirement benefit costs, and $29 million of non cancelable lease costs. The net charges in 2006 also included reversals of $11 million for actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. Approximately 4,800 associates will be released under programs initiated in 2006, of which approximately 3,900 were released by December 31, 2007. In 2006, $98 million was incurred for associate severance payments, $127 million for non cash pension and postretirement termination benefit costs, and $21 million for non cancelable lease and other exit costs. In addition to the above charges, accelerated depreciation charges of $81 million and asset impairment charges of $2 million were recorded in CGS related to fixed assets that will be taken out of service primarily in connection with the Washington, Casablanca, Upper Hutt, and Tyler plant closures. We also recorded charges of $2 million of accelerated depreciation and $3 million of asset impairment in SAG. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations had income of $463 million, or $2.00 per share, in 2007 compared to income of $43 million, or $0.25 per share, in 2006, representing an increase of $420 million. The increase in 2007 is primarily due to a gain of $508 million on the sale of our Engineered Products business. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Discontinued Operations. 2006 Compared to 2005 For the year ended December 31, 2006, we had a net loss of $330 million, or $1.86 per share, compared to net income of $228 million, or $1.16 per share, in the comparable period of 2005. Loss from continuing operations in 2006 was $373 million, or $2.11 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $124 million, or $0.66 per share, in 2005. Net income in 2005 included a net loss from the cumulative effect of an accounting change totaling $11 million, or $0.05 per share. Net Sales Net sales in 2006 were $18.8 billion, increasing $653 million, or 4% compared to 2005. Net sales in 2006 for our tire segments were impacted favorably by price and product mix by approximately $1,067 million, increased sales from our other tire related businesses of $407 million, primarily in North American Tire, and favorable currency translation of $200 million, primarily in European Union Tire. Partially offsetting these were lower volume of $405 million, primarily in North American Tire, $318 million of lower sales as a result of the USW strike, and $265 million of sales related to 2005 North American Tire divestitures. 33 Table of Contents The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, (In millions of tires) 2006 2005 % Change Replacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 61.6 71.2 (13.4 )% International 90.4 90.8 (0.5 )% Total 152.0 162.0 (6.2 )% OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 29.3 30.7 (4.8 )% International 33.7 33.7 0.3 % Total 63.0 64.4 (2.2 )% Goodyear worldwide tire units 215.0 226.4 (5.0 )% Worldwide replacement unit sales in 2006 decreased from 2005 due primarily to an overall decline in the consumer replacement market as well as a strategic share reduction in the lower value segment in North American Tire. OE unit sales in 2006 decreased from 2005 due primarily to North American Tire, driven by lower vehicle production, and European Union Tire due to our selective fitment strategy and a weak OE consumer market, offset by increased unit sales in Latin American Tire due to increased market share. The USW strike also decreased units by 2.8 million. Cost of Goods Sold CGS was $15.7 billion in 2006, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 8% compared to the 2005 period. CGS increased to 83.9% of sales in 2006 compared to 80.3% in 2005. CGS for our tire segments in 2006 increased due to higher raw material costs of $829 million, and $369 million of increased costs related to other tire related businesses. Product mix related manufacturing cost increases of $321 million, primarily related to North American Tire and European Union Tire, $212 million of higher conversion costs mainly in North American Tire, and foreign currency translation of $115 million, primarily related to European Union Tire also increased CGS. Also increasing CGS was $83 million of accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges, primarily related to the closure of the Washington, United Kingdom; Upper Hutt, New Zealand; and Casablanca, Morocco facilities and the elimination of tire production at our Tyler, Texas facility. Partially offsetting these increases were lower volume of $360 million, primarily related to North American Tire, divestitures in 2005 of $227 million, lower depreciation expense of $31 million as a result of the increased estimated useful lives of our tire mold equipment, and $29 million as a result of a favorable settlement with a raw material supplier. Also reducing CGS was savings from rationalization plans of $21 million and a pension plan curtailment gain in Brazil of $13 million. The USW strike decreased volume and product mix by $229 million, and increased conversion costs and costs related to other tire related businesses by $222 million. Also included in 2005 costs were $21 million of hurricane related expenses. Selling, Administrative and General Expense SAG was $2.5 billion in 2006, a decrease of $88 million or 3%. SAG in 2006 was 13.6% of sales, compared to 14.6% in 2005. The decrease in our tire segments was driven primarily by lower advertising expenses of $49 million, primarily in the European Union and North American Tire Segments, savings from rationalization programs of $22 million, and lower wage and benefit expenses of $30 million, partially offset by stock based compensation expense of $26 million. Also 2005 included approximately $10 million of costs related to hurricanes. These decreases were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $22 million, higher general and product liability expenses of $15 million, primarily in North American Tire, and $5 million of accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges primarily related to a plant closure in Morocco. Also increasing SAG was approximately $2 million related to the impact of the USW strike. 34 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense was $447 million, an increase of $39 million during 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in 2006 average debt levels due to financing arrangements entered into partly as a result of the USW strike. Other (Income) and Expense Other (income) and expense was $87 million of income in 2006, an increase of $149 million compared to $62 million of expense in 2005. The increase in income was primarily due to lower amortization of commitment fees and other debt related costs of $69 million, and increased interest income of $28 million from short term investments of the additional cash balances resulting from increased borrowings. In 2006 there were gains of $21 million and $9 million, respectively, from the sale of a capital lease in the European Union and the Fabric business, compared to a net loss of $49 million in 2005 from the sale of the Farm Tire and Wingtack businesses. 2006 also included the reversal of a liability of $13 million in Brazil subsequent to a favorable court ruling. These gains were partially offset by approximately $17 million in additional expenses related to general and product liabilities, primarily related to asbestos claims, and a decline of $42 million in net insurance settlement gains. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other (Income) and Expense. Income Taxes For 2006, we recorded tax expense of $60 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of $202 million. For 2005, we recorded tax expense of $233 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries of $452 million. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the net favorable adjustments discussed below. Income tax expense in 2006 and 2005 includes net favorable tax adjustments totaling $163 million and $25 million, respectively. The adjustments for 2006 related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position regarding a reorganization of certain legal entities in 2001, which was partially offset by a charge of $47 million to establish a foreign valuation allowance, attributable to a rationalization plan. The favorable adjustment for 2005 related primarily to the release of certain foreign valuation allowances. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 14, Income Taxes. Rationalizations To maintain global competitiveness, we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years for the purpose of reducing excess and high cost manufacturing capacity and to reduce associate headcount. We recorded net rationalization costs of $311 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005. 2006 Rationalization actions in 2006 consisted of plant closures in the European Union Tire Segment of a passenger tire manufacturing facility in Washington, United Kingdom, and in the Asia Pacific Tire Segment of the Upper Hutt, New Zealand passenger tire manufacturing facility. Charges were also incurred for a plan in North American Tire to cease tire manufacturing at our Tyler, Texas facility, which was substantially complete in December 2007, and a plan in Eastern Europe Tire to close our tire manufacturing facility in Casablanca, Morocco, which was completed in the first quarter of 2007. Charges were also recorded for a partial plant closure in the North American Tire Segment involving a plan to discontinue tire production at our Valleyfield, Quebec facility, which was completed by the second quarter of 2007. In conjunction with these charges we also recorded a $47 million tax valuation allowance. Other plans in 2006 included an action in the Eastern Europe Tire Segment to exit the bicycle tire and tube production line in Debica, Poland, retail store closures in the European Union Tire and Eastern Europe Tire Segments as well as plans in most segments to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions, all of which were substantially completed. 35 Table of Contents For 2006, $311 million ($328 million after tax or $1.85 per share) of net charges were recorded. New charges of $322 million are comprised of $315 million for plans initiated in 2006 and $7 million for plans initiated in 2005 for associate related costs. The $315 million of charges for 2006 plans consisted of $286 million of associate related costs, of which $159 million related to associate severance costs and $127 million related to non cash pension and postretirement benefit costs, and $29 million of non cancelable lease costs. The net charges in 2006 also included reversals of $11 million for actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. Approximately 4,800 associates will be released under programs initiated in 2006, of which approximately 3,900 were released by December 31, 2007. In 2006, $98 million was incurred for associate severance payments, $127 million for non cash pension and postretirement termination benefit costs, and $21 million for non cancelable lease and other exit costs. In addition to the above charges, accelerated depreciation charges of $81 million and asset impairment charges of $2 million were recorded in CGS related to fixed assets that will be taken out of service primarily in connection with the Washington, Casablanca, Upper Hutt, and Tyler plant closures. We also recorded charges of $2 million of accelerated depreciation and $3 million of asset impairment in SAG. 2005 Rationalization charges in 2005 consisted of manufacturing associate reductions, retail store reductions, IT associate reductions, and a sales function reorganization in European Union Tire; manufacturing and administrative associate reductions in Eastern Europe Tire; and manufacturing and corporate support group associate reductions in North American Tire, all of which were substantially completed. For 2005, $7 million ($2 million after tax or $0.00 per share) of net charges were recorded, which included $24 million of charges recorded in 2005, of which $22 million were for associate related costs for new plans initiated in 2005 and $2 million for plans initiated in prior years. These charges were partially offset by $17 million of reversals for rationalization charges no longer needed for their originally intended purposes. The reversals consisted of $10 million of associate related costs for plans initiated in prior years, and $7 million for non cancelable leases that were exited during the first quarter related to plans initiated in prior years. Approximately 740 associates have been released under the programs initiated in 2005 as of December 31, 2007. In 2005, $33 million was incurred for associate severance payments, $1 million for cash pension settlement benefit costs and $7 million for non cancelable lease costs. Discontinued Operations Income in 2006 decreased $72 million compared to 2005 due primarily to the negative impact of the USW strike of approximately $48 million, increased raw material costs of $40 million, and lower volume of $18 million. Partially offsetting these were favorable price and product mix of $39 million, $16 million in favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers, $1 million in lower SAG, and lower conversion costs of approximately $4 million. In addition, currency translation of $3 million and $2 million related to a pension plan curtailment gain in Brazil, favorably impacted operating income. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies what criteria must be met prior to recognizing the financial statement benefit of a position taken in a tax return and requires companies to include additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to such positions within their financial statements. The disclosures include potential tax benefits from positions taken for tax return purposes that have not been recognized for financial reporting purposes and a tabular presentation of significant changes during each period. The disclosures also include a discussion of the nature of uncertainties, factors which could cause a change, and an estimated range of reasonably possible changes in tax uncertainties. FIN 48 also requires a company to recognize a financial statement benefit for a position taken for tax return purposes when it will be more likely than not that the position will be sustained. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption resulted in 36 Table of Contents an increase in the opening balance of retained earnings and a decrease in goodwill of $32 million and $5 million, respectively, for tax benefits not previously recognized under historical practice. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition and disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS No. 157 will require the fair value of an asset or liability to be based on market based measures which will reflect the credit risk of the company. SFAS No. 157 will also expand disclosure requirements to include the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits a company to choose to measure many financial instruments and other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing a company with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. A company will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date on items for which the fair value option has been elected. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 effective January 1, 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141 (R)), replacing SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No. 141, broadens its scope by applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, and requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, that liabilities related to contingent consideration be recognized at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value in each subsequent reporting period, that acquisition related costs be expensed as incurred, and that income be recognized if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests (i.e., minority interests) in a subsidiary, including changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires, among other things, that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be classified as a separate component of equity. Except for the presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 160, which are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented, SFAS No. 141 (R) and SFAS No. 160 are to be applied prospectively in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are assessing the impact SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to: general and product liability and other litigation, workers compensation, recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions, and pensions and other postretirement benefits. 37 Table of Contents General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos 1) in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past, or 2) in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts. We engage an independent asbestos valuation firm, Bates White, LLC (Bates), to review our existing reserves for pending asbestos claims, provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries related to such claims. A significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $127 million at December 31, 2007. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was $76 million. At December 31, 2007, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities could exceed our recorded reserve by $20 to $30 million, approximately 50% of which would be recoverable by our accessible policy limits. We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration relevant factors, including ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers, their financial viability, their legal obligations and other pertinent facts. Bates also assists us in valuing receivables to be recorded for probable insurance recoveries. Based upon the model employed by Bates, as of December 31, 2007, (i) we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $71 million, and (ii) we expect that approximately 50% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable up to our accessible policy limits. The receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Of this amount, $8 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts receivable at December 31, 2007. In addition to asbestos claims, we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our Entran II rubber hose product. During 2004, we entered into a settlement agreement to address a substantial portion of our Entran II liabilities. The claims associated with the plaintiffs that opted not to participate in the settlement are evaluated in a manner consistent with our other litigation claims. We had recorded liabilities related to Entran II claims of $193 million at December 31, 2007. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $276 million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation claims at December 31, 2007. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return. 38 Table of Contents For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingencies. Recoverability of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Rather, these assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be allocated to various reporting units, which are either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below the operating segment. We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments as determined under SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Our reporting units for purposes of applying the provisions of SFAS No. 142 are comprised of five strategic business units: North American Tire, European Union Tire, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, Latin American Tire, and Asia Pacific Tire. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units. During 2007, there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated. For purposes of our annual impairment testing, which is conducted as of July 31 each year, we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of comparable companies. The EBITDA multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions. The EBITDA of the reporting units are based on a combination of historical and forecasted results and are adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges. Significant decreases in EBITDA in future periods may be an indication of a potential impairment. Additionally, valuation multiples of comparable companies would have to decline in excess of 40% to indicate a potential goodwill impairment. Goodwill was $713 million and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were $122 million at December 31, 2007. Our annual impairment analysis for 2007 indicated no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives. In addition, there were no events or circumstances that indicated the impairment test should be re performed at December 31, 2007. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2007, we had a valuation allowance aggregating $2.2 billion against all of our net Federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in the U.S. and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal, state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets under No. SFAS 109. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be required. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 14, Income Taxes. 39 Table of Contents Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including: life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation levels, future health care costs, and maximum company covered benefit costs. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher by Standard Poors as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. The total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over periods of 15 years or more, asset class return expectations and long term inflation. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected. The discount rates used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans were 6.25% and 6.00%, respectively, at December 31, 2007, compared to 5.75% at December 31, 2006 and 5.50% at December 31, 2005 for both our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans. The increase in the discount rate at December 31, 2007 was due primarily to higher interest rates on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $306 million in 2007, compared to $295 million in 2006 and $294 million in 2005. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $109 million in 2007, compared to $133 million in 2006 and $147 million in 2005. Interest cost was lower in 2007 as a result of the reduction in the postretirement liability due to plan amendments and actuarial gains. The weighted average amortization period for employees covered by our U.S. plans is approximately 20 years. The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement obligation, shareholders equity, and 2008 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: +/ Change at December 31, 2007 (Dollars in millions) Change PBO/ABO Equity 2008 Expense Pensions: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5 % $ 261 $ 261 $ 15 Actual return on assets +/ 1.0 % N/A 42 7 Estimated return on assets +/ 1.0 % N/A N/A 44 Other Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5 % $ 54 $ 54 $ 2 Health care cost trends total cost +/ 1.0 % 3 3 Although we experienced an increase in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2007, a large portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss of $936 million in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2007 is a result of the 40 Table of Contents overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining our 2007 U.S. net periodic pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $56 million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in 2007. We will recognize approximately $39 million of unrecognized actuarial losses in 2008. Given no change to the assumptions at our December 31, 2007 measurement, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2008 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 8.1%, 14.0% and 8.5% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 8.5% for all three years. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for substantially all of our pension plans. The service cost of our U.S. pension plans was $84 million, $91 million, and $50 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2005 expense reflects the suspension of pension service credit agreed to in our 2003 labor contract. This suspension expired on November 1, 2005. Although we experienced an increase in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2007, a large portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss of $92 million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2007 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. The unrecognized actuarial loss decreased from 2006 primarily due to the increase in the discount rate at December 31, 2007. For purposes of determining 2007 worldwide net periodic postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $8 million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in 2007. We will recognize approximately $7 million of unrecognized actuarial losses in 2008. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2007, actuarial loss recognition will gradually decline from the 2008 levels. For further information on pensions and other postretirement benefits, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 13, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit and Savings Plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects our strategic business units (SBUs), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. Our segments are managed on a regional basis. Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Segment operating income includes transfers to other SBUs. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding accelerated depreciation charges and asset impairment charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items. Segment assets include those assets under the management of the SBU. Total segment operating income was $1.2 billion in 2007, $712 million in 2006 and $1.1 billion in 2005. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2007 was 6.3%, compared to 3.8% in 2006 and 5.9% in 2005. Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 16, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes and Minority Interest. North American Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Tire Units 81.3 90.9 101.9 Net Sales $ 8,862 $ 9,089 $ 9,091 Operating (Loss) Income 139 (233 ) 167 Operating Margin 1.6 % (2.6 )% 1.8 % 41 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 North American Tire unit sales in 2007 decreased 9.6 million units or 10.5% from 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in replacement unit sales of 5.9 million units or 9.6% due to a strategic share reduction in the lower value segment, following our decision to exit certain segments of the private label tire business, partially offset by increased share of our higher value branded products. In addition, OE volume in 2007 decreased 3.7 million units or 12.6% in our consumer and commercial businesses as a result of lower vehicle production. Net sales in 2007 decreased $227 million or 2.5% from 2006. The decrease was driven by a decline in volume of $739 million primarily due to exiting certain segments of the private label tire business in addition to decreased OE volume in our consumer and commercial businesses as a result of lower vehicle production. Sales in other tire related businesses also decreased approximately $66 million. Partially offsetting these were favorable price and product mix of $338 and favorable foreign currency translation of $24 million. In addition, net sales in 2007 were $216 million higher compared to 2006 as a result of the USW strike. Operating income in 2007 was $139 million compared to an operating loss in 2006 of $233 million, an increase of $372 million. Operating income improved in 2007 by approximately $279 million as a result of returning to normal sales and production levels following the USW strike, which negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2006 and part of the first quarter of 2007. Operating income in 2007 was also favorably impacted by price and product mix of $235 million, increased operating income in other tire related businesses of $27 million, and lower conversion costs of $19 million. Conversion costs were driven by lower employee benefit expenses partially offset by unabsorbed fixed costs due to lower production volume, training of new workers and plant changeovers. This performance was partially offset by increased raw material costs of $97 million, decreased sales volume of $65 million, and higher SAG costs of approximately $11 million. Also, included in 2006 was $21 million of favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers. Operating income in 2007 did not include $35 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the elimination of tire production at our Tyler, Texas and Valleyfield, Quebec facilities. Operating income in 2006 did not include $14 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the elimination of tire production at our Tyler, Texas facility. Operating income also did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $11 million in 2007 and $187 million in 2006 and (gains) losses on asset sales of $17 million in 2007 and $(11) million in 2006. 2006 Compared to 2005 North American Tire unit sales in 2006 decreased 11.0 million units or 10.8% from 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in replacement unit sales of 9.6 million units or 13.4% due to an overall market decline in the consumer replacement market as well as further strategic share reduction in the lower value segment, following our decision to exit the wholesale private label tire business, partially offset by increased share of our higher value branded products. Also, OE volume in 2006 decreased 1.4 million units or 4.8% from 2005 driven by lower vehicle production. Included in the volume decrease was 1.1 million units due to the Farm Tire divestiture and approximately 2.8 million units as a result of the USW strike. Net sales in 2006 decreased $2 million from 2005. Net sales in 2006 decreased $386 million due primarily to lower volume from the weak consumer replacement market and exiting the wholesale private label tire business, approximately $318 million due to the unfavorable impact of the USW strike and approximately $265 million from divestitures in 2005. Partially offsetting these were favorable price and mix of $543 million due to price increases to offset higher raw material costs and improved mix resulting from our strategy to focus on the higher value consumer replacement market and greater selectivity in the consumer OE market. Also, positively impacting sales in the period was growth in other tire related businesses of $393 million, as well as currency translation of approximately $31 million. Operating loss in 2006 was $233 million compared to operating income in 2005 of $167 million, a decrease of $400 million. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by increased raw material costs of $373 million, increased costs of $313 million as a result of the USW strike, increased conversion costs of $135 million, primarily driven by lower volume and higher energy costs, lower volume of $45 million and approximately $34 million of income related to divested businesses. Partially offsetting these were favorable price and product mix of 42 Table of Contents $367 million, and lower SAG costs of $55 million, which includes lower wages and benefits of $20 million, approximately $17 million of lower advertising expenses, and $9 million of savings from rationalization plans, partially offset by $15 million in increased general and product liability expenses. In addition, $21 million of favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers, increased operating income in chemical and other tire related businesses of $22 million, and approximately $15 million of lower depreciation expense as a result of the increased estimated useful lives of our tire mold equipment favorably impacted operating income. In 2005, approximately $25 million of costs were incurred associated with the hurricanes. Operating income in 2006 did not include $14 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the elimination of tire production at our Tyler, Texas facility. Operating income also did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $187 million in 2006 and $(8) million in 2005 and (gains) losses on asset sales of $(11) million in 2006 and $43 million in 2005. European Union Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Tire Units 59.4 63.5 64.3 Net Sales $ 5,393 $ 4,990 $ 4,676 Operating Income 302 286 317 Operating Margin 5.6 % 5.7 % 6.8 % 2007 Compared to 2006 European Union Tire Segment unit sales in 2007 decreased 4.1 million units or 6.5% from 2006. Replacement volume decreased 4.4 million units or 9.6%, mainly in consumer replacement which was primarily market and strategy driven, while OE volume increased 0.3 million units or 1.6%. Net sales in 2007 increased $403 million or 8.1% from 2006. Favorably impacting sales was foreign currency translation of $449 million, and improved price and product mix of $287 million. Lower volume of $288 million and lower sales in the other tire related businesses of approximately $50 million unfavorably impacted net sales. Operating income in 2007 increased $16 million or 5.6% compared to 2006 due to improvement in price and mix of $175 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $26 million. These were offset in part by lower volume of $61 million, higher raw material costs of $51 million, and lower operating income from other tire related businesses of $24 million. In addition, increased research and development expenses of $22 million, and increased conversion costs of $18 million also had an unfavorable impact on operating income in 2007. Operating income in 2006 also included $6 million in favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers. Operating income in 2007 and 2006 did not include $2 million and $50 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of the Washington, UK facility. Operating income also did not include net rationalization charges totaling $24 million in 2007 and $64 million in 2006 and gains on asset sales of $20 million in 2007 and $27 million in 2006. European Union Tires results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 44% and 43% of European Union Tires net sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Germany will have a significant impact on European Union Tires future performance. 2006 Compared to 2005 European Union Tire Segment unit sales in 2006 decreased 0.8 million units or 1.2% from 2005. OE volume decreased 0.8 million units or 4.1% due to a selective OE fitment strategy and a weak OE consumer market. Net sales in 2006 increased $314 million or 6.7% from 2005. The increase was due primarily to price and product mix of $246 million, driven by price increases to offset higher raw material costs and a favorable mix in the consumer replacement and commercial markets. Also favorably impacting sales was currency translation totaling 43 Table of Contents $109 million. This improvement was partially offset by the lower volume of $48 million, primarily due to decreased consumer OE sales. Operating income in 2006 decreased $31 million or 9.8% compared to 2005 due to higher raw material costs of $224 million, increased conversion costs of $25 million and lower volume of $12 million. Partially offsetting these were improvements in price and product mix of $136 million, driven by price increases to offset higher raw material costs and the continued shift towards high performance and ultra high performance tires, lower SAG expenses of $69 million, primarily due to lower advertising and wages and benefits, and lower research and development of approximately $5 million. Also, lower depreciation expense of $10 million as a result of the increased estimated useful lives of our tire mold equipment, favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers of $6 million, and favorable currency translation of $6 million favorably impacted operating income. Operating income in 2006 did not include $50 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of the Washington, UK facility. Operating income also did not include net rationalization charges totaling $64 million in 2006 and $8 million in 2005 and gains on asset sales of $27 million in 2006 and $5 million in 2005. Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Tire Units 20.2 20.0 19.7 Net Sales $ 1,824 $ 1,562 $ 1,437 Operating Income 280 229 198 Operating Margin 15.4 % 14.7 % 13.8 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2007 increased 0.2 million units or 0.8% from 2006 primarily related to increased replacement unit sales of 0.8 million or 4.5% as a result of market growth in certain countries. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in OE units sales of 0.6 million units or 16.1% due primarily to the exit of non profitable businesses. Net sales in 2007 increased by $262 million, or 16.8% compared to 2006 due to price increases and favorable product mix due to continued growth of high performance tires and premium brands of $112 million. Net sales were also favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of $93 million, improved sales in other tire related businesses of $48 million, and increased volume of approximately $10 million. Operating income in 2007 increased by $51 million, or 22.3% from 2006. Operating income in 2007 was favorably impacted by price and product mix of $101 million, improvements in the other tire related businesses of $12 million, and favorable foreign currency translation of $4 million. Negatively impacting operating income were increased costs of approximately $25 million related to a strike and production inefficiencies in South Africa, higher conversion costs of $15 million, higher SAG expenses of $21 million, primarily due to higher advertising and compensation costs, and increases in warranty and research and development expenses totaling $4 million. Operating income did not include net rationalization charges totaling $9 million in 2007 and $30 million in 2006. Operating income in 2006 also did not include accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs of $12 million and net gains on asset sales of $1 million. 2006 Compared to 2005 Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2006 increased 0.3 million units or 1.5% from 2005 primarily related to increased replacement unit sales of 0.6 million or 3.6% primarily due to growth in certain countries. OE units sales decreased 0.3 million units or 7.1% due primarily to the exit of non profitable businesses. Net sales in 2006 increased by $125 million, or 8.7% compared to 2005 mainly due to price increases to recover higher raw material costs and favorable product mix due to continued growth of high performance tires and premium brands of approximately $106 million, increased volume of $19 million, mainly in Central Europe and 44 Table of Contents Russia, as well as improved other sales, mainly South African retail sales of approximately $9 million. These were offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $10 million. Operating income in 2006 increased by $31 million, or 15.7% from 2005. Operating income in 2006 was favorably impacted by price and product mix of $73 million due to factors described above, favorable foreign currency translation of $10 million, and improved volume of approximately $6 million primarily in emerging markets. Also favorably impacting operating income was lower SAG expenses of $10 million due to a decrease in marketing expenses, and improvement in other tire related businesses of $5 million. Negatively impacting operating income were higher raw material costs of $61 million, and higher conversion costs of $16 million primarily due to increased energy costs. Operating income did not include accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs of $12 million in 2006 related to the closure of the Morocco facility. Operating income also did not include net rationalization charges totaling $30 million in 2006 and $9 million in 2005 and net (gains) losses on asset sales of $(1) million in 2006 and $1 million in 2005. Latin American Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Tire Units 21.8 21.2 20.4 Net Sales $ 1,872 $ 1,607 $ 1,471 Operating Income 359 326 294 Operating Margin 19.2 % 20.3 % 20.0 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2007 increased 0.6 million units or 2.9% compared to 2006. OE volume increased 0.8 million units or 12.0% as a result of improving market conditions, offset by a decline in replacement units of 0.2 million units or 1.0%. Net sales in 2007 increased $265 million, or 16.5% compared to 2006. Net sales increased in 2007 due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil, of approximately $123 million, favorable price and product mix of $73 million, and increased volume of $43 million. Also increasing net sales was higher sales of other tire related businesses of approximately $29 million. Operating income in 2007 increased $33 million, or 10.1% compared to 2006. Operating income was favorably impacted by $74 million from the impact of currency translation, $60 million due to improved price and product mix, and $11 million due to increased volume. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher raw material costs of $41 million and higher conversion costs of $32 million. Lower operating income in other tire related businesses of $11 million and higher SAG expenses of $8 million also had an unfavorable impact on operating income in 2007. In addition, included in 2006 was a pension plan curtailment gain of $17 million. Operating income did not include net rationalization charges totaling $2 million in both 2007 and 2006. Operating income also did not include gains on asset sales of $1 million in 2007 and 2006. In addition, operating income in 2006 did not include a gain of $13 million resulting from the favorable resolution of a legal matter in Brazil. Latin American Tires results are highly dependent upon Brazil, which accounted for approximately 49% and 46% of Latin American Tires net sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Brazil will have a significant impact on Latin American Tires future performance. 2006 Compared to 2005 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2006 increased 0.8 million units or 3.6% compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in OE volume of 0.9 million units or 17.1%. OE volume increased due to new business and increased market share. Replacement units decreased 0.1 million units or 1.2%. 45 Table of Contents Net sales in 2006 increased $136 million, or 9.2% compared to 2005. Net sales increased in 2006 due to the favorable impact of currency translation, mainly in Brazil, of approximately $63 million, increased volume of $47 million, and favorable price and product mix of $60 million. Operating income in 2006 increased $32 million, or 10.9% compared to 2005. Operating income was favorably impacted by $46 million from the favorable impact of currency translation, approximately $60 million due to improved price and product mix, a pension plan curtailment gain of $17 million, and $14 million due to increased volume. Increased raw material costs of $96 million and higher conversion costs of $10 million, negatively impacted operating income compared to 2005. Operating income did not include net rationalization charges totaling $2 million in 2006. In addition, operating income did not include gains on asset sales of $1 million in 2006 and 2005. Asia Pacific Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Tire Units 19.0 19.4 20.1 Net Sales $ 1,693 $ 1,503 $ 1,423 Operating Income 150 104 84 Operating Margin 8.9 % 6.9 % 5.9 % 2007 Compared to 2006 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2007 decreased 0.4 million units or 2.1% compared to 2006. Replacement units decreased 0.4 million units or 3.1% driven by reduced participation in low margin segments of the market and reduced production volume resulting from the Thailand fire. Net sales in 2007 increased $190 million or 12.6% from 2006 due to favorable foreign currency translation of $144 million and favorable price and product mix of $70 million. Partially offsetting these increases was lower volume of approximately $26 million. Operating income in 2007 increased $46 million or 44.2% from 2006 primarily due to improved price and product mix of $67 million and $8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. These were offset in part by higher SAG expenses of $11 million primarily related to increased advertising costs, lower sales volume of $5 million, and increased conversion costs of $5 million related to lower production volume as a result of the Thailand fire. Higher raw material prices of $4 million and increased research and development costs of $4 million also had an unfavorable impact on operating income. In addition, operating income in 2006 included approximately $2 million in favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers. Operating income did not include net rationalization charges totaling $1 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2006 and gains on assets sales of $8 million in 2007 and $2 million in 2006. Operating income in 2007 also did not include a $12 million loss, net of insurance proceeds, as a result of the Thailand fire. In addition, operating income in 2006 did not include approximately $12 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Upper Hutt, New Zealand facility. Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 46% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2007 and 2006. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. 2006 Compared to 2005 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2006 decreased 0.7 million units or 3.3% compared to 2005. OE volume increased 0.1 million units or 3.0% mainly due to improvements in the Chinese and Indian OE markets. Replacement units decreased 0.8 million units or 6.1% driven by reduced participation in low margin segments of the market, as well as, increased low cost import competition in several countries within the region. 46 Table of Contents Net sales in 2006 increased $80 million or 5.6% from 2005 due to favorable price and product mix of $112 million, and to favorable currency translation of $7 million. Partially offsetting these increases was lower volume of $37 million. Operating income in 2006 increased $20 million or 23.8% from 2005 primarily due to improved price and product mix of $110 million, and approximately $2 million in favorable settlements with certain raw material suppliers. These were offset in part by raw material cost increases of $75 million, decreased volume of $8 million, decreased income in our Asian joint ventures of $6 million, and increased conversion costs of approximately $5 million due to lower production volume. Operating income in 2006 did not include $12 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Upper Hutt, New Zealand facility. Operating income also did not include net rationalization charges (credits) totaling $28 million in 2006 and $(2) million in 2005 and gains on asset sales of $2 million in 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2007, we had $3,463 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $2,169 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $3,862 million and $533 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to $2.3 billion of repayments on our borrowings, including $1.3 billion under our U.S. and European revolving credit facilities and European term loans, $300 million of 81/2% senior notes due 2007, the $315 million debt redemption in the second quarter of 2007, and the prepayment of the $300 million third lien term loan in the third quarter of 2007. The decrease was offset in part by cash received from the sale of our Engineered Products business of $1,475 million and our public equity offering which raised $833 million. Cash and cash equivalents do not include restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily consists of our contributions made related to the settlement of the Entran II litigation and proceeds received pursuant to insurance settlements. In addition, we will, from time to time, maintain balances on deposit at various financial institutions as collateral for borrowings incurred by various subsidiaries, as well as cash deposited in support of trade agreements and performance bonds. At December 31, 2007, cash balances totaling $191 million were subject to such restrictions, compared to $214 million at December 31, 2006. Our ability to service our debt depends in part on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans or advances are generally or periodically subject to various restrictions. The primary restriction is that, in certain countries, we must obtain approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments restrict the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of overcoming these restrictions, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries that are subject to such restrictions to be integral to our liquidity or readily available to service our debt. At December 31, 2007, approximately $308 million of net assets were subject to such restrictions, compared to approximately $373 million at December 31, 2006. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $92 million in 2007, decreasing $353 million from $445 million in 2006. The decrease was due primarily to increased working capital requirements following the end of the USW strike. Operating cash flows from continuing operations in 2007 were favorably impacted by improved operating results. Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $445 million in 2006, decreasing $335 million from $780 million in 2005. The decrease was due in part to lower operating results. In addition, increased pension contributions, lower proceeds from insurance settlements, and higher rationalization payments adversely affected cash flows from operating activities in 2006. Lower working capital levels resulting from the USW strike and savings from our four point cost savings plan favorably affected operating cash flows from continuing operations. 47 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $606 million during 2007, compared to $498 million in 2006 and $408 million in 2005. Capital expenditures were $739 million, $637 million and $601 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Investing activities in 2007 exclude $132 million of capital expenditures that remain unpaid and accrued for at December 31, 2007. This was partially offset by cash provided from the sale of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs. Cash was used in 2006 for the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares that we did not already own of South Pacific Tyres Ltd., a joint venture tire manufacturer and distributor in Australia. Cash flows from investing activities of discontinued operations in 2007 included the net proceeds from the sale of our Engineered Products business. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of continuing operations was $(1,426) million in 2007, $1,648 million in 2006, and $(181) million in 2005. Non cash financing activities in 2007 included the issuance of 28.7 million shares of our common stock in exchange for approximately $346 million principal amount of our 4% convertible senior notes due 2034. Consolidated debt at December 31, 2007 was $4,725 million, compared to $7,210 million at December 31, 2006. Cash flows in 2007 included the repayment of approximately $2.3 billion of long term debt offset by net proceeds from our public equity offering of approximately $833 million. Consolidated debt at December 31, 2006 of $7,210 million increased from 2005 by $1,814 million due primarily to increased borrowings related to the USW strike and refinancing debt maturing in March 2007. Credit Sources In aggregate, we had credit arrangements of $7,392 million available at December 31, 2007, of which $2,169 million were unused, compared to $8,196 million available at December 31, 2006, of which $533 million were unused. Outstanding Notes At December 31, 2007, we had $2,634 million of outstanding notes as compared to $3,592 million at December 31, 2006. Certain of our notes were issued pursuant to indentures that contain varying covenants and other terms. In general, the terms of our indentures, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, under certain of our indentures, if the notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moodys and SP and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. In the first quarter of 2007, we repaid our $300 million 81/2% senior notes at their maturity. On June 29, 2007, we exercised our right to redeem $175 million of our $500 million 8.625% senior notes due 2011 and $140 million of our $400 million 9% senior notes due 2015. On December 10, 2007, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 4% convertible senior notes due 2034 for a cash payment and shares of our common stock. The exchange offer resulted in the issuance of approximately 28.7 million shares of common stock, a total cash payment, including accrued and unpaid interest, of approximately $23 million, and a reduction of debt of approximately $346 million. On February 1, 2008, we issued notices of redemption to the holders of our $650 million senior secured notes due 2011. As provided in the notice to the holders, on March 3, 2008, we will redeem $450 million in aggregate 48 Table of Contents principal amount of our 11% senior secured notes due 2011 at a redemption price of 105.5% of the principal amount thereof and $200 million in aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior secured notes due 2011 at a redemption price of 104% of the principal amount thereof, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. $1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013 On April 20, 2007, we amended and restated our first lien revolving credit facility. This facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under the facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. At December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $526 million of letters of credit were issued under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had $873 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $6 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings and $500 million of letters of credit issued under a deposit funded facility. The $500 million of letters of credit that were outstanding prior to the refinancing were transferred to the revolving credit facility in April 2007. $1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014 On April 20, 2007, we amended and restated our second lien term loan facility. The $1.2 billion in aggregate amount of term loans that were outstanding under this facility prior to the refinancing continue to be outstanding under the facility as amended and restated. Subject to the consent of the lenders making additional term loans, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $300 million. Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien credit facility. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, this facility was fully drawn. $300 Million Third Lien Secured Term Loan Facility due 2011 On August 16, 2007, we prepaid all outstanding borrowings under the $300 million third lien term loan at par. 505 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European and German Revolving Credit Facilities due 2012 On April 20, 2007, we amended and restated our facilities, which now consist of a 350 million European revolving credit facility, with a 50 million letter of credit sublimit, and a 155 million German revolving credit facility. Goodyear and its domestic subsidiaries that secure our U.S. facilities provide unsecured guarantees to support the European revolving credit facilities. Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (GDTE) and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany also provide guarantees. GDTEs obligations under the facilities and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Each of these facilities have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, material adverse change representations in our financial condition since December 31, 2006. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities. 49 Table of Contents EBITDA (per our Amended and Restated Credit Facilities) Our amended and restated credit facilities state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA (as defined in those facilities) (Covenant EBITDA) to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in those facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. In addition, if the amount of availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our Available Cash (as defined in that facility) is less than $150 million, we may not permit our ratio of Covenant EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense to be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Covenant EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure of these limitations imposed under our credit facilities. Covenant EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to either (i) income from operations or (ii) cash flows from operating activities. Our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. As a limitation on our ability to incur debt in accordance with our credit facilities could affect our liquidity, we believe that the presentation of Covenant EBITDA provides investors with important information. The following table presents the calculation of EBITDA and the calculation of Covenant EBITDA in accordance with the definitions in our amended and restated credit facilities for the periods indicated. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do. Certain line items are presented as defined in the credit facilities and do not reflect amounts as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Those line items also include discontinued operations.

Other Foreign Credit Facilities At December 31, 2007, we had short term committed and uncommitted bank credit arrangements totaling $564 million, of which $339 million were unused, compared to $479 million and $236 million at December 31, 2006. The continued availability of these arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender, and a portion of these arrangements may be terminated at any time. 50 Table of Contents International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet) On December 10, 2004, GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a five year pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. The facility provides 275 million of funding and is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity lines. As of December 31, 2007, the amount available and fully utilized under this program was $403 million compared to $362 million as of December 31, 2006. In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have accounts receivable securitization programs totaling $78 million and $81 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet) Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2007 and 2006. The receivable financing programs of these subsidiaries did not utilize a special purpose entity (SPE). At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the gross amount of receivables sold was $152 million and $88 million, respectively. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings as of the date of this report are presented below: SP Moodys $1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, due 2013 BB+ Baa3 $1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility, due 2014 BB Ba1 European Facilities BB+ Baa3 Floating Rate and 11% Senior Secured Notes, due 2011 B+ Ba3 Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2009 and 8.625% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2011 B Ba3 9% Senior Unsecured Notes, due 2015 B Ba3 All other Senior Unsecured B B2 Corporate Rating (implied) BB Ba3 Outlook Positive Positive Although we do not request ratings from Fitch, the rating agency rates our secured debt facilities (ranging from BB+ to B depending on the facility) and our unsecured debt (B). A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency, and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association On December 28, 2006, the USW ratified the terms of a new master labor agreement ending a strike by the USW. In connection with the master labor agreement, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the USW regarding the establishment of a VEBA intended to provide healthcare benefits for current and future USW retirees. The establishment of the VEBA is conditioned upon receiving District Court approval of a settlement of a declaratory judgment action. On July 3, 2007, the USW and several retirees filed a required class action lawsuit regarding the establishment of the VEBA in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. On October 29, 2007, the parties filed the signed settlement agreement within the District Court, and on December 14, 2007, the District Court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement and established the date for a hearing regarding the settlement. We plan to make our contributions to the VEBA entirely in cash following the U.S. District Courts approval of the settlement. In addition, we expect to remove our liability for USW retiree healthcare benefits from 51 Table of Contents our balance sheet when this settlement has received final judicial approval (including exhaustion of all appeals, if any) and we have made our contributions to the VEBA. We expect to use cash on hand and generated from operating activities, unused availability under our various credit agreements and or proceeds from the sale of our Engineered Products business to fund the VEBA. We do not expect our VEBA funding commitment or our inability to immediately remove our liability for USW retiree healthcare benefits from our balance sheet to have a significant impact on our liquidity or cash position. Furthermore, we do not expect our plan to fund the VEBA entirely in cash to have a significant impact on our operations or liquidity. Potential Future Financings In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. Future liquidity requirements also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt. Dividends Under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, we can incur additional indebtedness under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied. Asset Dispositions The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2007: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2007 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th After (In millions) Total Year Year Year Year Year 5 Years Long Term Debt(1) $ 4,685 $ 391 $ 959 $ 13 $ 1,624 $ 56 $ 1,642 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 53 8 8 7 7 7 16 Interest Payments(3) 1,367 290 265 195 173 111 333 Operating Leases(4) 1,403 311 244 192 144 106 406 Pension Benefits(5) 1,300 425 350 275 175 75 Other Post Retirement Benefits(6) 1,576 194 188 180 172 162 680 Workers Compensation(7) 379 85 45 32 24 19 174 Binding Commitments(8) 1,363 1,291 45 10 5 3 9 Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9) 70 15 11 2 42 $ 12,196 $ 3,010 $ 2,115 $ 906 $ 2,366 $ 539 $ 3,260 (1) Long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of December 31, 2007. Our $650 million senior secured notes due 2011 are included in the table as maturing in the 4th year. However, on February 1, 2008, we called for the redemption of all outstanding amounts on March 3, 2008. 52 Table of Contents (2) The present value of capital lease obligations is $40 million. (3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Payments related to variable debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2007 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. No interest payments for the $650 million senior secured notes were assumed beyond March 3, 2008, the date of the redemption. (4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $46 million, $35 million, $26 million, $16 million, $10 million, and $17 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $150 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,253 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $920 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2007. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table for 2008 (the 1st year), 2009 (the 2nd year) and 2010 (the 3rd year) represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law, and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non U.S. pension plans. For years after 2010, the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non U.S. pension plans, and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including: an ERISA liability interest rate of 6.05% for 2008, 6.15% for 2009, 6.35% for 2010, 6.50% for 2011, and 6.60% for 2012, and plan asset returns of 8.5% for 2008 and beyond. Future contributions are also effected by other factors such as: future interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions. (6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. These amounts will be reduced significantly provided the proposed settlement with the USW regarding retiree healthcare becomes effective. (7) The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $276 million. (8) Binding commitments are for our normal operations and are related primarily to obligations to acquire land, buildings and equipment. In addition, binding commitments includes obligations to purchase raw materials through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. (9) These amounts represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2007. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters. Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We 53 Table of Contents cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the Umbrella Agreement between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI commencing in 2009. In addition, the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the Umbrella Agreement, including certain bankruptcy events or changes in our control, could trigger a right of SRI to require us to purchase their interests in the global alliance immediately. SRIs exit rights, in the unlikely event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in the global alliance. The Umbrella Agreement provides that the payment amount would be based on the fair value of SRIs 25% minority shareholders interest in each of Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. and Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. and the book value of net assets of the Japanese joint ventures. The payment amount would be determined through a negotiation process where, if no mutually agreed amount was determined, a binding arbitration process would determine that amount. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase minimum amounts of a raw material at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments. We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees were not significant at December 31, 2007. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words estimate, expect, intend and project, as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10 K. Such statements are based on current expectations 54 Table of Contents and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including: if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected; a significant aspect of our master labor agreement with the USW is subject to court approval, which, if not received, could result in the termination and renegotiation of the agreement; we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline; our pension plans are underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expenses; higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may materially adversely affect our business; pending litigation relating to our 2003 restatement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition; our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness, is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results; we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health; any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations; our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner; our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly; we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims; our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded; we may be required to deposit cash collateral to support an appeal bond if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity; we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results; our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI in 2009 or thereafter, upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interest in certain of our joint venture alliances (which include much of our operations in Europe); if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; 55 Table of Contents work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our suppliers or our major OE customers could harm our business; and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Commodity Price Risk The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power and expand our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials. Interest Rate Risk We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps. We will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates, and are normally designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions. At December 31, 2007, 56% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 7.46% compared to 58% at an average rate of 7.85% at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the average variable interest rate was driven by decreases in the spread associated with our variable rate debt as a result of our April refinancing. We also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances. As a result of credit ratings actions and other related events, our access to these instruments may be limited. There were no contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007 or 2006. Weighted average interest rate swap contract information follows: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Fixed Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ $ $ 7 Pay fixed rate 5.94 % Receive variable LIBOR 5.66 % Floating Rate Contracts: Notional principal amount $ $ 183 $ 200 Pay variable LIBOR 6.67 % 4.92 % Receive fixed rate 6.63 % 6.63 % The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, including capital leases, at December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 Carrying amount liability $ 2,074 $ 2,998 Fair value liability 2,172 3,353 Pro forma fair value liability 2,223 3,440 56 Table of Contents The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis. The model assumes a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve. The precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency forward contract information at December 31: (In millions) 2007 2006 Fair value asset $1 $(1) Pro forma decrease in fair value (66) (44) Contract maturities 1/08 10/19 1/07 10/19 We were not a party to any foreign currency option contracts at December 31, 2007 or 2006. The pro forma change in fair value assumes a 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models. Fair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows: (In millions) 2007 2006 Asset (liability): Current asset $ 3 $ 3 Long term asset 5 3 Current liability (7 ) (7 ) Long term liability For further information on interest rate contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 11, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 57
