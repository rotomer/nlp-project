ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 57 manufacturing facilities in 23 countries, including the United States. We operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: North American Tire; Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire (EMEA); Latin American Tire; and Asia Pacific Tire. We experienced challenging industry conditions throughout 2009 due to recessionary economic conditions in many parts of the world during the first half of 2009 and a slow and uncertain recovery from those conditions in the second half of 2009. These industry conditions were characterized by lower motor vehicle sales and production and weakness in the demand for replacement tires, particularly in the commercial markets, compared to 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Goodyear net loss was $375 million, compared to a Goodyear net loss of $77 million in 2008. Our total segment operating income for 2009 was $372 million, compared to $804 million in 2008. The decline in segment operating income was due primarily to a significant increase in under absorbed fixed overhead costs and a decrease in tire volume. See Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information. Net sales were $16.3 billion in 2009, compared to $19.5 billion in 2008. Net sales declined due to lower tire volume, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, a decrease in other tire related businesses, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products, and foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA. The impact of the global economic slowdown on our 2009 operating results was mitigated by the success of the strategic initiatives we announced in February 2009 which were aimed at strengthening our revenue, cost structure and cash flow, including: continuing our focus on consumer driven product development and innovation by introducing more than 50 new tires globally, including several branded mid tier product offerings. During 2009, we achieved our goal and introduced 62 new products, such as the Assurance Fuel Max in North America and the EfficientGrip tire with Fuel Saving Technology in Europe; achieving our four point cost savings plan target of $2.5 billion by increasing our continuous improvement efforts, lowering our manufacturing costs, increasing purchasing savings, eliminating non essential discretionary spending, and reducing overhead and development costs, as discussed in more detail below. We achieved approximately $730 million of cost savings in 2009. In association with this plan, we had personnel reductions of approximately 5,700 people in 2009; reducing manufacturing capacity by 15 million to 25 million units by February 2011. We have announced planned manufacturing capacity reductions of approximately 8 million units in 2009 (including the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and the closing of our Las Pinas, Philippines plant); reducing inventory levels by over $500 million by the end of 2009 compared with 2008. We exceeded this goal and have reduced inventories by $1,149 million from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009; adjusting planned capital expenditures to between $700 million and $800 million in 2009 from $1,049 million in 2008. Our capital expenditures were $746 million in 2009; and pursuing additional non core asset sales, including our decision to pursue offers for our European and Latin American farm tire business. We exceeded our inventory reduction goal through the combination of lower raw material costs and the implementation of an advantaged supply chain, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, by improving demand forecasting, increasing production flexibility through shorter lead times and reduced production lot sizes, reducing the quantity of raw materials required to meet an improved demand forecast, changing the composition of our 28 Table of Contents logistics network by closing and consolidating certain distribution warehouses, increasing local production and reducing longer lead time off shore imports, and reducing in transit inventory between our plants and regional distribution centers. In spite of the challenging global and industry economic conditions we experienced, we had several key achievements in 2009: As described above, we met, and frequently exceeded, our financial and operating goals announced in February 2009 in the face of the global recession; We strengthened our liquidity position due, in significant part, to strong working capital management; We successfully completed a $1.0 billion senior unsecured notes offering in the second quarter that addressed a December 2009 debt maturity and further enhanced our liquidity position; We successfully addressed many of the challenges posed by the General Motors and Chrysler bankruptcies and did not suffer any material losses on our receivables; We completed a new four year master labor contract with the United Steelworkers (USW); and We continued to strengthen our leadership team. We expect 2010 to be a year of modest recovery, with increases in demand expected to improve our capacity utilization, which in turn will result in declines in unabsorbed fixed costs in 2010 as compared to 2009. As noted below, we also expect raw material cost pressures to intensify, particularly in the second half of 2010. In order to ensure that we are positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery, we will control our cost structure by increasing low cost sourcing to more than $900 million by the end of 2010, pursuing cost reduction initiatives that are targeted to achieve $1.0 billion of aggregate gross cost savings from 2010 to 2012, and continuing our commitment to reduce high cost manufacturing capacity by 15 to 25 million units by February 2011. We expect raw material costs for the first half of 2010 to decrease about 5% when compared to the same period of 2009, with a first quarter decrease of approximately 15%. The second half of the year should reflect increases approaching 30% as compared to the same period in 2009. Four Point Cost Savings Plan In 2009, we completed our four year, four point cost savings plan. We achieved $2.5 billion of aggregate gross cost savings from 2006 through 2009 compared with 2005. Those cost reductions consisted of: approximately $1.7 billion of estimated savings related to continuous improvement initiatives, including business process improvements, such as six sigma and lean manufacturing, manufacturing efficiencies, product reformulations and safety programs, and ongoing savings that we achieved from our prior master labor agreement with the USW; approximately $160 million of estimated savings from the reduction of high cost manufacturing capacity by over 25 million units; approximately $265 million of estimated savings related to our sourcing strategy of increasing our procurement of tires, raw materials, capital equipment and indirect materials from low cost countries; and approximately $415 million of estimated savings from reductions in selling, administrative and general expense related to initiatives including benefit plan changes, back office and warehouse consolidations, supply chain improvements, legal entity reductions and headcount rationalizations. We will continue to implement various cost reduction initiatives and expect to achieve $1.0 billion in aggregate gross cost savings from 2010 through 2012 through our four point cost savings plan. We will continue to focus on savings from continuous improvement initiatives, including savings under our new USW agreement described below, low cost country sourcing, high cost capacity reductions and reduced selling, administrative and general expenses. 29 Table of Contents USW Collective Bargaining Agreement In September 2009, members of the USW ratified a new four year master labor contract with Goodyear. The new contract enhances the competitiveness of our USW represented tire plants through improvements in productivity, wage and benefit savings and added flexibility. These changes are expected to provide us with cost savings of approximately $215 million over the term of the contract. Combined with savings realized through pre bargain agreements to reduce staffing levels at five U.S. plants, we expect to realize approximately $555 million in total savings over the term of the agreements. Pension and Benefit Plans During 2009, our domestic pension fund experienced market gains, which increased plan assets by $699 million and decreased net actuarial losses included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) by $464 million. As a result, annual domestic net periodic pension cost will decrease to approximately $200 million to $225 million in 2010 from $300 million in 2009, primarily due to expected returns on higher plan assets and amortization of lower net actuarial losses from AOCL. Liquidity At December 31, 2009, we had $1,922 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $2,567 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $1,894 million and $1,671 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by improvements in trade working capital of $1,081 million and proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $746 million, the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009 and the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due 2013. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in 2010 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. New Products In 2009, we successfully launched the Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max in North America. We also announced the launch of 14 new products in our commercial truck tire business, including two new Fuel Max products. In addition, in 2009 we announced plans to begin production of a 63 inch, 12,000 pound off the road tire for applications on mining and earthmoving equipment. At our North American dealer conference in early 2010, we introduced several key products, most notably the Goodyear Assurance ComforTred Touring tire. This premium tier consumer tire provides a smooth, quiet and comfortable ride primarily on passenger cars and luxury sedans. Additionally, we are adding key sizes to supplement new consumer products launched in recent years, including our award winning Fuel Max tires, which are certified by the EPA in helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, we introduced the third generation of RunOnFlat tire technology, offering comfort, reduced mass and rolling resistance, increased fuel economy and reduced carbon dioxide emission levels. We also introduced our Goodyear EfficientGrip tire with Fuel Saving Technology which has improved wet braking distance, while providing better mileage and rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption. In addition, we extended our ultra high performance Dunlop SportMaxx TT and SportMaxx GT lines, and our Goodyear Max Technology line of commercial tires. In Latin America, we launched the new Eagle GT consumer tire after its successful introduction in North America. In our commercial business, a new design of the G32 line was launched, offering significantly improved tread wear performance, and we introduced the 600 series products with Duralife Technology throughout the region. In Asia Pacific, we launched DuraPlus with TredLife technology, providing improved mileage, and in Australia, we introduced several new consumer products including the Goodyear Wrangler MT/R with Kevlar. 30 Table of Contents Industry Volume Estimates The industry environment remains challenging and will continue to impact our performance in 2010. Our outlook for the industry for 2010 in North America is expected to be stronger as compared to 2009, but significantly below 2007 levels. We expect consumer replacement will improve 1% to 3%, as volumes continue to recover slowly. We believe consumer OE will increase 20% to 30%. Commercial replacement is expected to increase 1% to 5%, while commercial OE, which was negatively impacted the most significantly in 2009, is expected to increase 5% to 15%. The net impact of higher volume in 2010 will have a positive impact on North American Tire; however, mix pressures will increase due to the stronger anticipated recovery in OE than in replacement. In Europe, we anticipate less favorable conditions for recovery in 2010. For consumer tires, we see markets that range from flat up to a 2% increase in replacement and range from a decrease of 3% to an increase of 5% in OE. For commercial tires, we expect an increase of 5% to 10% in replacement and an increase of 20% to 30% in OE. Finally, we expect growth to continue in the emerging markets our products serve.

Risk Factors at page 13 for a discussion of the factors that may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and Forward Looking Information Safe Harbor Statement at page 55 for a discussion of our use of forward looking statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED All per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net income (loss). As a result of the sale of substantially all of our Engineered Products business on July 31, 2007, we have reported the results of that segment prior to the sale as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relate to continuing operations. 2009 Compared to 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, Goodyear net loss was $375 million, or $1.55 per share, compared to $77 million, or $0.32 per share, in 2008. Net Sales Net sales in 2009 of $16.3 billion decreased $3.2 billion, or 16%, compared to 2008 due primarily to lower tire volume of $1.4 billion, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, reduced sales in other tire related businesses of $924 million, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products, and foreign currency translation of $699 million, primarily in EMEA. Net sales also decreased $124 million due to unfavorable changes in product mix net of pricing improvements, reflecting a lower mix of high value added commercial truck and off the road tires due to ongoing weakness in those markets. The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, (In millions of tires) 2009 2008 % Change Replacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 50.0 51.4 (2.9 )% International 78.0 82.7 (5.7 )% Total 128.0 134.1 (4.6 )% OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 12.7 19.7 (35.5 )% International 26.3 30.7 (14.1 )% Total 39.0 50.4 (22.5 )% Goodyear worldwide tire units 167.0 184.5 (9.5 )% 31 Table of Contents The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 17.5 million units, or 9.5% compared to 2008, included a decrease of 11.4 million OE units, or 22.5%, due primarily to decreases in the consumer markets in North American Tire and EMEA due to recessionary economic conditions resulting in lower demand for new vehicles, and a decrease of 6.1 million units, or 4.6%, in replacement units, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA. North American Tire consumer replacement volume decreased 1.1 million units, or 2.3%, and EMEA consumer replacement volume decreased 2.7 million units, or 5.1%. The decline in consumer replacement volume is due in part to recessionary economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was $13.7 billion in 2009, decreasing $2.5 billion, or 15% compared to 2008. CGS in 2009 decreased due primarily to lower tire volume of $1.2 billion, mainly in North American Tire and EMEA, lower costs in other tire related businesses of $788 million, primarily in North American Tires cost of chemical products, foreign currency translation of $616 million, primarily in EMEA, product mix related manufacturing cost decreases of $331 million and lower raw material costs of $115 million. CGS also benefited from savings from rationalization plans of $105 million. CGS was unfavorably impacted by increased conversion costs of $655 million, due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $490 million due to lower production volume. CGS in 2009 included charges for accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs of $43 million ($38 million after tax or $0.16 per share), compared to $28 million in 2008 ($28 million after tax or $0.12 per share). CGS in 2009 also included a charge of $5 million ($5 million after tax or $0.02 per share) related to our new labor contract with the USW. CGS was 83.9% of sales in 2009 compared to 82.8% in 2008. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) was $2.4 billion in 2009, decreasing $196 million, or 8% compared to 2008. SAG decreased due primarily to reduced foreign currency translation of $105 million, lower advertising expenses of $52 million, savings from rationalization plans of $42 million, reduced transportation and warehousing costs of $27 million, lower costs for consultants and contract labor of $22 million and other cost reduction actions. SAG reflected increased incentive compensation costs of $97 million of which approximately 50% was due to an increase in our stock price. SAG in 2009 was 14.7% of sales, compared to 13.3% in 2008. Rationalizations To maintain global competitiveness, we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years to reduce excess and high cost manufacturing capacity and to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses through associate headcount reductions. We recorded net rationalization charges of $227 million in 2009 ($182 million after tax or $0.75 per share). Rationalization actions in 2009 consisted of initiatives in North American Tire to reduce manufacturing headcount at several facilities, including Union City, Tennessee; Danville, Virginia and Topeka, Kansas, to respond to lower production demand. Additional salaried headcount reductions were initiated at our corporate offices in Akron, Ohio, in North American Tire and throughout EMEA. We also initiated the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and manufacturing headcount reductions at each of our two facilities in Brazil. Additional rationalization charges of $20 million related to rationalization plans announced in 2009 have not yet been recorded and are expected to be incurred and recorded during the next twelve months. We recorded net rationalization charges of $184 million in 2008 ($167 million after tax or $0.69 per share), which consisted primarily of the closure of the Somerton, Australia tire manufacturing facility, the closure of the Tyler, Texas mix center, and our plan to exit 92 of our underperforming retail stores in the U.S. Other rationalization actions in 2008 related to plans to reduce manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions in all of our strategic business units. Upon completion of the 2009 plans, we estimate that annual operating costs will be reduced by approximately $261 million ($224 million CGS and $37 million SAG). The savings realized in 2009 for the 2009 plans totaled $86 million ($68 million CGS and $18 million SAG) In addition, savings realized in 2009 for the 2008 plans totaled $76 million ($46 million CGS and $30 million SAG). 32 Table of Contents For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. Interest Expense Interest expense was $311 million in 2009, decreasing $9 million compared to 2008. The decrease was due primarily to lower weighted average interest rates in 2009, partially offset by higher average debt levels. Other Expense Other Expense was $40 million in 2009 compared to $59 million in 2008. Other Expense in 2009 decreased due primarily to lower expenses for financing fees and financial instruments, general and product liability discontinued products, and foreign currency exchange. Other Expense in 2009 was adversely affected by net losses on asset sales and lower interest income. Other Expense in 2009 included a gain of $26 million ($13 million after tax or $0.05 per share) from the recognition of insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand, net losses on asset sales of $30 million ($30 million after tax or $0.13 per share) due primarily to the sale of properties in Akron, Ohio, a loss on the liquidation of our subsidiary in Guatemala of $18 million ($18 million after tax or $0.08 per share), and a charge for a legal reserve for a closed facility of $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.02 per share). For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other Expense. Income Taxes Tax expense in 2009 was $7 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $357 million. For 2008, we recorded tax expense of $209 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $186 million. Our income tax expense or benefit is allocated among operations and items charged or credited directly to shareholders equity. Pursuant to this allocation requirement, for 2009, a $100 million non cash tax benefit ($0.42 per share) has been allocated to the loss from our U.S. operations, with offsetting tax expense allocated to items, primarily attributable to employee benefits, charged directly to shareholders equity. Income tax expense in 2009 also included net tax benefits of $42 million ($0.18 per share) primarily related to a $29 million benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on our Australian operations and a $19 million benefit resulting from the settlement of our 1997 through 2003 Competent Authority claim between the United States and Canada. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above. Our losses in various taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. However, in certain foreign locations, it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all, or a portion, of these valuation allowances within the next 12 months will exist, resulting in possible one time tax benefits of up to $20 million ($20 million net of minority interest). For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. Minority Shareholders Net Income Minority shareholders net income was $11 million in 2009, compared to $54 million in 2008. The decrease was due primarily to decreased earnings in our joint venture in Europe. 2008 Compared to 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, Goodyear net loss was $77 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to net income of $583 million, or $2.84 per share, in the comparable period of 2007. Goodyear loss from continuing 33 Table of Contents operations in 2008 was $77 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to income from continuing operations of $120 million, or $0.59 per share, in 2007. Net Sales Net sales in 2008 were $19.5 billion, decreasing $156 million, or less than 1% compared to 2007. Net sales in 2008 were unfavorably impacted by decreased volume of $1,318 million, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA and a reduction in sales from the 2007 divestiture of our tire and wheel assembly operation, which contributed sales of $639 million in 2007. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in price and product mix of $1,151 million, mainly in North American Tire, EMEA and Latin American Tire, $383 million in foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA and Latin American Tire, and an increase in other tire related business sales of $268 million, primarily due to third party sales of chemical products in North American Tire. The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, (In millions of tires) 2008 2007 % Change Replacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 51.4 55.7 (7.7 )% International 82.7 86.2 (4.1 )% Total 134.1 141.9 (5.5 )% OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 19.7 25.6 (22.9 )% International 30.7 34.2 (10.2 )% Total 50.4 59.8 (15.7 )% Goodyear worldwide tire units 184.5 201.7 (8.5 )% The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 17.2 million units, or 8.5% compared to 2007, included a decrease of 9.4 million OE units, or 15.7%, due primarily to decreases in the consumer markets in North American Tire and EMEA due to recessionary economic conditions resulting in lower demand for new vehicles, and a decrease of 7.8 million units, or 5.5%, in replacement units, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA. North American Tire consumer replacement volume decreased 3.9 million units, or 7.4%, and EMEA consumer replacement volume decreased 2.5 million units, or 4.6%. The decline in consumer replacement volume is due in part to recessionary economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe. Cost of Goods Sold CGS was $16.1 billion in 2008, an increase of $228 million, or 1% compared to the 2007 period. CGS was 82.8% of sales in 2008 compared to 81.0% in 2007. CGS in 2008 increased due to higher raw material costs of $712 million, higher foreign currency translation of $287 million, $265 million of increased costs related to other tire related businesses, primarily due to increased third party sales and raw materials costs of chemical products in North American Tire, product mix related cost increases of $209 million, mostly related to North American Tire and EMEA, and higher transportation costs of $27 million. Also negatively impacting CGS was $506 million of higher conversion costs, including approximately $370 million of under absorbed fixed overhead costs due to lower production volume in all segments, and a VEBA related charge of $9 million. Reducing CGS were lower volume, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, of $1,069 million, savings from rationalization plans of $53 million, and lower accelerated depreciation of $9 million. CGS also benefited from decreased costs related to the 2007 divestiture of our tire and wheel assembly operation, which had costs of $614 million in 2007. Included in 2007 was a curtailment charge of approximately $27 million related to the benefit plan changes announced in the first quarter of 2007. 34 Table of Contents Selling, Administrative and General Expense SAG was $2.6 billion in 2008, a decrease of $162 million or 6%. SAG in 2008 was 13.3% of sales, compared to 14.1% in 2007. The decrease was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation costs of $156 million primarily due to changes in estimated payouts and a decline in our stock price, lower advertising expenses of $36 million and savings from rationalization plans of $9 million. These were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $41 million and increased wages and other benefit costs of $32 million. Included in 2007 was $37 million related to a curtailment charge for benefit plan changes. Rationalizations We recorded net rationalization charges of $184 million in 2008 which consisted primarily of the closure of the Somerton, Australia tire manufacturing facility, Tyler, Texas mix center, and 92 of our underperforming retail stores in the U.S. Other rationalization actions in 2008 related to plans to reduce manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions in all of our strategic business units. We recorded net rationalization charges of $49 million ($41 million after tax or $0.20 per share) in 2007 and consisted primarily of a decision to reduce tire production at two facilities in Amiens, France in EMEA. Other rationalization actions in 2007 related to plans to reduce manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions in several strategic business units. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. Interest Expense Interest expense was $320 million in 2008, a decrease of $148 million compared to $468 million in 2007. The decrease related primarily to lower average debt levels due to the repayment of our $300 million term loan due March 2011 in August 2007, the repayment of $175 million of 8.625% notes due 2011 and $140 million of 9% notes due 2015 in June 2007, and the exchange of $346 million of our 4% convertible notes in the fourth quarter of 2007 for shares of our common stock and a cash payment. In addition, we repaid $200 million of floating rate notes due 2011, $450 million of 11% notes due 2011, and $100 million of 63/8% notes due 2008 during the first quarter of 2008. Also decreasing interest expense was a decline in interest rates on variable rate debt. Other Expense Other Expense was $59 million in 2008, compared to $9 million in 2007. The increase in expense was primarily due to lower interest income of $60 million in 2008 due to lower average cash balances and interest rates, charges of $43 million ($43 million after tax or $0.18 per share) related to the redemption of long term debt, and higher foreign currency exchange losses of $26 million. In addition, we liquidated our subsidiary in Jamaica and recognized a loss of $16 million ($16 million after tax or $0.07 per share) primarily due to recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses. Net gains on asset sales of $53 million ($50 million after tax or $0.21 per share) in 2008, compared to net gains on asset sales of $15 million ($11 million after tax or $0.05 per share) in 2007, primarily related to the sale of certain properties in England, Germany, Morocco, Argentina and New Zealand in 2008 and the sale of certain properties in England and Australia offset by the loss on the sale of substantially all of the assets of North American Tires tire and wheel assembly operation in 2007. Other Expense in 2008 also included increased royalty income of $17 million from licensing arrangements related to divested businesses, including our Engineered Products business that was divested in the third quarter of 2007. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other Expense. Income Taxes For 2008, we recorded tax expense of $209 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $186 million. For 2007, we recorded tax expense of $255 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $445 million. 35 Table of Contents The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was primarily due to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed below. For 2008 total discrete tax items in income tax expense were insignificant. Income tax expense in 2007 includes a net tax benefit totaling $6 million, which consists of a tax benefit of $11 million ($0.06 per share) related to prior periods offset by a $5 million charge primarily related to enacted tax law changes. The 2007 out of period adjustment related to our correction of the inflation adjustment on equity of our subsidiary in Colombia as a permanent tax benefit rather than as a temporary tax benefit dating back as far as 1992, with no individual year being significantly affected. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. Minority Shareholders Net Income Minority shareholders net income was $54 million in 2008, a decrease of $16 million compared to $70 million in 2007. The decrease primarily relates to decreased earnings in our joint venture in Europe. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 1, Accounting Policies for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to: general and product liability and other litigation, workers compensation, recoverability of goodwill, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions, and pensions and other postretirement benefits. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos 1) in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past, or 2) in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts. We engage an independent asbestos valuation firm, Bates White, LLC (Bates), to review our existing reserves for pending asbestos claims, provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims, and estimate our receivables from probable insurance recoveries related to such claims. 36 Table of Contents A significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $136 million at December 31, 2009. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was $70 million. At December 31, 2009, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities, net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries, could exceed our recorded amounts by $15 million. We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration relevant factors or agreements in principle, including ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers, their financial viability, their legal obligations and other pertinent facts. Bates also assists us in valuing receivables to be recorded for probable insurance recoveries. Based upon the model employed by Bates, as of December 31, 2009, (i) we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $69 million, and (ii) we expect that approximately 50% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. The receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Of this amount, $11 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts receivable at December 31, 2009. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $301 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers compensation claims at December 31, 2009. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return. For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Recoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized. Rather, goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $706 million at December 31, 2009. We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units: North American Tire, Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, Latin American Tire, and Asia Pacific Tire. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units. There have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated. Our annual impairment testing is conducted as of July 31st each year and for 2009 our analysis indicated no impairment of goodwill. For purposes of our annual testing in 2009, we determined the estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow approach. We believe this methodology is appropriate in the determination of fair value. We may also use different fair value techniques when we believe a discounted cash flow approach may not provide an appropriate determination of fair value. The discounted cash flow model of the reporting units is based on the forecasted operating cash flow for the current year, projected operating cash flows for the next nine years (determined using forecasted amounts as well as an estimated growth rate) and a terminal value beyond ten years. Discounted cash flows consist of the operating cash flows for each business unit less an estimate for capital expenditures. The key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow approach include growth rates, projected segment operating income, changes in working capital, our plan for capital expenditures, anticipated funding for pensions, and a discount rate equal to our assumed long term cost of capital. Corporate administrative expenses are allocations of corporate overhead that we make to 37 Table of Contents each strategic business unit and are excluded from the discounted cash flow model. Cash flows may be adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items. As segment operating income was the starting point for determining operating cash flow, which excludes non recurring or unusual items, there were no other non recurring or unusual items excluded from the calculations of operating cash flow in any of the periods included in our determination of fair value. We consider significant decreases in forecasted cash flows in future periods to be an indication of a potential impairment. At the time of our annual impairment testing, fair value would have to decline in excess of 65% for North American Tire, over 30% for EMEA and in excess of 20% for Asia Pacific Tire to indicate potential goodwill impairment. The discount rate used would have to increase over five percentage points for North American Tire, over four percentage points for EMEA and over two percentage points for Asia Pacific Tire and the assumed growth rate would have to be negative for each of the business units to indicate a potential impairment. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2009, we had a valuation allowance aggregating $3.0 billion against all of our net Federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets. We assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in the U.S. and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal, state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including: life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, long term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation levels, future health care costs, and maximum company covered benefit costs. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is 38 Table of Contents derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated AA or higher by Standard Poors as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. The total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over a period of 15 years or more, estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation. Actual domestic pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected. The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans was 5.75% and 5.45%, respectively, at December 31, 2009, compared to 6.50% for our U.S pension and other postretirement plans at December 31, 2008. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2009 was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $314 million in 2009, compared to $312 million in 2008 and $306 million in 2007. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $32 million in 2009, compared to $84 million in 2008 and $109 million in 2007. Interest cost was lower in 2009 as a result of the reduction in the postretirement liability due to the VEBA settlement. The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement obligation, shareholders equity, and 2010 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: + / Change at December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) Change PBO/ABO Equity 2010 Expense Pensions: Assumption: Discount rate +/0.5 % $ 279 $ 279 $ 11 Actual 2009 return on assets +/1.0 % N/A 28 5 Expected return on assets +/1.0 % N/A N/A 34 Other Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate +/0.5 % $ 11 $ 11 $ Health care cost trends total cost +/1.0 % 3 3 A significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $2,311 million in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2009 is a result of 2008 plan asset losses and the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining our 2009 U.S. net periodic pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $154 million of the net actuarial loss in 2009. We will recognize approximately $135 million of net actuarial losses in 2010. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2009, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2010 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 25.6%, (31.7)% and 8.1% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 8.5% for all three years. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans. We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2009 and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $139 million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2009 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. The net actuarial loss increased from 2008 due to the decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2009. For purposes of determining 2009 worldwide net periodic postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $5 million of the net actuarial losses in 2009. We will recognize approximately $9 million of net actuarial losses in 2010. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions 39 Table of Contents as of December 31, 2009, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2010 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. plans is approximately 14 years. For further information on pensions and other postretirement benefits, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 14, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit and Savings Plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects our strategic business units (SBUs), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis. Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write off and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items. Total segment operating income was $372 million in 2009, $804 million in 2008 and $1.2 billion in 2007. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2009 was 2.3%, compared to 4.1% in 2008 and 6.3% in 2007. Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes. North American Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Tire Units 62.7 71.1 81.3 Net Sales $ 6,977 $ 8,255 $ 8,862 Operating (Loss) Income (305 ) (156 ) 139 Operating Margin (4.4 )% (1.9 )% 1.6 % 2009 Compared to 2008 North American Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 8.4 million units or 11.9% from the 2008 period. The decrease was primarily related to a decline in OE volume of 7 million units or 35.5% primarily in our consumer business, due to reduced vehicle production. Replacement volume decreased 1.4 million units or 2.9%, primarily in the consumer business, due to continuing recessionary economic conditions. Net sales in 2009 decreased $1.3 billion or 15.5% compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased sales in other tire related businesses of $729 million, primarily related to third party sales of chemical products, lower tire volume of $635 million and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million. Net sales were favorably affected by improved price and product mix of $124 million. Operating loss in 2009 increased $149 million or 95.5% compared to 2008 due primarily to higher conversion costs of $220 million, decreased sales volume of $77 million and lower operating income in chemical and other tire related businesses of $82 million. Conversion costs increased due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $245 million as a result of reduced production volume, and increased pension expense as a result of lower 2008 returns on plan assets and higher amortization of net losses. Increased pension and defined 40 Table of Contents contribution expense of $159 million more than offset savings resulting from the implementation of the VEBA of $89 million. Conversion costs were favorably impacted by savings from rationalization plans of $60 million and lower utility costs of $21 million. Operating income was favorably affected by lower raw material costs of $85 million, improved price and product mix of $78 million, reduced SAG of $38 million and lower transportation costs of $19 million. SAG decreased due primarily to reduced warehousing costs and savings from rationalization programs. Operating loss in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $112 million, $16 million of charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs, and net gains on asset sales of $4 million. Operating income in 2008 excluded net rationalization charges of $54 million, net gains on asset sales of $18 million and $3 million of charges for accelerated depreciation. 2008 Compared to 2007 North American Tire unit sales in 2008 decreased 10.2 million units or 12.4% from the 2007 period. The decrease was due to a decline in replacement volume of 4.3 million units or 7.7%, primarily in the consumer market due in part to recessionary economic conditions in the U.S., and a decline in OE volume of 5.9 million units or 22.9%, primarily in our consumer business due to reduced vehicle production. Net sales decreased $607 million or 6.8% in 2008 from the 2007 period due primarily to decreased volume of $718 million and the 2007 divestiture of our tire and wheel assembly operation, which contributed sales of $639 million in 2007. This was offset in part by favorable price and product mix of $537 million, increased sales in other tire related businesses of $207 million, primarily due to third party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency translation of $6 million. Operating loss in 2008 was $156 million compared to operating income in 2007 of $139 million, a decrease of $295 million. The 2008 period was unfavorably impacted by decreased volume of $115 million, lower operating income of chemical and other tire related businesses of $27 million, and the 2007 divestiture of our tire and wheel assembly operation, which generated operating income of $25 million in 2007. Also unfavorably impacting operating income were higher conversion costs of $231 million. The higher conversion costs were caused primarily by under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $240 million due to lower production volume, higher plant changeover costs and general inflation, which were partially offset by savings from reduced employee benefit costs, and lower average labor rates. Offsetting these negative factors were price and product mix improvements of $360 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs of $334 million, lower SAG expenses of $48 million driven primarily by decreased advertising costs and lower incentive compensation costs, and increased royalty income of $11 million. Operating income in 2008 excludes $3 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of the Tyler, Texas mix center and our plan to exit 92 retail stores. Operating income in 2007 excludes $35 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the elimination of tire production at our Tyler, Texas and Valleyfield, Quebec facilities. Operating income also excludes net rationalization charges totaling $54 million in 2008 and $11 million in 2007 and (gains) losses on asset sales of $(18) million in 2008 and $17 million in 2007. Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Tire Units 66.0 73.6 79.6 Net Sales $ 5,801 $ 7,316 $ 7,217 Operating Income 166 425 582 Operating Margin 2.9 % 5.8 % 8.1 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 7.6 million units or 10.3% from the 2008 period. OE volume decreased 4.5 million units or 25.4%, primarily in our consumer business, due to reduced vehicle 41 Table of Contents production. Replacement volume decreased 3.1 million units or 5.5%, primarily in the consumer business, due to continuing recessionary economic conditions. Net sales in 2009 decreased $1.5 billion or 20.7% compared to 2008, due primarily to lower volume of $665 million, foreign currency translation of $450 million and lower sales in other tire related businesses of $150 million. Net sales also decreased by $250 million as a result of unfavorable changes in product mix, net of pricing improvements. Operating income in 2009 decreased $259 million or 60.9% compared to 2008, due primarily to higher conversion costs of $258 million, decreased volume of $148 million, and decreased operating income in other tire related businesses of $44 million. Conversion costs increased due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $195 million due to reduced production volume. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $19 million. Operating income was favorably affected by lower SAG expenses of $113 million, improved price and mix of $22 million, lower raw material costs of $16 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $16 million. SAG savings included lower advertising expenses of $45 million, savings from rationalization plans of $20 million, lower consulting and contract labor costs of $16 million and reduced travel related expenses of $16 million. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $82 million and net gains on asset sales of $1 million. Operating income in 2008 excluded net rationalization charges of $41 million and net gains on asset sales of $20 million. EMEAs results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 33% and 32% of EMEAs net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Germany will have a significant impact on EMEAs future performance. 2008 Compared to 2007 Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2008 decreased 6.0 million units or 7.5% from the 2007 period. Replacement volume decreased 2.9 million units or 4.9%, mainly in consumer replacement due in part to recessionary economic conditions in Europe, while OE volume decreased 3.1 million units or 14.9%, primarily in our consumer business due to reduced vehicle production. Net sales in 2008 increased $99 million or 1.4% compared to the 2007 period. Favorably impacting the 2008 period were improved price and product mix of $306 million, foreign currency translation of $285 million, and higher sales in the other tire related businesses of $11 million. Partially offsetting these improvements was lower volume of $503 million. For 2008, operating income decreased $157 million or 27.0% compared to 2007 due to higher conversion costs of $173 million, lower volume of $107 million, and higher transportation costs of $17 million. The higher conversion costs related primarily to under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $100 million due to reduced production volume, inflation, a strike at our plants in Turkey in the second quarter of 2008 and ongoing labor issues at our manufacturing plants in Amiens, France. These were offset in part by improvement in price and product mix of $261 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs of $185 million, favorable foreign currency translation of $32 million, increased operating income in other tire related businesses of $21 million primarily due to improvements in our company owned retail businesses, decreased SAG expenses of $7 million and favorable supplier settlements of $7 million. Operating income in 2008 excludes rationalization charges of $41 million and net gains on asset sales of $20 million. Operating income in 2007 excludes net rationalization charges of $33 million and net gains on asset sales of $20 million. Operating income in 2007 excludes $2 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of the Washington, UK facility. 42 Table of Contents Latin American Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Tire Units 19.1 20.0 21.8 Net Sales $ 1,814 $ 2,088 $ 1,872 Operating Income 301 367 359 Operating Margin 16.6 % 17.6 % 19.2 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 0.9 million units or 4.5% from the 2008 period. Replacement tire volume decreased 0.8 million units or 5.9%, reflecting reduced volume in both consumer and commercial businesses. OE volume decreased 0.1 million units or 1.3%, primarily due to a decrease in our commercial business. Net sales in 2009 decreased $274 million or 13.1% from the 2008 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $123 million, decreased volume of $92 million, lower sales of other tire related businesses of $33 million, and $26 million as a result of unfavorable changes in product mix, net of pricing improvements. Operating income in 2009 decreased $66 million or 18.0% from the same period in 2008, due primarily to higher conversion costs of $43 million, lower volume of $28 million, lower profitability on intersegment transfers of $21 million, higher inventory reserves of $4 million and costs related to manufacturing start up activities of $3 million. Conversion costs increased due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $43 million and other inflation of $10 million. Conversion costs also included savings from rationalization plans of $15 million. Operating income was favorably affected by improvements in price and product mix of $69 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $16 million. Operating income in 2008 included a gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of an excise tax case. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $20 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million. Operating income in 2008 excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and net rationalization charges of $4 million. In addition, operating income excluded charges of $18 million and $16 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting from the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses in connection with the liquidation of our subsidiaries in Guatemala and Jamaica. Latin American Tires results are highly dependent upon Brazil, which accounted for approximately 51% and 52% of Latin American Tires net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Brazil will have a significant impact on Latin American Tires future performance. Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2009. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions are expected to adversely impact Latin American Tires operating results by $50 million to $75 million as compared to 2009. For further information see Item 1. Business Recent Developments Venezuelan Currency Devaluation, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview in this Form 10 K. 2008 Compared to 2007 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2008 decreased 1.8 million units or 8.3% from the 2007 period. Replacement volume decreased 0.8 million units or 5.8% primarily in the commercial market due to an overall decline in industry volumes, while OE volume decreased 1.0 million units or 13.4% primarily in the consumer market. Net sales in 2008 increased $216 million or 11.5% from the 2007 period. Net sales increased in 2008 due to favorable price and product mix of $237 million, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil, of approximately $85 million, and higher sales of other tire related businesses of $47 million. Partially offsetting these increases was lower volume of $152 million. Operating income in 2008 increased $8 million or 2.2% from the same period in 2007. Favorably impacting operating income were price and product mix of $214 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs 43 Table of Contents of $109 million, and foreign currency translation of $17 million. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher conversion costs of $57 million, decreased volume of $41 million, increased transportation costs of $12 million, increased tire recycling fees, duties and other charges of $9 million, and increased SAG expenses of $5 million, primarily related to advertising expenses. The higher conversion costs related primarily to under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $20 million due to reduced production volume in the fourth quarter of 2008 and higher utility and engineering costs. Operating income in 2008 also included a gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a transactional excise tax case. Operating income excludes net rationalization charges totaling $4 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007. Operating income also excludes gains on asset sales of $5 million in 2008 and $1 million in 2007. Operating income in 2008 excludes a $16 million loss primarily due to the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses on the liquidation of our subsidiary in Jamaica. Asia Pacific Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Tire Units 19.2 19.8 19.0 Net Sales $ 1,709 $ 1,829 $ 1,693 Operating Income 210 168 150 Operating Margin 12.3 % 9.2 % 8.9 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 0.6 million units or 2.9% from the 2008 period. Replacement unit sales decreased 0.8 million units or 6.3%, while OE volumes increased 0.2 million units or 3.4%, primarily in the consumer business. The net decrease in units is due to continuing recessionary economic conditions, primarily in Australia, that were partially offset by increased growth in vehicle production in China. Net sales in 2009 decreased $120 million or 6.6% compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $88 million, lower volume of $48 million and decreased sales in other tire related businesses of $12 million, primarily in the retail business. Net sales were favorably affected by improved price and product mix of $28 million. Operating income in 2009 increased $42 million or 25.0% compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to improved price and mix of $38 million, lower raw material costs of $30 million and decreased conversion costs of $6 million. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $12 million, partially offset by $7 million of under absorbed fixed overhead costs due to reduced production volume. Operating income in 2009 included a gain of $7 million from insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2007. Operating income was adversely affected by lower volume of $13 million, decreased operating income in other tire related businesses of $8 million, and increases in incentive compensation expense of $9 million and in the cost of imported finished tires of $6 million. Operating income in 2009 and 2008 excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs of $26 million and $24 million, and net rationalization charges of $10 million and $83 million, respectively, primarily related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Las Pinas, Philippines and Somerton, Australia. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and $10 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 45% and 47% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. 44 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2008 increased 0.8 million units or 4.1% from the 2007 period. Replacement unit sales increased 0.2 million units or 1.8% and OE volume increased 0.6 million units or 8.6%. The increase in OE volume in 2008 relates primarily to supply constraints in 2007 due to the Thailand fire. Net sales in 2008 increased $136 million or 8.0% compared to the 2007 period due to favorable price and product mix of $71 million, increased volume of $55 million, and favorable foreign currency translation of $7 million. Operating income in 2008 increased $18 million or 12.0% compared to the 2007 period due to improved price and product mix of $107 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs of $84 million, increased volume of $14 million and increased operating income in other tire related businesses of $8 million primarily due to improved results in our company owned retail businesses in Australia. Unfavorably impacting operating income was increased conversion costs of $26 million. The higher conversion costs related primarily to under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $10 million due to reduced production volume in the fourth quarter of 2008, inflation and higher utility and engineering costs. Operating income excludes net rationalization charges totaling $83 million in 2008 and $1 million in 2007 and gains on assets sales of $10 million in 2008 and $8 million in 2007. Operating income in 2007 also excludes a $12 million loss, net of insurance proceeds, as a result of the Thailand fire. In addition, operating income in 2008 excludes approximately $24 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Somerton, Australia facility. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We experienced challenging industry conditions throughout 2009 due to recessionary economic conditions in many parts of the world during the first half of 2009 and a slow and uncertain recovery from those conditions in the second half of 2009. These industry conditions were characterized by lower motor vehicle sales and production and weakness in the demand for replacement tires, particularly in the commercial markets, compared to 2008. Given the difficult economic environment and the uncertainty in the capital markets, we took several actions to strengthen our liquidity in 2009, including strong working capital management. We also successfully completed a $1.0 billion senior unsecured notes offering in the second quarter of 2009 that addressed a December 2009 debt maturity and further enhanced our liquidity position. The impact of the global economic slowdown on our 2009 operating results was also mitigated by the success of the strategic initiatives we announced in February 2009 which were aimed at strengthening our revenue, cost structure and cash flow, including: continuing our focus on consumer driven product development and innovation by introducing more than 50 new tires globally, including several branded mid tier product offerings. During 2009, we achieved our goal and introduced 62 new products, such as the Assurance Fuel Max in North America and the EfficientGrip tire with Fuel Saving Technology in Europe; achieving our four point cost savings plan target of $2.5 billion by increasing our continuous improvement efforts, lowering our manufacturing costs, increasing purchasing savings, eliminating non essential discretionary spending, and reducing overhead and development costs. We achieved approximately $730 million of cost savings in 2009. In association with this plan, we had personnel reductions of approximately 5,700 people in 2009; reducing manufacturing capacity by 15 million to 25 million units by February 2011. We have announced planned manufacturing capacity reductions of approximately 8 million units in 2009 (including the 45 Table of Contents discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and the closing of our Las Pinas, Philippines plant); reducing inventory levels by over $500 million by the end of 2009 compared with 2008. We exceeded this goal and have reduced inventories by $1,149 million from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009; adjusting planned capital expenditures to between $700 million and $800 million in 2009 from $1,049 million in 2008. Our capital expenditures were $746 million in 2009; and pursuing additional non core asset sales, including our decision to pursue offers for our European and Latin American farm tire business. We exceeded our inventory reduction goal through the combination of lower raw material costs and the implementation of an advantaged supply chain, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, by improving demand forecasting, increasing production flexibility through shorter lead times and reduced production lot sizes, reducing the quantity of raw materials required to meet an improved demand forecast, changing the composition of our logistics network by closing and consolidating certain distribution warehouses, increasing local production and reducing longer lead time off shore imports, and reducing in transit inventory between our plants and regional distribution centers. At December 31, 2009, we had $1,922 million in Cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1,894 million at December 31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by improvements in trade working capital of $1,081 million and proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $746 million, the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009 and the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due 2013. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $2,567 million and $1,671 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility due 2013 $ 892 $ 303 505 million revolving credit facility due 2012 712 508 China financing agreements 530 535 Other domestic and international debt 124 109 Notes payable and overdrafts 309 216 $ 2,567 $ 1,671 At December 31, 2009, our unused availability included approximately $530 million which can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. These financing arrangements along with government grants should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of these manufacturing facilities. There were no borrowings outstanding under these financing agreements at December 31, 2009. In 2010, we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $275 million to $325 million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $350 million and $375 million. The strategic initiatives described above are intended to permit us to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. In order to effectively extend the maturity date of a portion of our indebtedness coming due in 2011, in February 2010, we commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.857% Notes due 2011 for up to $702 million in aggregate principal amount of a new series of 8.75% Notes due 46 Table of Contents 2020. The completion of the exchange offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that we receive valid tenders, not validly withdrawn, of at least $260 million in aggregate principal of the 7.857% Notes due 2011. In addition, SRI has certain minority exit rights that, if triggered and exercised, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. As of the date of this filing, SRI has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable. Our ability to service debt and operational requirements are also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as Venezuela, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to various restrictions, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments restrict the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of overcoming these restrictions, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries that are subject to such restrictions to be integral to our liquidity or readily available to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2009, approximately $563 million of net assets were subject to such restrictions. At December 31, 2009, we had cash denominated in Venezuelan bolivares fuertes of $370 million (calculated at the December 31, 2009 official exchange rate of 2.15 bolivares fuertes to each U.S. dollar), third party U.S. dollar denominated accounts payable of $17 million, and U.S. dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable of $127 million. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy is considered a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of our financial statements are required to be recorded directly in the statement of operations. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and the establishment of a two tier exchange structure. As a result, we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of 2010 in connection with the remeasurement of our balance sheet to reflect the devaluation. If calculated at the new official exchange rate of 4.30 bolivares fuertes to each U.S. dollar, the charge is expected to be approximately $150 million, net of tax. If in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate, we may realize additional gains or losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations. Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2009. The devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and weak economic conditions are expected to adversely impact Latin American Tires operating results by $50 million to $75 million as compared to 2009. For further information regarding the Venezuelan currency devaluation and its anticipated impact on Goodyear, see Item 1. Business Recent Developments Venezuelan Currency Devaluation, and for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations, including Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2010 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. The challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of these challenges. Cash Position At December 31, 2009, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts: $352 million or 18% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Western Europe ($427 million or 23% at December 31, 2008), 47 Table of Contents $217 million or 11% in Asia, primarily Singapore, Australia and India ($311 million or 16% at December 31, 2008), and $533 million or 28% in Latin America, including $370 million in Venezuela ($298 million or 16% at December 31, 2008). Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operations was $1,297 million in 2009, compared to cash used of $739 million in 2008 and cash provided of $92 million in 2007. Cash flows in 2009 included a net cash inflow of $1,081 million for trade working capital, compared with net cash outflows of $127 million and $204 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2008 included the $1,007 million contribution made to the VEBA. Investing Activities Net cash used in continuing operations was $663 million in 2009, compared to $1,058 million in 2008 and $606 million in 2007. Capital expenditures were $746 million in 2009, compared to $1,049 million in 2008 and $739 million in 2007. The increase in capital expenditures in 2008 primarily related to projects targeted at increasing our capacity for high value added tires, which were scaled back in 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions. Investing cash flows included a cash inflow of $47 million and a net cash outflow of $76 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively related to The Reserve Primary Fund. Investing cash flows also reflect cash provided from the disposition of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs and the divestiture of non core assets. Investing cash flows provided by discontinued operations in 2007 of $1,435 million related primarily to the proceeds from the sale of our Engineered Products business. Financing Activities Net cash used in continuing operations was $654 million in 2009, compared to cash provided of $264 million in 2008 and cash used of $1,426 million in 2007. Financing cash flows in 2009 included the net proceeds from the issuance of our $1 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016, the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due 2013, and the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009. Consolidated debt at December 31, 2009 was $4,520 million, compared to $4,979 million at December 31, 2008. Financing cash flows in 2008 included outflows of $84 million for the acquisition of approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of our tire manufacturing subsidiary in Poland and the acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership in our tire manufacturing and distribution subsidiary in China. Non cash financing activities in 2007 included the issuance of 28.7 million shares of our common stock in exchange for approximately $346 million principal amount of our 4% convertible senior notes due 2034. Credit Sources In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $7,579 million available at December 31, 2009, of which $2,567 million were unused, compared to $7,127 million available at December 31, 2008, of which $1,671 million were unused. At December 31, 2009, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $7,046 million, of which $2,258 million were unused, compared to $6,646 million and $1,455 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $533 million, of which $309 million were unused, compared to $481 million and $216 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time. Outstanding Notes At December 31, 2009, we had $2,345 million of outstanding notes, compared to $1,882 million at December 31, 2008. 48 Table of Contents Certain of our notes were issued pursuant to indentures that contain varying covenants and other terms. In general, the terms of our indentures, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, under certain of our indentures, if the notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moodys and Standard Poors (SP) and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. On May 11, 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 10.5% senior notes due 2016. The senior notes were sold at 95.846% of the principal amount and will mature on May 15, 2016. The senior notes are our unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to Part I Business Recent Developments and to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. $1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013 Our amended and restated first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under the facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company (the Parent Company) and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors which are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $1.5 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2009, our borrowing base under this facility was $114 million below the stated amount of $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $494 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, we had $700 million outstanding and $497 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. $1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014 Our amended and restated second lien term loan facility is subject to the consent of the lenders making additional term loans, whereby, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $300 million. Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien credit facility. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, this facility was fully drawn. 505 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European and German Revolving Credit Facilities due 2012 Our amended and restated facilities consist of a 155 million German revolving credit facility, which is only available to certain of the German subsidiaries of GDTE (collectively, German borrowers) and a 350 million European revolving credit facility, which is available to the same German borrowers and to GDTE and certain of its other subsidiaries, with a 125 million sublimit for non German borrowers and a 50 million letter of credit sublimit. Goodyear and its subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. facilities provide unsecured guarantees to support the European 49 Table of Contents revolving credit facilities and GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany also provide guarantees. GDTEs obligations under the facilities and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in a variety of collateral. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings under the German revolving credit facility. Under the European revolving credit facility, there were no borrowings as of December 31, 2009 and there were $182 million (130 million) of borrowings, including $84 million (60 million) of borrowings by the non German borrowers, as of December 31, 2008. Letters of credit issued under the European revolving credit facility totaled $14 million (10 million) as of December 31, 2009 and $16 million (11 million) as of December 31, 2008. Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European and German revolving credit facilities have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our financial condition since December 31, 2006. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to Covenant Compliance below and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet) GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a pan European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides up to 450 million of funding and expires in 2015. Utilization under this facility is based on current available receivable balances. The facility is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity commitments. The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. It is an event of default under the facility if the ratio of GDTEs consolidated net indebtedness to its consolidated EBITDA is greater than 3.0 to 1.0. This financial covenant is substantially similar to the covenant included in the European credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount available and fully utilized under this program totaled $437 million (304 million) and $483 million (346 million), respectively. The program did not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in long term debt and capital leases. In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have accounts receivable securitization programs totaling $68 million and $61 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. These amounts are included in Notes payable and overdrafts. Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet) Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2009 and 2008. The receivable financing programs of these subsidiaries did not utilize a special purpose entity (SPE). At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the gross amount of receivables sold was $113 million and $116 million, respectively. Other Foreign Credit Facilities Our credit facilities in China provide for availability of up to 3.66 billion renminbi (approximately $530 million and $535 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively) and can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Covenant Compliance Our amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, make certain restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or 50 Table of Contents otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. We have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows: We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company and Guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (Available Cash) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $150 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2009, our availability under this facility of $892 million, plus our Available Cash of $819 million, totaled $1.7 billion, which is in excess of $150 million. We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0. In addition, our 505 million senior secured European and German revolving credit facilities contain non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTEs ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined, through March 31, 2011, net of the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, (2) cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and (3) availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. There are no known future changes or new covenants to any of our existing debt obligations. Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities. The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness, Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness and Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities. EBITDA (per our Amended and Restated Credit Facilities) If the amount of availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our Available Cash (as defined in that facility) is less than $150 million, we may not permit our ratio of EBITDA (as defined in that facility) (Covenant EBITDA) to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in that facility) to be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Since our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our Available Cash is in excess of $150 million, this financial covenant is not currently applicable. Our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of Covenant EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above. We believe that 51 Table of Contents these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test. Covenant EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure of limitations imposed under our credit facilities. Covenant EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to either (i) income from operations or (ii) cash flows from operating activities. Our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. Limitations on our ability to incur debt in accordance with our credit facilities could affect our liquidity, and we believe that the presentation of Covenant EBITDA provides investors with important information. The following table presents the calculation of EBITDA and the calculation of Covenant EBITDA in accordance with the definitions in our amended and restated credit facilities for the periods indicated. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do. Certain line items are presented as defined in the credit facilities and do not reflect amounts as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those line items also include discontinued operations. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Goodyear Net (Loss) Income $ (375 ) $ (77 ) $ 583 Interest Expense 311 320 470 United States and Foreign Taxes 7 209 296 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 636 660 623 EBITDA 579 1,112 1,972 Credit Facilities Adjustments: Other Adjustments to Goodyear Net (Loss) Income(1) 71 (462 ) Minority Interest in Net Income of Subsidiaries 11 54 71 Other Non Cash Items 37 85 51 Capitalized Interest and Other Interest Related Expense 38 31 18 Rationalization Charges 16 93 61 Covenant EBITDA $ 752 $ 1,375 $ 1,711 (1) In 2009 other adjustments primarily include the sale of certain properties in Akron, Ohio. In 2007, other adjustments primarily include a $542 million pre tax gain on the sale of our Engineered Products business. Potential Future Financings In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt. Dividends Under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied. Asset Dispositions The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions. 52 Table of Contents COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2009: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2009 (In millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Beyond 2014 Debt Obligations(1) $ 4,502 $ 335 $ 986 $ 93 $ 23 $ 1,207 $ 1,858 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 18 3 3 3 9 Interest Payments(3) 1,401 279 252 189 185 166 330 Operating Leases(4) 1,361 302 254 197 152 108 348 Pension Benefits(5) 2,702 350 588 713 563 488 N/A Other Postretirement Benefits(6) 464 57 55 52 49 46 205 Workers Compensation(7) 404 75 51 38 29 23 188 Binding Commitments(8) 1,382 1,237 108 17 11 5 4 Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9) 66 35 4 26 1 $ 12,300 $ 2,673 $ 2,301 $ 1,328 $ 1,021 $ 2,043 $ 2,934 (1) Debt obligations include Notes payable and overdrafts. (2) The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations is $23 million. (3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2009 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. (4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $43 million, $33 million, $24 million, $18 million, $9 million, and $10 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $137 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,224 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $898 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2009. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table for 2010, 2011 and 2012 represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law; and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non U.S. pension plans. For years after 2012, the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non U.S. pension plans, and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including: Projected Target Liability interest rate of 6.60% for 2010, 6.15% for 2011, 5.63% for 2012, 5.79% for 2013 and 5.94% for 2014, and plan asset returns of 8.5% for 2010 and beyond. Future contributions are also affected by other factors such as: future interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, 53 Table of Contents how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions, and any changes to current law which would grant additional funding relief for defined benefit plan sponsors. (6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. (7) The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $301 million. (8) Binding commitments are for raw materials and investments in land, buildings and equipment. (9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2009. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters. Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the global alliance agreements between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements. SRIs exit rights, in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase minimum amounts of various raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our production levels. We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. 54 Table of Contents We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $40 million at December 31, 2009 and expire at various times through 2023. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position.

Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including: deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity; if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected; we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline; our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expenses; higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business; continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may materially adversely affect our business; if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected; our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results; the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations; we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health; any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations; our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner; our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly; we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales; we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims; our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded; 55 Table of Contents we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity; we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results; our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of those interests. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Commodity Price Risk The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power and expand our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials. Interest Rate Risk We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps. We will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates, and are normally designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions. At December 31, 2009, 44% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 3.13% compared to 68% at an average rate of 3.83% at December 31, 2008. We also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances. We may also enter into interest rate contracts that change the basis of our floating interest rate exposure. There were no interest rate contracts at December 31, 2009. There was one such interest rate contract outstanding at December 31, 2008. In October 2008, we entered into a basis swap contract under which we paid six month LIBOR and received one month LIBOR plus a premium. The notional principal amount of the swap was $1.2 billion and it matured in October 2009. During 2009, the weighted average interest rates paid and received were 2.35% and 0.83%, respectively. During 2008, the weighted average interest rates paid and received were 3.48% and 2.60%, respectively. Fair value gains and losses on the contract are recorded in Other Expense. The fair value of the contract at December 31, 2008 was a liability of $10 million. 56 Table of Contents The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Carrying amount liability $ 2,442 $ 1,514 Fair value liability 2,532 1,207 Pro forma fair value liability 2,601 1,241 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. Foreign currency forward and option contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements, and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Fair value asset (liability) $22 $(23) Pro forma decrease in fair value (106) (106) Contract maturities 1/10 10/19 1/09 10/19 The pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models. Fair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 Asset (liability): Accounts receivable $ 27 $ 3 Other Assets 1 1 Other current liabilities (6 ) (27 ) The counterparties to our interest rate and foreign exchange contracts were substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks or other financial institutions that are recognized market makers. We control our credit exposure by diversifying across multiple counterparties and by setting counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of counterparty credit risk such as credit default swap spreads. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. Based on our analysis, we consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts to be remote. However, the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its obligations when due could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the period in which it occurs. For further information on interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 57 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview in this Form 10 K. 2008 Compared to 2007 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2008 decreased 1.8 million units or 8.3% from the 2007 period. Replacement volume decreased 0.8 million units or 5.8% primarily in the commercial market due to an overall decline in industry volumes, while OE volume decreased 1.0 million units or 13.4% primarily in the consumer market. Net sales in 2008 increased $216 million or 11.5% from the 2007 period. Net sales increased in 2008 due to favorable price and product mix of $237 million, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, mainly in Brazil, of approximately $85 million, and higher sales of other tire related businesses of $47 million. Partially offsetting these increases was lower volume of $152 million. Operating income in 2008 increased $8 million or 2.2% from the same period in 2007. Favorably impacting operating income were price and product mix of $214 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs 43 Table of Contents of $109 million, and foreign currency translation of $17 million. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher conversion costs of $57 million, decreased volume of $41 million, increased transportation costs of $12 million, increased tire recycling fees, duties and other charges of $9 million, and increased SAG expenses of $5 million, primarily related to advertising expenses. The higher conversion costs related primarily to under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $20 million due to reduced production volume in the fourth quarter of 2008 and higher utility and engineering costs. Operating income in 2008 also included a gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a transactional excise tax case. Operating income excludes net rationalization charges totaling $4 million in 2008 and $2 million in 2007. Operating income also excludes gains on asset sales of $5 million in 2008 and $1 million in 2007. Operating income in 2008 excludes a $16 million loss primarily due to the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses on the liquidation of our subsidiary in Jamaica. Asia Pacific Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Tire Units 19.2 19.8 19.0 Net Sales $ 1,709 $ 1,829 $ 1,693 Operating Income 210 168 150 Operating Margin 12.3 % 9.2 % 8.9 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 0.6 million units or 2.9% from the 2008 period. Replacement unit sales decreased 0.8 million units or 6.3%, while OE volumes increased 0.2 million units or 3.4%, primarily in the consumer business. The net decrease in units is due to continuing recessionary economic conditions, primarily in Australia, that were partially offset by increased growth in vehicle production in China. Net sales in 2009 decreased $120 million or 6.6% compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $88 million, lower volume of $48 million and decreased sales in other tire related businesses of $12 million, primarily in the retail business. Net sales were favorably affected by improved price and product mix of $28 million. Operating income in 2009 increased $42 million or 25.0% compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to improved price and mix of $38 million, lower raw material costs of $30 million and decreased conversion costs of $6 million. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $12 million, partially offset by $7 million of under absorbed fixed overhead costs due to reduced production volume. Operating income in 2009 included a gain of $7 million from insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2007. Operating income was adversely affected by lower volume of $13 million, decreased operating income in other tire related businesses of $8 million, and increases in incentive compensation expense of $9 million and in the cost of imported finished tires of $6 million. Operating income in 2009 and 2008 excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs of $26 million and $24 million, and net rationalization charges of $10 million and $83 million, respectively, primarily related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Las Pinas, Philippines and Somerton, Australia. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and $10 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 45% and 47% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. 44 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2008 increased 0.8 million units or 4.1% from the 2007 period. Replacement unit sales increased 0.2 million units or 1.8% and OE volume increased 0.6 million units or 8.6%. The increase in OE volume in 2008 relates primarily to supply constraints in 2007 due to the Thailand fire. Net sales in 2008 increased $136 million or 8.0% compared to the 2007 period due to favorable price and product mix of $71 million, increased volume of $55 million, and favorable foreign currency translation of $7 million. Operating income in 2008 increased $18 million or 12.0% compared to the 2007 period due to improved price and product mix of $107 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs of $84 million, increased volume of $14 million and increased operating income in other tire related businesses of $8 million primarily due to improved results in our company owned retail businesses in Australia. Unfavorably impacting operating income was increased conversion costs of $26 million. The higher conversion costs related primarily to under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $10 million due to reduced production volume in the fourth quarter of 2008, inflation and higher utility and engineering costs. Operating income excludes net rationalization charges totaling $83 million in 2008 and $1 million in 2007 and gains on assets sales of $10 million in 2008 and $8 million in 2007. Operating income in 2007 also excludes a $12 million loss, net of insurance proceeds, as a result of the Thailand fire. In addition, operating income in 2008 excludes approximately $24 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Somerton, Australia facility. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We experienced challenging industry conditions throughout 2009 due to recessionary economic conditions in many parts of the world during the first half of 2009 and a slow and uncertain recovery from those conditions in the second half of 2009. These industry conditions were characterized by lower motor vehicle sales and production and weakness in the demand for replacement tires, particularly in the commercial markets, compared to 2008. Given the difficult economic environment and the uncertainty in the capital markets, we took several actions to strengthen our liquidity in 2009, including strong working capital management. We also successfully completed a $1.0 billion senior unsecured notes offering in the second quarter of 2009 that addressed a December 2009 debt maturity and further enhanced our liquidity position. The impact of the global economic slowdown on our 2009 operating results was also mitigated by the success of the strategic initiatives we announced in February 2009 which were aimed at strengthening our revenue, cost structure and cash flow, including: continuing our focus on consumer driven product development and innovation by introducing more than 50 new tires globally, including several branded mid tier product offerings. During 2009, we achieved our goal and introduced 62 new products, such as the Assurance Fuel Max in North America and the EfficientGrip tire with Fuel Saving Technology in Europe; achieving our four point cost savings plan target of $2.5 billion by increasing our continuous improvement efforts, lowering our manufacturing costs, increasing purchasing savings, eliminating non essential discretionary spending, and reducing overhead and development costs. We achieved approximately $730 million of cost savings in 2009. In association with this plan, we had personnel reductions of approximately 5,700 people in 2009; reducing manufacturing capacity by 15 million to 25 million units by February 2011. We have announced planned manufacturing capacity reductions of approximately 8 million units in 2009 (including the 45 Table of Contents discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and the closing of our Las Pinas, Philippines plant); reducing inventory levels by over $500 million by the end of 2009 compared with 2008. We exceeded this goal and have reduced inventories by $1,149 million from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009; adjusting planned capital expenditures to between $700 million and $800 million in 2009 from $1,049 million in 2008. Our capital expenditures were $746 million in 2009; and pursuing additional non core asset sales, including our decision to pursue offers for our European and Latin American farm tire business. We exceeded our inventory reduction goal through the combination of lower raw material costs and the implementation of an advantaged supply chain, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, by improving demand forecasting, increasing production flexibility through shorter lead times and reduced production lot sizes, reducing the quantity of raw materials required to meet an improved demand forecast, changing the composition of our logistics network by closing and consolidating certain distribution warehouses, increasing local production and reducing longer lead time off shore imports, and reducing in transit inventory between our plants and regional distribution centers. At December 31, 2009, we had $1,922 million in Cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1,894 million at December 31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by improvements in trade working capital of $1,081 million and proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $746 million, the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009 and the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due 2013. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $2,567 million and $1,671 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility due 2013 $ 892 $ 303 505 million revolving credit facility due 2012 712 508 China financing agreements 530 535 Other domestic and international debt 124 109 Notes payable and overdrafts 309 216 $ 2,567 $ 1,671 At December 31, 2009, our unused availability included approximately $530 million which can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. These financing arrangements along with government grants should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of these manufacturing facilities. There were no borrowings outstanding under these financing agreements at December 31, 2009. In 2010, we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $275 million to $325 million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $350 million and $375 million. The strategic initiatives described above are intended to permit us to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. In order to effectively extend the maturity date of a portion of our indebtedness coming due in 2011, in February 2010, we commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.857% Notes due 2011 for up to $702 million in aggregate principal amount of a new series of 8.75% Notes due 46 Table of Contents 2020. The completion of the exchange offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that we receive valid tenders, not validly withdrawn, of at least $260 million in aggregate principal of the 7.857% Notes due 2011. In addition, SRI has certain minority exit rights that, if triggered and exercised, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. As of the date of this filing, SRI has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable. Our ability to service debt and operational requirements are also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as Venezuela, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to various restrictions, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments restrict the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of overcoming these restrictions, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries that are subject to such restrictions to be integral to our liquidity or readily available to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2009, approximately $563 million of net assets were subject to such restrictions. At December 31, 2009, we had cash denominated in Venezuelan bolivares fuertes of $370 million (calculated at the December 31, 2009 official exchange rate of 2.15 bolivares fuertes to each U.S. dollar), third party U.S. dollar denominated accounts payable of $17 million, and U.S. dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable of $127 million. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy is considered a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of our financial statements are required to be recorded directly in the statement of operations. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and the establishment of a two tier exchange structure. As a result, we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of 2010 in connection with the remeasurement of our balance sheet to reflect the devaluation. If calculated at the new official exchange rate of 4.30 bolivares fuertes to each U.S. dollar, the charge is expected to be approximately $150 million, net of tax. If in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate, we may realize additional gains or losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations. Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2009. The devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and weak economic conditions are expected to adversely impact Latin American Tires operating results by $50 million to $75 million as compared to 2009. For further information regarding the Venezuelan currency devaluation and its anticipated impact on Goodyear, see Item 1. Business Recent Developments Venezuelan Currency Devaluation, and for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations, including Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2010 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. The challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of these challenges. Cash Position At December 31, 2009, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts: $352 million or 18% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Western Europe ($427 million or 23% at December 31, 2008), 47 Table of Contents $217 million or 11% in Asia, primarily Singapore, Australia and India ($311 million or 16% at December 31, 2008), and $533 million or 28% in Latin America, including $370 million in Venezuela ($298 million or 16% at December 31, 2008). Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operations was $1,297 million in 2009, compared to cash used of $739 million in 2008 and cash provided of $92 million in 2007. Cash flows in 2009 included a net cash inflow of $1,081 million for trade working capital, compared with net cash outflows of $127 million and $204 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2008 included the $1,007 million contribution made to the VEBA. Investing Activities Net cash used in continuing operations was $663 million in 2009, compared to $1,058 million in 2008 and $606 million in 2007. Capital expenditures were $746 million in 2009, compared to $1,049 million in 2008 and $739 million in 2007. The increase in capital expenditures in 2008 primarily related to projects targeted at increasing our capacity for high value added tires, which were scaled back in 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions. Investing cash flows included a cash inflow of $47 million and a net cash outflow of $76 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively related to The Reserve Primary Fund. Investing cash flows also reflect cash provided from the disposition of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs and the divestiture of non core assets. Investing cash flows provided by discontinued operations in 2007 of $1,435 million related primarily to the proceeds from the sale of our Engineered Products business. Financing Activities Net cash used in continuing operations was $654 million in 2009, compared to cash provided of $264 million in 2008 and cash used of $1,426 million in 2007. Financing cash flows in 2009 included the net proceeds from the issuance of our $1 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016, the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility due 2013, and the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009. Consolidated debt at December 31, 2009 was $4,520 million, compared to $4,979 million at December 31, 2008. Financing cash flows in 2008 included outflows of $84 million for the acquisition of approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of our tire manufacturing subsidiary in Poland and the acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership in our tire manufacturing and distribution subsidiary in China. Non cash financing activities in 2007 included the issuance of 28.7 million shares of our common stock in exchange for approximately $346 million principal amount of our 4% convertible senior notes due 2034. Credit Sources In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $7,579 million available at December 31, 2009, of which $2,567 million were unused, compared to $7,127 million available at December 31, 2008, of which $1,671 million were unused. At December 31, 2009, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $7,046 million, of which $2,258 million were unused, compared to $6,646 million and $1,455 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $533 million, of which $309 million were unused, compared to $481 million and $216 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time. Outstanding Notes At December 31, 2009, we had $2,345 million of outstanding notes, compared to $1,882 million at December 31, 2008. 48 Table of Contents Certain of our notes were issued pursuant to indentures that contain varying covenants and other terms. In general, the terms of our indentures, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, under certain of our indentures, if the notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moodys and Standard Poors (SP) and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. On May 11, 2009, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 10.5% senior notes due 2016. The senior notes were sold at 95.846% of the principal amount and will mature on May 15, 2016. The senior notes are our unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to Part I Business Recent Developments and to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. $1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013 Our amended and restated first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under the facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company (the Parent Company) and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors which are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $1.5 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2009, our borrowing base under this facility was $114 million below the stated amount of $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $494 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, we had $700 million outstanding and $497 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. $1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014 Our amended and restated second lien term loan facility is subject to the consent of the lenders making additional term loans, whereby, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $300 million. Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien credit facility. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, this facility was fully drawn. 505 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European and German Revolving Credit Facilities due 2012 Our amended and restated facilities consist of a 155 million German revolving credit facility, which is only available to certain of the German subsidiaries of GDTE (collectively, German borrowers) and a 350 million European revolving credit facility, which is available to the same German borrowers and to GDTE and certain of its other subsidiaries, with a 125 million sublimit for non German borrowers and a 50 million letter of credit sublimit. Goodyear and its subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. facilities provide unsecured guarantees to support the European 49 Table of Contents revolving credit facilities and GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany also provide guarantees. GDTEs obligations under the facilities and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in a variety of collateral. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings under the German revolving credit facility. Under the European revolving credit facility, there were no borrowings as of December 31, 2009 and there were $182 million (130 million) of borrowings, including $84 million (60 million) of borrowings by the non German borrowers, as of December 31, 2008. Letters of credit issued under the European revolving credit facility totaled $14 million (10 million) as of December 31, 2009 and $16 million (11 million) as of December 31, 2008. Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European and German revolving credit facilities have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our financial condition since December 31, 2006. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to Covenant Compliance below and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet) GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a pan European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides up to 450 million of funding and expires in 2015. Utilization under this facility is based on current available receivable balances. The facility is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity commitments. The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. It is an event of default under the facility if the ratio of GDTEs consolidated net indebtedness to its consolidated EBITDA is greater than 3.0 to 1.0. This financial covenant is substantially similar to the covenant included in the European credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount available and fully utilized under this program totaled $437 million (304 million) and $483 million (346 million), respectively. The program did not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in long term debt and capital leases. In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have accounts receivable securitization programs totaling $68 million and $61 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. These amounts are included in Notes payable and overdrafts. Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet) Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2009 and 2008. The receivable financing programs of these subsidiaries did not utilize a special purpose entity (SPE). At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the gross amount of receivables sold was $113 million and $116 million, respectively. Other Foreign Credit Facilities Our credit facilities in China provide for availability of up to 3.66 billion renminbi (approximately $530 million and $535 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively) and can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Covenant Compliance Our amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, make certain restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or 50 Table of Contents otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. We have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows: We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company and Guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (Available Cash) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $150 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2009, our availability under this facility of $892 million, plus our Available Cash of $819 million, totaled $1.7 billion, which is in excess of $150 million. We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0. In addition, our 505 million senior secured European and German revolving credit facilities contain non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTEs ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined, through March 31, 2011, net of the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, (2) cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and (3) availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. There are no known future changes or new covenants to any of our existing debt obligations. Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities. The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness, Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness and Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities. EBITDA (per our Amended and Restated Credit Facilities) If the amount of availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our Available Cash (as defined in that facility) is less than $150 million, we may not permit our ratio of EBITDA (as defined in that facility) (Covenant EBITDA) to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in that facility) to be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Since our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility plus our Available Cash is in excess of $150 million, this financial covenant is not currently applicable. Our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of Covenant EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above. We believe that 51 Table of Contents these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test. Covenant EBITDA is a non GAAP financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure of limitations imposed under our credit facilities. Covenant EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to either (i) income from operations or (ii) cash flows from operating activities. Our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. Limitations on our ability to incur debt in accordance with our credit facilities could affect our liquidity, and we believe that the presentation of Covenant EBITDA provides investors with important information. The following table presents the calculation of EBITDA and the calculation of Covenant EBITDA in accordance with the definitions in our amended and restated credit facilities for the periods indicated. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do. Certain line items are presented as defined in the credit facilities and do not reflect amounts as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those line items also include discontinued operations. Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Goodyear Net (Loss) Income $ (375 ) $ (77 ) $ 583 Interest Expense 311 320 470 United States and Foreign Taxes 7 209 296 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 636 660 623 EBITDA 579 1,112 1,972 Credit Facilities Adjustments: Other Adjustments to Goodyear Net (Loss) Income(1) 71 (462 ) Minority Interest in Net Income of Subsidiaries 11 54 71 Other Non Cash Items 37 85 51 Capitalized Interest and Other Interest Related Expense 38 31 18 Rationalization Charges 16 93 61 Covenant EBITDA $ 752 $ 1,375 $ 1,711 (1) In 2009 other adjustments primarily include the sale of certain properties in Akron, Ohio. In 2007, other adjustments primarily include a $542 million pre tax gain on the sale of our Engineered Products business. Potential Future Financings In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or a capital markets transaction, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt. Dividends Under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied. Asset Dispositions The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions. 52 Table of Contents COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2009: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2009 (In millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Beyond 2014 Debt Obligations(1) $ 4,502 $ 335 $ 986 $ 93 $ 23 $ 1,207 $ 1,858 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 18 3 3 3 9 Interest Payments(3) 1,401 279 252 189 185 166 330 Operating Leases(4) 1,361 302 254 197 152 108 348 Pension Benefits(5) 2,702 350 588 713 563 488 N/A Other Postretirement Benefits(6) 464 57 55 52 49 46 205 Workers Compensation(7) 404 75 51 38 29 23 188 Binding Commitments(8) 1,382 1,237 108 17 11 5 4 Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9) 66 35 4 26 1 $ 12,300 $ 2,673 $ 2,301 $ 1,328 $ 1,021 $ 2,043 $ 2,934 (1) Debt obligations include Notes payable and overdrafts. (2) The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations is $23 million. (3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2009 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. (4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $43 million, $33 million, $24 million, $18 million, $9 million, and $10 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $137 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,224 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $898 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2009. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table for 2010, 2011 and 2012 represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law; and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non U.S. pension plans. For years after 2012, the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our domestic defined benefit pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our domestic and non U.S. pension plans, and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our domestic plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including: Projected Target Liability interest rate of 6.60% for 2010, 6.15% for 2011, 5.63% for 2012, 5.79% for 2013 and 5.94% for 2014, and plan asset returns of 8.5% for 2010 and beyond. Future contributions are also affected by other factors such as: future interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, 53 Table of Contents how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions, and any changes to current law which would grant additional funding relief for defined benefit plan sponsors. (6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. (7) The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $301 million. (8) Binding commitments are for raw materials and investments in land, buildings and equipment. (9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2009. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters. Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the global alliance agreements between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements. SRIs exit rights, in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase minimum amounts of various raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that are subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our production levels. We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. 54 Table of Contents We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $40 million at December 31, 2009 and expire at various times through 2023. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 20, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words estimate, expect, intend and project, as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10 K. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including: deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity; if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected; we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline; our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expenses; higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business; continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may materially adversely affect our business; if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected; our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results; the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations; we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health; any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations; our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner; our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly; we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales; we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims; our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded; 55 Table of Contents we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity; we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results; our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of those interests. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Commodity Price Risk The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power and expand our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials. Interest Rate Risk We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps. We will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates, and are normally designated as cash flow hedges. Floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates, and are normally designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions. At December 31, 2009, 44% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 3.13% compared to 68% at an average rate of 3.83% at December 31, 2008. We also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances. We may also enter into interest rate contracts that change the basis of our floating interest rate exposure. There were no interest rate contracts at December 31, 2009. There was one such interest rate contract outstanding at December 31, 2008. In October 2008, we entered into a basis swap contract under which we paid six month LIBOR and received one month LIBOR plus a premium. The notional principal amount of the swap was $1.2 billion and it matured in October 2009. During 2009, the weighted average interest rates paid and received were 2.35% and 0.83%, respectively. During 2008, the weighted average interest rates paid and received were 3.48% and 2.60%, respectively. Fair value gains and losses on the contract are recorded in Other Expense. The fair value of the contract at December 31, 2008 was a liability of $10 million. 56 Table of Contents The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Carrying amount liability $ 2,442 $ 1,514 Fair value liability 2,532 1,207 Pro forma fair value liability 2,601 1,241 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. Foreign currency forward and option contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements, and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31: (In millions) 2009 2008 Fair value asset (liability) $22 $(23) Pro forma decrease in fair value (106) (106) Contract maturities 1/10 10/19 1/09 10/19 The pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models. Fair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 Asset (liability): Accounts receivable $ 27 $ 3 Other Assets 1 1 Other current liabilities (6 ) (27 ) The counterparties to our interest rate and foreign exchange contracts were substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks or other financial institutions that are recognized market makers. We control our credit exposure by diversifying across multiple counterparties and by setting counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of counterparty credit risk such as credit default swap spreads. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. Based on our analysis, we consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts to be remote. However, the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its obligations when due could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the period in which it occurs.
