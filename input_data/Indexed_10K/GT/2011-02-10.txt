ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OVERVIEW The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 56 manufacturing facilities in 22 countries, including the United States. We operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: North American Tire; Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire (EMEA); Latin American Tire; and Asia Pacific Tire. We faced an uncertain business environment in 2010 as the global economy continued its recovery from the recessionary economic conditions that existed in many parts of the world during 2008 and 2009, particularly in North America and Europe. We also faced a number of substantial challenges, such as rapidly rising raw material and energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations, and the devaluation of the currency and economic weakness in Venezuela. Global tire industry demand, while improving, continues to be below pre recessionary levels in North America and remains hard to predict, especially for OE production. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Goodyear net loss was $216 million, compared to a Goodyear net loss of $375 million in 2009. Our total segment operating income for 2010 was $917 million, compared to $372 million in 2009. The increase in segment operating income was due primarily to a significant decrease in under absorbed fixed overhead costs, an increase in tire volume and strong price and product mix which more than offset raw material costs. See Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information. Net sales were $18.8 billion in 2010, compared to $16.3 billion in 2009. Net sales increased due to higher tire volume, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, an increase in other tire related businesses, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products, and improved product mix. We acted to address the uncertain economic environment and the challenges described above by implementing strategic initiatives aimed at permitting us to take advantage of improving economic conditions and to emerge stronger in the future. Under those strategic initiatives we planned to: Continue to focus on consumer driven product development by launching a significant number of new and innovative products; Take a selective approach to the market, targeting profitable segments where we have competitive advantage; Focus on price and product mix improvements to address rising raw material costs; Achieve cost reductions of $1.0 billion over three years from 2010 to 2012; Reduce our high cost capacity by 15 to 25 million units; Focus on cash flow to provide funding for investments in future growth; Create an advantaged supply chain focused on optimizing inventory levels and further improving customer service; and Improve our manufacturing efficiency, including recovering unabsorbed fixed costs incurred during the recession. We met, and frequently exceeded, our financial and operating goals for 2010, including the following key achievements: Nearly 60 successful new product launches thereby increasing the percentage of our sales coming from recently launched products; 28 Table of Contents Price and product mix improvements of $689 million, which helped to offset $685 million of raw material cost increases, exclusive of approximately $136 million of raw material cost savings included in our cost savings described below; Cost savings of $467 million, which included savings from continuous improvement initiatives, including savings under our USW agreement, increased low cost country sourcing, and initiatives to reduce raw material costs and selling, administrative and general expense; Recovery of unabsorbed fixed costs of approximately $278 million compared to 2009; Continued progress on actions to reduce our high cost manufacturing capacity, including the announced closure of our factory in Union City, Tennessee, which brings our announced manufacturing capacity reductions to approximately 21 million units and will achieve our goal of reducing high cost capacity by 15 to 25 million units; Significant progress on manufacturing investments in Oklahoma, Chile and China; Further improvements in working capital through strong inventory management, improved vendor terms and good collections at year end; and The successful completion of a $1.0 billion debt offering in August 2010 that addressed our 2011 debt maturities and further enhanced our liquidity position. Pension and Benefit Plans During 2010, our U.S. pension fund experienced market gains, which increased plan assets by $473 million and decreased net actuarial losses included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) by $193 million. As a result, annual U.S. net periodic pension cost will decrease to approximately $175 million to $200 million in 2011 from $219 million in 2010, due primarily to expected returns on higher plan assets. Liquidity At December 31, 2010, we had $2,005 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $2,475 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $1,922 million and $2,567 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the reduced net loss compared to 2009, improvements in trade working capital of $52 million and proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 8.25% senior notes due 2020. Partially offsetting these increases in Cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $944 million and the redemption of $973 million of outstanding notes, including $713 million of notes due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in 2011 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. New Products In 2010, we successfully launched our new Goodyear Assurance ComforTred Touring tire in North American Tire. We also announced the launch of 12 new and retread product lines in our commercial truck tire business with seven of those lines featuring Fuel Max and Duraseal Technology. At our North American Tire dealer conference in early 2011, we introduced several key products, most notably the Goodyear Assurance TripleTred All Season tire and our new Eagle F1 Asymmetric 2 tire. Additionally, we are adding key sizes of new consumer products launched in recent years. In Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, we introduced the Dunlop StreetResponse and the QuatroMaxx. We also introduced the UG Ice + targeting the Nordic and Russian markets. In addition, we launched our Goodyear Fuel Max Trailer tires. In Latin American Tire, we successfully developed the Fuel Max Technology for consumer through the GPS Duraplus product line. We also introduced the Eagle Excellence with Aquamax Technology and the Viva product line. The new G665 Plus for city service applications was introduced in the commercial line. 29 Table of Contents In Asia Pacific Tire, we launched the Eagle EfficientGrip and Assurance Fuel Max tires and re launched the Wrangler AT/SA with improved wear performance to meet the demand of the growing SUV segment. Outlook We expect 2011 to be a year of continued recovery. We will face challenges related primarily to raw material costs and the significant actions we are taking globally to improve our manufacturing footprint. We expect the global tire industry to continue to grow in 2011, with volume expansion across all regions and major segments. In North America, consumer replacement is expected to grow between 1% and 3%, consumer OE between 5% and 10%, commercial replacement between 3% and 8% and commercial OE between 20% and 30%. We anticipate our North American consumer OE volumes will increase at less than the industry rate, given actions we have taken to be more selective in our OE fitments. In Europe, consumer replacement is expected to grow between 1% and 3%, consumer OE between 0% and 5%, commercial replacement between 5% and 10% and commercial OE between 30% and 40%. Overall, we expect our unit sales will increase by 3% to 5% in 2011 as we continue to grow in targeted segments. We expect our raw material costs in the first quarter of 2011 to increase 25% to 30% when compared with the first quarter of 2010. Similar increases are expected for the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. We expect raw material costs to peak in the third quarter of 2011. In order to mitigate some of the impact of rapidly rising natural rubber prices, we are continuing to focus on price and product mix, to substitute synthetic rubber for natural rubber where possible and to work to identify additional substitution opportunities, to reduce the amount of natural rubber required in each tire, and to pursue alternative raw materials including innovative bio based materials. However, during periods of rapidly rising raw material costs, we may not be able to fully offset those raw material cost increases through the use of these strategies, although we remain confident in our ability to do so over the longer term. We expect unabsorbed fixed cost recovery and our cost savings program to contribute approximately $1.0 billion to our operating results in 2011 and 2012 compared to 2010. As a result of increased production and our planned manufacturing footprint reductions in Tennessee and France, we expect to recover approximately $175 million of unabsorbed fixed costs in 2011 and approximately $295 million in 2012. We also expect to reduce costs by more than $500 million in 2011 and 2012, with approximately half of the savings realized in each year. As a partial offset to these benefits, we expect to incur approximately $30 million to $40 million of additional costs related to start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in China in 2011.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED All per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net loss. 2010 Compared to 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2010, Goodyear net loss was $216 million, or $0.89 per share, compared to $375 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2009. Net Sales Net sales in 2010 of $18.8 billion increased $2.5 billion, or 15.5%, compared to 2009 due primarily to increased tire volume of $1,044 million, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, $867 million due to favorable changes in price and product mix, and increased sales in other tire related businesses of $582 million, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2010 were $10.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2009 were $9.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. 30 Table of Contents The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, (In millions of tires) 2010 2009 % Change Replacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 50.8 50.0 1.4 % International 82.2 78.0 5.3 % Total 133.0 128.0 3.9 % OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 15.9 12.7 25.4 % International 31.9 26.3 21.3 % Total 47.8 39.0 22.5 % Goodyear worldwide tire units 180.8 167.0 8.2 % The increase in worldwide tire unit sales of 13.8 million units, or 8.2%, compared to 2009, included an increase of 8.8 million OE units, or 22.5%, due primarily to increases in the consumer markets in North American Tire and EMEA due to improved economic conditions resulting in higher demand for new vehicles, and an increase of 5.0 million units, or 3.9%, in replacement units, primarily in EMEA. EMEA replacement volume increased 2.8 million units, or 5.2%, primarily in consumer, and Latin American Tire replacement volume increased 0.9 million units, or 6.7%, due to improved economic conditions in Europe and Latin America. Consumer and commercial units in 2010 were 164.4 million and 14.0 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial units in 2009 were 152.9 million and 12.2 million, respectively. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold (CGS) was $15.5 billion in 2010, increasing $1.8 billion, or 13.0%, compared to 2009. CGS in 2010 increased due primarily to higher tire volume of $850 million, mainly in North American Tire and EMEA, higher raw material costs of $549 million, higher costs in other tire related businesses of $529 million, primarily in North American Tires cost of chemical products, and product mix related manufacturing cost increases of $178 million. CGS was favorably impacted by decreased conversion costs of $295 million, due primarily to lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $278 million due to higher production volume. CGS benefited from savings from rationalization plans of $91 million. CGS in 2010 included charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $15 million ($11 million after tax or $0.05 per share), compared to $43 million in 2009 ($38 million after tax or $0.16 per share). CGS in 2010 also included gains from supplier settlements of $12 million ($8 million after tax or $0.03 per share), expense due to a supplier disruption of $4 million ($4 million after tax or $0.02 per share), a one time importation cost adjustment of $3 million ($3 million after tax or $0.01 per share), and the impact of a strike in South Africa of $3 million ($3 million after tax or $0.01 per share). CGS was 82.1% of sales in 2010 compared to 83.9% in 2009. Selling, Administrative and General Expense Selling, administrative and general expense (SAG) was $2.6 billion in 2010, increasing $226 million, or 9.4%, compared to 2009. SAG increased due primarily to increased wages and benefits of $103 million, including $63 million of incentive compensation, higher advertising expenses of $47 million, and increased warehousing costs of $17 million. SAG benefited from savings from rationalization plans of $18 million and an insurance recovery of $8 million ($8 million after tax or $0.03 per share). SAG in 2010 was 14.0% of sales, compared to 14.7% in 2009. Rationalizations To maintain global competitiveness, we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years to reduce excess and high cost manufacturing capacity and to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses 31 Table of Contents through associate headcount reductions. We recorded net rationalization charges of $240 million in 2010 ($225 million after tax or $0.93 per share). Rationalization actions in 2010 consisted of the plan to close our tire manufacturing facility in Union City, Tennessee, the consolidation of several warehouses in North American Tire, an increase in costs related to the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France, and the closure of a tire manufacturing facility in Taiwan. Additional rationalization charges of approximately $50 million related to 2010 rationalization plans have not yet been recorded and are expected to be incurred and recorded during the next twelve months. We recorded net rationalization charges of $227 million in 2009 ($182 million after tax or $0.75 per share). Rationalization actions in 2009 consisted of initiatives in North American Tire to reduce manufacturing headcount at several facilities, including Union City, Tennessee; Danville, Virginia and Topeka, Kansas, to respond to lower production demand. Additional salaried headcount reductions were initiated at our corporate offices in Akron, Ohio, in North American Tire and throughout EMEA. We also initiated the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and manufacturing headcount reductions at each of our two facilities in Brazil. Upon completion of the 2010 plans, we estimate that annual operating costs will be reduced by approximately $97 million ($86 million CGS and $11 million SAG). The savings realized in 2010 for the 2010 plans totaled $9 million ($4 million CGS and $5 million SAG). In addition, savings realized in 2010 for the 2009 plans totaled $147 million ($121 million CGS and $26 million SAG). For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. Interest Expense Interest expense was $316 million in 2010, increasing $5 million compared to 2009. The increase was due primarily to higher weighted average interest rates in 2010 partially offset by lower average debt levels. Other Expense Other Expense in 2010 was $186 million, increasing $146 million from $40 million in 2009. Net foreign currency exchange losses in 2010 were $159 million compared to $7 million in 2009. The 2010 period included a first quarter foreign exchange loss of $110 million ($99 million after tax or $0.41 per share) resulting from the January 8, 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar and a fourth quarter foreign exchange loss of $24 million ($20 million after tax or $0.08 per share) in connection with the January 1, 2011 elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure, which was announced by the Venezuelan government in December 2010. Foreign currency exchange also reflected net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy was considered to be highly inflationary under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of 100% over the latest three year period, based upon the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary. All gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since January 1, 2010 were determined using official exchange rates. On January 8, 2010, Venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods. For essential goods the official exchange rate was 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. As announced by the Venezuelan government in December 2010, on January 1, 2011, the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated and the exchange rate for essential goods cannot be used for our unsettled amounts at December 31, 2010. Effective January 1, 2011, the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar was established for substantially all goods. The $110 million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of 2010 primarily consisted of a $157 million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, at the time of the January 2010 devaluation. The loss was primarily related to cash deposits in Venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods, and was 32 Table of Contents partially offset by a $47 million subsidy receivable related to U.S. dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods. Since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate, we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates. Throughout 2010, we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable, and a substantial portion of purchases by our Venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods. As a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods, we no longer expect our Venezuelan subsidiary to settle payables at that exchange rate. Accordingly, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at December 31, 2010. Financing fees in 2010 of $95 million included $56 million ($56 million after tax or $0.23 per share) related to the redemption of $973 million of long term debt, of which $50 million were cash premiums paid on the redemption and $6 million were financing fees which were written off. Also included in financing fees were costs related to our debt exchange offer of $5 million ($5 million after tax or $0.02 per share). Net gains on asset sales were $73 million ($48 million after tax or $0.20 per share) in 2010 compared to net losses on asset sales of $30 million ($30 million after tax or $0.13 per share) in 2009. Net gains in 2010 related primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand and the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of a warehouse in Guatemala in 2008. Net losses in 2009 were due primarily to the sale of certain of our properties in Akron, Ohio that comprise our current headquarters in connection with the development of a proposed new headquarters in Akron, Ohio. The 2010 period also included a charge of $25 million ($18 million after tax or $0.07 per share) related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior years. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other Expense. Income Taxes Tax expense in 2010 was $172 million on income before income taxes of $8 million primarily driven by a U.S. loss of $529 million with no tax benefit. For 2009 tax expense was $7 million on a loss before income taxes of $357 million. Our income tax expense or benefit is allocated among operations and items charged or credited directly to shareholders equity. Pursuant to this allocation requirement, for the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, a $9 million ($9 million after minority or $0.04 per share) and $100 million ($100 million after minority or $0.42 per share), respectively, non cash tax benefit has been allocated to the loss from our U.S. operations, with offsetting tax expense allocated to items, primarily attributable to employee benefits, charged directly to shareholders equity. Income tax expense in 2010 also included net tax benefits of $33 million ($31 million after minority or $0.13 per share) primarily related to a $16 million benefit on enacted tax law changes and $20 million of tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. Income tax expense in 2009 also included net tax benefits of $42 million ($42 million after minority or $0.18 per share) primarily related to a $29 million benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on our Australian operations and a $19 million benefit resulting from the settlement of our 1997 through 2003 Competent Authority claim between the United States and Canada. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above. Our losses in various taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. However, in certain foreign locations, it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all, or a portion, of these valuation allowances within the next 12 months will exist, resulting in possible one time tax benefits of up to $150 million ($135 million net of minority interest). For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. 33 Table of Contents Minority Shareholders Net Income Minority shareholders net income was $52 million in 2010, compared to $11 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to increased earnings in our joint venture in Europe. 2009 Compared to 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, Goodyear net loss was $375 million, or $1.55 per share, compared to $77 million, or $0.32 per share, in 2008. Net Sales Net sales in 2009 of $16.3 billion decreased $3.2 billion, or 16%, compared to 2008 due primarily to lower tire volume of $1.4 billion, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, reduced sales in other tire related businesses of $924 million, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products, and foreign currency translation of $699 million, primarily in EMEA. Net sales also decreased $124 million due to unfavorable changes in product mix net of pricing improvements, reflecting a lower mix of high value added commercial truck and off the road tires due to weakness in those markets. The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31, (In millions of tires) 2009 2008 % Change Replacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 50.0 51.4 (2.9 )% International 78.0 82.7 (5.7 )% Total 128.0 134.1 (4.6 )% OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada) 12.7 19.7 (35.5 )% International 26.3 30.7 (14.1 )% Total 39.0 50.4 (22.5 )% Goodyear worldwide tire units 167.0 184.5 (9.5 )% The decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 17.5 million units, or 9.5%, compared to 2008, included a decrease of 11.4 million OE units, or 22.5%, due primarily to decreases in the consumer markets in North American Tire and EMEA due to recessionary economic conditions resulting in lower demand for new vehicles, and a decrease of 6.1 million units, or 4.6%, in replacement units, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA. North American Tire consumer replacement volume decreased 1.1 million units, or 2.3%, and EMEA consumer replacement volume decreased 2.7 million units, or 5.1%. The decline in consumer replacement volume is due in part to recessionary economic conditions in the U.S. and Europe. Cost of Goods Sold CGS was $13.7 billion in 2009, decreasing $2.5 billion, or 15%, compared to 2008. CGS in 2009 decreased due primarily to lower tire volume of $1.2 billion, mainly in North American Tire and EMEA, lower costs in other tire related businesses of $788 million, primarily in North American Tires cost of chemical products, foreign currency translation of $616 million, primarily in EMEA, product mix related manufacturing cost decreases of $331 million and lower raw material costs of $115 million. CGS also benefited from savings from rationalization plans of $105 million. CGS was unfavorably impacted by increased conversion costs of $655 million, due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $490 million due to lower production volume. CGS in 2009 included charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $43 million ($38 million after tax or $0.16 per share), compared to $28 million in 2008 ($28 million after tax or $0.12 per share). CGS in 2009 also included a charge of 34 Table of Contents $5 million ($5 million after tax or $0.02 per share) related to our new labor contract with the USW. CGS was 83.9% of sales in 2009 compared to 82.8% in 2008. Selling, Administrative and General Expense SAG was $2.4 billion in 2009, decreasing $196 million, or 8%, compared to 2008. SAG decreased due primarily to reduced foreign currency translation of $105 million, lower advertising expenses of $52 million, savings from rationalization plans of $42 million, reduced transportation and warehousing costs of $27 million, lower costs for consultants and contract labor of $22 million and other cost reduction actions. SAG reflected increased incentive compensation costs of $97 million of which approximately 50% was due to an increase in our stock price. SAG in 2009 was 14.7% of sales, compared to 13.3% in 2008. Rationalizations We recorded net rationalization charges of $227 million in 2009 ($182 million after tax or $0.75 per share). Rationalization actions in 2009 consisted of initiatives in North American Tire to reduce manufacturing headcount at several facilities, including Union City, Tennessee; Danville, Virginia and Topeka, Kansas, to respond to lower production demand. Additional salaried headcount reductions were initiated at our corporate offices in Akron, Ohio, in North American Tire and throughout EMEA. We also initiated the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and manufacturing headcount reductions at each of our two facilities in Brazil. We recorded net rationalization charges of $184 million in 2008 ($167 million after tax or $0.69 per share), which consisted primarily of the closure of the Somerton, Australia tire manufacturing facility, the closure of the Tyler, Texas mix center, and our plan to exit 92 of our underperforming retail stores in the U.S. Other rationalization actions in 2008 related to plans to reduce manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses through headcount reductions in all of our strategic business units. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs. Interest Expense Interest expense was $311 million in 2009, decreasing $9 million compared to 2008. The decrease was due primarily to lower weighted average interest rates in 2009, partially offset by higher average debt levels. Other Expense Other Expense was $40 million in 2009 compared to $59 million in 2008. Other Expense in 2009 decreased due primarily to lower expenses for financing fees and financial instruments, general and product liability discontinued products, and foreign currency exchange. Other Expense in 2009 was adversely affected by net losses on asset sales and lower interest income. Other Expense in 2009 included a gain of $26 million ($13 million after tax or $0.05 per share) from the recognition of insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand, net losses on asset sales of $30 million ($30 million after tax or $0.13 per share) due primarily to the sale of properties in Akron, Ohio, a loss on the liquidation of our subsidiary in Guatemala of $18 million ($18 million after tax or $0.08 per share), and a charge for a legal reserve for a closed facility of $5 million ($4 million after tax or $0.02 per share). For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other Expense. Income Taxes Tax expense in 2009 was $7 million on a loss before income taxes of $357 million. For 2008, we recorded tax expense of $209 million on income before income taxes of $186 million. Our income tax expense or benefit is allocated among operations and items charged or credited directly to shareholders equity. Pursuant to this allocation requirement, for 2009, a $100 million non cash tax benefit ($100 million after minority or $0.42 per share) has been allocated to the loss from our U.S. operations, with offsetting tax expense allocated to items, 35 Table of Contents primarily attributable to employee benefits, charged directly to shareholders equity. Income tax expense in 2009 also included net tax benefits of $42 million ($42 million after minority or $0.18 per share) primarily related to a $29 million benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on our Australian operations and a $19 million benefit resulting from the settlement of our 1997 through 2003 Competent Authority claim between the United States and Canada. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above. For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. Minority Shareholders Net Income Minority shareholders net income was $11 million in 2009, compared to $54 million in 2008. The decrease was due primarily to decreased earnings in our joint venture in Europe. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information reflects our strategic business units (SBUs), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis. Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write off and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items. Total segment operating income was $917 million in 2010, $372 million in 2009 and $804 million in 2008. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2010 was 4.9%, compared to 2.3% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2008. Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income (Loss) before Income Taxes. North American Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Tire Units 66.7 62.7 71.1 Net Sales $ 8,205 $ 6,977 $ 8,255 Operating Income (Loss) 18 (305 ) (156 ) Operating Margin 0.2 % (4.4 )% (1.9 )% 2010 Compared to 2009 North American Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 4.0 million units, or 6.3%, from the 2009 period. The increase was primarily related to an increase in OE volume of 3.2 million units, or 25.4%, primarily in our consumer business, due to increased vehicle production. Replacement volume increased 0.8 million units, or 1.4%, due primarily to improved industry volumes driven by economic growth. Net sales in 2010 increased $1.2 billion, or 17.6%, compared to 2009 due primarily to increased sales in other tire related businesses of $610 million, primarily related to an increase in the price and volume of third party sales of 36 Table of Contents chemical products. Higher tire volume of $304 million, improved price and product mix of $269 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $39 million also contributed to the growth in net sales. Operating income in 2010 was $18 million, improving $323 million from a loss of $305 million in 2009. Price and product mix improved $260 million, which more than offset raw material price increases of $177 million. Operating income also benefited from lower conversion costs of $171 million, increased operating income in our other tire related business of $47 million, primarily related to sales of chemical products, higher tire volume of $26 million and lower transportation costs of $20 million. The decrease in conversion costs was primarily driven by lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $119 million due to higher production volume and savings from rationalization plans of $55 million. Lower employee benefit costs and productivity improvements were offset by inflation and higher profit sharing costs. SAG expense increased $15 million driven by increased advertising costs of $15 million and higher general and product liability expenses of $14 million partially offset by savings from rationalization plans of $8 million and lower bad debt expense of $6 million. Operating income in 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million primarily related to the closure of our Union City, Tennessee manufacturing facility, net gains on asset sales of $2 million and charges for accelerated depreciation of $2 million. Operating loss in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $112 million, charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $16 million, and net gains on asset sales of $4 million. 2009 Compared to 2008 North American Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 8.4 million units, or 11.9%, from the 2008 period. The decrease was primarily related to a decline in OE volume of 7 million units, or 35.5%, primarily in our consumer business, due to reduced vehicle production. Replacement volume decreased 1.4 million units, or 2.9%, primarily in the consumer business, due to continuing recessionary economic conditions. Net sales in 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 15.5%, compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased sales in other tire related businesses of $729 million, primarily related to third party sales of chemical products, lower tire volume of $635 million and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million. Net sales were favorably affected by improved price and product mix of $124 million. Operating loss in 2009 increased $149 million, or 95.5%, compared to 2008 due primarily to higher conversion costs of $220 million, decreased sales volume of $77 million and lower operating income in chemical and other tire related businesses of $82 million. Conversion costs increased due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $245 million as a result of reduced production volume, and increased pension expense as a result of lower 2008 returns on plan assets and higher amortization of net losses. Increased pension and defined contribution expense of $159 million more than offset savings resulting from the implementation of the Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) of $89 million. Conversion costs were favorably impacted by savings from rationalization plans of $60 million and lower utility costs of $21 million. Operating income was favorably affected by lower raw material costs of $85 million, improved price and product mix of $78 million, reduced SAG of $38 million and lower transportation costs of $19 million. SAG decreased due primarily to reduced warehousing costs and savings from rationalization programs. Operating loss in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $112 million, $16 million of charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs, and net gains on asset sales of $4 million. Operating income in 2008 excluded net rationalization charges of $54 million, net gains on asset sales of $18 million and $3 million of charges for accelerated depreciation.

OE volume increased 3.2 million units, or 24.4%, primarily in our consumer business, due to increased vehicle production. Replacement volume increased 2.8 million units, or 5.2%, primarily in the consumer business, due to improved economic conditions and a strong winter season. Net sales in 2010 increased $606 million, or 10.4%, compared to 2009, due primarily to higher volume of $454 million and improved price and product mix of $356 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $193 million. Operating income in 2010 increased $153 million, or 92.2%, compared to 2009, due primarily to lower conversion costs of $174 million and increased volume of $118 million. Conversion costs decreased due primarily to lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $108 million due to higher production volume. Operating income was unfavorably affected by higher raw material costs of $182 million, which were partially offset by improved price and product mix of $131 million, higher SAG expenses of $73 million, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $17 million. SAG expenses increased due to higher wages and benefits of $35 million and increased advertising expenses of $26 million. Conversion costs and SAG expenses included savings from rationalization plans of $12 million and $7 million, respectively. Operating income in 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $41 million and net gains on asset sales of $6 million and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $1 million. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $82 million and net gains on asset sales of $1 million. EMEAs results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 35% and 33% of EMEAs net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Germany will have a significant impact on EMEAs future performance. In addition, excluding the estimated loss on the sale of approximately $50 million to $75 million, EMEAs operating income is expected to be favorably affected by approximately $20 million to $25 million on an annualized basis due to the anticipated sale of our EMEA farm tire business as a result of recent operating losses in that business. The transaction is subject to the exercise of a put option by us following completion of a social plan related to the previously announced discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and required consultation with various works councils. 2009 Compared to 2008 Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 7.6 million units, or 10.3%, from the 2008 period. OE volume decreased 4.5 million units, or 25.4%, primarily in our consumer business, due to reduced vehicle production. Replacement volume decreased 3.1 million units, or 5.5%, primarily in the consumer business, due to recessionary economic conditions. Net sales in 2009 decreased $1.5 billion, or 20.7%, compared to 2008, due primarily to lower volume of $665 million, foreign currency translation of $450 million and lower sales in other tire related businesses of $150 million. Net sales also decreased by $250 million as a result of unfavorable changes in product mix, net of pricing improvements. Operating income in 2009 decreased $259 million, or 60.9%, compared to 2008, due primarily to higher conversion costs of $258 million, decreased volume of $148 million, and decreased operating income in other tire related businesses of $44 million. Conversion costs increased due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $195 million due to reduced production volume. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $19 million. Operating income was favorably affected by lower SAG expenses of $113 million, improved price and mix of $22 million, lower raw material costs of $16 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $16 million. SAG savings included lower advertising expenses of $45 million, savings from rationalization plans of $20 million, lower consulting and contract labor costs of $16 million and reduced travel related expenses of $16 million. 38 Table of Contents Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $82 million and net gains on asset sales of $1 million.

Replacement tire volume increased 0.9 million units, or 6.7%, reflecting increased volume in both consumer and commercial businesses. OE volume increased 0.7 million units, or 12.3%, due primarily to an increase in our consumer business. Net sales in 2010 increased $344 million, or 19.0%, from the 2009 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $219 million and increased volume of $128 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $30 million which included $192 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte. Operating income in 2010 increased $29 million, or 9.6%, from the same period in 2009, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $188 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $84 million, and lower conversion costs of $24 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, higher SAG costs of $26 million, and lower profitability on intersegment transfers of $24 million. Higher SAG expenses included higher wages and benefits of $13 million and higher warehousing expenses of $11 million. Conversion costs included lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $41 million and savings from rationalization plans of $8 million. Operating income in 2010 excluded a charge of $25 million related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior periods, net gains on asset sales of $7 million, and net rationalization charges of $5 million. In addition, a $134 million foreign currency exchange loss in Venezuela also is excluded from operating income in 2010. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $20 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million. In addition, operating income excluded charges of $18 million in 2009 resulting from the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses in connection with the liquidation of our subsidiary in Guatemala. Latin American Tires results are highly dependent upon Brazil, which accounted for approximately 61% and 51% of Latin American Tires net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Brazil will have a significant impact on Latin American Tires future performance. In addition, Latin America Tires operating income is expected to be adversely impacted by approximately $30 million to $35 million on an annualized basis due to the anticipated sale of our Latin American Tire farm tire business. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2011. Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2010 and 2009. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating results by approximately $85 million as compared to 2009. The elimination of the official exchange rate for essential goods is not expected to have a significant impact on Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2011 compared to 2010.

Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 43% and 45% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. In 2011, start up expenses of our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China are expected to adversely impact Asia Pacific Tires operating income by $30 million to $40 million compared to 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 0.6 million units, or 2.9%, from the 2008 period. Replacement unit sales decreased 0.8 million units, or 6.3%, while OE volumes increased 0.2 million units, or 3.4%, primarily in the consumer business. The net decrease in units is due to recessionary economic conditions, primarily in Australia, that were partially offset by increased growth in vehicle production in China. Net sales in 2009 decreased $120 million, or 6.6%, compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $88 million, lower volume of $48 million and decreased sales in other tire related businesses of $12 million, primarily in the retail business. Net sales were favorably affected by improved price and product mix of $28 million. Operating income in 2009 increased $42 million, or 25.0%, compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to improved price and mix of $38 million, lower raw material costs of $30 million and decreased conversion costs of $6 million.

In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and $10 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to: general and product liability and other litigation, workers compensation, recoverability of goodwill, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions, and pensions and other postretirement benefits. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As 41 Table of Contents additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos 1) in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past, or 2) in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts. A significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $126 million at December 31, 2010. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was $63 million. At December 31, 2010, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities, net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries, could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately $10 million. We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements in principle with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors. As of December 31, 2010, (i) we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $67 million, and (ii) we expect that approximately 50% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. The receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Of this amount, $8 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts receivable at December 31, 2010. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $291 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers compensation claims at December 31, 2010. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return. For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Recoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized. Rather, goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $683 million at December 31, 2010. We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units: North American Tire, Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, Latin American Tire, and Asia Pacific Tire. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units. There have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in 2010. Our annual impairment testing is conducted as of July 31st each year and for 2010 our analysis indicated no impairment of goodwill. For purposes of our annual testing in 2010, we determined the estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow approach. We believe this methodology is appropriate in the determination of fair value. We 42 Table of Contents may also use different fair value techniques when we believe a discounted cash flow approach may not provide an appropriate determination of fair value. The discounted cash flow model of the reporting units is based on the forecasted operating cash flow for the current year, projected operating cash flows for the next nine years (determined using forecasted amounts as well as an estimated growth rate) and a terminal value beyond ten years. Discounted cash flows consist of the operating cash flows for each business unit less an estimate for capital expenditures. The key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow approach include growth rates, projected segment operating income, changes in working capital, our plan for capital expenditures, anticipated funding for pensions, and a discount rate equal to our assumed long term cost of capital. Corporate administrative expenses are allocations of corporate overhead that we make to each strategic business unit and are excluded from the discounted cash flow model. Cash flows may be adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items. As segment operating income was the starting point for determining operating cash flow, which excludes non recurring or unusual items, there were no other non recurring or unusual items excluded from the calculations of operating cash flow in any of the periods included in our determination of fair value. We consider significant decreases in forecasted cash flows in future periods to be an indication of a potential impairment. At the time of our annual impairment testing, fair value would have to decline in excess of 40% for North American Tire, over 45% for EMEA and over 20% for Asia Pacific Tire to reduce fair value below carrying value. The discount rate used would have to increase over two percentage points for North American Tire, over seven percentage points for EMEA and over two percentage points for Asia Pacific Tire or the assumed growth rate would have to be negative for each of the business units to indicate a potential impairment. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2010, we had a valuation allowance aggregating $3.1 billion against all of our net Federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets. We assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in the U.S. and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal, state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including: life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, 43 Table of Contents long term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation levels, future health care costs, and maximum company covered benefit costs. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated Aa or higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over a period of 15 years or more, estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected. The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 5.20% and 4.62%, respectively, at December 31, 2010, compared to 5.75% and 5.45% for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2010 was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $296 million in 2010, compared to $314 million in 2009 and $312 million in 2008. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $33 million in 2010, compared to $32 million in 2009 and $84 million in 2008. Interest cost decreased in 2009 as a result of the reduction in other postretirement benefits liability due to the VEBA settlement. The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation, shareholders equity, and 2011 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: + / Change at December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) Change PBO/ABO Equity 2011 Expense Pensions: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5 % $ 298 $ 298 $ 11 Actual 2010 return on assets +/ 1.0 % N/A 33 5 Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 % N/A N/A 36 Other Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5 % $ 12 $ 12 $ Health care cost trends total cost +/ 1.0 % 3 3 A significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $2,314 million in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2010 is a result of 2008 plan asset losses and the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining our 2010 U.S. net periodic pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $133 million of the net actuarial loss in 2010. We will recognize approximately $135 million of net actuarial losses in 2011. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2010, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2011 before it begins to gradually decline. 44 Table of Contents The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 14.4%, 25.6% and (31.7)% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 8.5% for all three years. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans. We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2010 and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $180 million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2010 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. The net actuarial loss increased from 2009 due to the decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2010. For purposes of determining 2010 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $9 million of the net actuarial losses in 2010. We will recognize approximately $12 million of net actuarial losses in 2011. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2010, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2011 before it begins to gradually decline. The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. plans is approximately 14 years.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We faced an uncertain business environment in 2010 as the global economy continued its recovery from the recessionary economic conditions that existed in many parts of the world during 2008 and 2009, particularly in North America and Europe. We also faced a number of substantial challenges, such as rapidly rising raw material and energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations, and the devaluation of the currency and economic weakness in Venezuela. Global tire industry demand, while improving, continues to be below pre recessionary levels in North America and remains hard to predict, especially for OE production. Given the uncertain economic environment, in 2010 we remained focused on cash flow in order to provide funding for investments in future growth, and took several actions to strengthen our liquidity, including: Further improvements in working capital through strong inventory management, improved vendor terms and good collections at year end; and The successful completion of a $1.0 billion debt offering in August 2010 that addressed our 2011 debt maturities. For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2010, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview. At December 31, 2010, we had $2,005 million in Cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1,922 million at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the reduced net loss compared to 2009, improvements in trade working capital of $52 million and proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 8.25% senior notes due 2020. Partially offsetting these increases in Cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $944 million and the redemption of $973 million of outstanding notes, including $713 million of notes due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $2,475 million and $2,567 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility due 2013 $ 1,001 $ 892 505 million revolving credit facility due 2012 664 712 China financing agreements 394 530 Other U.S. and international debt 158 124 Notes payable and overdrafts 258 309 $ 2,475 $ 2,567 At December 31, 2010, our unused availability included $394 million which can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. These credit facilities, along with government grants, should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of these manufacturing facilities. There were $153 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2010. We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs. In 2011, we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $250 million to $300 million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $350 million and $375 million. The strategic initiatives described above are intended to permit us to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. In March 2010, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 7.857% notes due 2011 for a new series of 8.75% notes due 2020. A total of $262 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.857% notes due 2011 were validly tendered, and $282 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.75% notes due 2020 were issued in the exchange. In August 2010, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 2020. We used the net proceeds from the offerings of those notes, together with available cash, to redeem $973 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes on September 29, 2010, including $713 million of notes due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. As a result of these transactions, we have paid off all of our material debt maturities due in 2011. On June 25, 2010, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (the Pension Relief Act) was signed into law. The Pension Relief Act provides funding relief for defined benefit pension plan sponsors by deferring near term contributions. As allowed by the Pension Relief Act, we elected funding relief for the 2009 plan year and expect to elect funding relief for the 2011 plan year, which is expected to reduce our total U.S. pension contributions in 2011 to 2014 by approximately $275 million to $325 million. We currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans 46 Table of Contents of approximately $200 million to $225 million in 2011. The reduction from funding relief will result in increased contributions in years after 2014. SRI has certain minority exit rights that, if triggered and exercised, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. As of the date of this filing, SRI has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable. Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as Venezuela, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Venezuelan subsidiary, that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2010, approximately $627 million of net assets were subject to such restrictions. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy was considered to be highly inflationary under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of 100% over the latest three year period, based upon the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary. All gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since January 1, 2010 were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in Other Expense. On January 8, 2010, Venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods. For essential goods the official exchange rate was 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. As announced by the Venezuelan government in December 2010, on January 1, 2011, the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated and the official exchange rate for essential goods cannot be used for our unsettled amounts at December 31, 2010. Effective January 1, 2011, the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar was established for substantially all goods. The $110 million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of 2010 primarily consisted of a $157 million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, at the time of the January 2010 devaluation. The loss was primarily related to cash deposits in Venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods, and was partially offset by a $47 million subsidy receivable related to U.S. dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods. Since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate, we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates. Throughout 2010, we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable, and a substantial portion of purchases by our Venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods. As a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods, we no longer expect our Venezuelan subsidiary to settle payables at that exchange rate. Accordingly, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at December 31, 2010. If in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations. At 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $210 million which consisted primarily of $188 million of cash, $18 million of deferred tax assets and $4 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $44 million which consisted primarily of $17 million of intercompany payables, $12 million of accounts payable trade and $7 million of compensation and benefits. At December 31, 2009, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $389 million which consisted primarily of $370 million of cash, $11 million of deferred tax assets and $5 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $78 million which consisted primarily of $29 million of income taxes payable, $19 million of accounts payable trade, and $11 million of compensation and benefits. All monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2010, and were translated at 2.15 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009. Goodyear Venezuelas sales were 1.2% and 2.4% of our net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Goodyear Venezuelas operating income was 6.4% and 38.4% of our segment operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The percentage for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was high due to the operating loss in 2009 in North American Tire. Goodyear Venezuelas sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately 50% bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately 50% U.S. dollar denominated. A further 10% decrease in the bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar would decrease Goodyear Venezuelas sales and increase cost of goods sold by approximately $40 million and approximately $30 million, respectively, on an annual basis. During 2010, Goodyear Venezuela settled $116 million and $20 million, respectively, of U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2010, approximately 98% of those payables were settled at the essential goods rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2010, settlements of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were $107 million. At December 31, 2010, $19 million of the requested settlements were pending up to 180 days, $20 million were pending from 180 to 360 days and $68 million were pending over one year. Amounts pending from 180 to 360 days include dividends payable of $17 million and amounts pending over one year include imported tires of $27 million, intercompany charges for royalties of $15 million and dividends payable of $14 million. Currency exchange controls in Venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from Venezuela. Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2010 and 2009. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions and operational disruptions in Venezuela adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating income by approximately $85 million as compared to 2009. Additionally, we recorded $134 million in charges related to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte in 2010 in Other Expense. The operational challenges we face include high absenteeism, a lack of supplies and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods. In response to the devaluation and conditions in Venezuela, we continue to evaluate the need to adjust prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges, including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires. Our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material cost, production cost, market demand and adherence to government price controls. As a result, the elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure is not expected to have a significant impact on Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2011 compared to 2010. For a discussion of the risks related to our international operations, including Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2011 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. However, the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of these challenges. 48 Table of Contents Cash Position At December 31, 2010, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts: $415 million or 21% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Luxembourg, South Africa and Poland ($352 million or 18% at December 31, 2009), $393 million or 20% in Asia, primarily China, Australia and India ($217 million or 11% at December 31, 2009), and $368 million or 18% in Latin America, primarily Venezuela and Brazil ($533 million or 28% at December 31, 2009). Operating Activities Net cash provided by operations was $924 million in 2010, compared to $1,297 million in 2009 and net cash used of $739 million in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2010 were favorably impacted by the reduced net loss compared to 2009. Net cash provided by trade working capital was $52 million and $1,081 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and net cash used was $127 million in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included $1,007 million of VEBA contributions. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $859 million in 2010, compared to $663 million in 2009 and $1,058 million in 2008. Capital expenditures were $944 million in 2010, compared to $746 million in 2009 and $1,049 million in 2008. Capital expenditures in 2010 increased from 2009 due primarily to the expansion of manufacturing capacity in China and Chile. Capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 primarily related to projects targeted at increasing our capacity for high value added tires, which were scaled back in 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions. Investing cash flows included cash inflows of $26 million and $47 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a net cash outflow of $76 million in 2008 related to The Reserve Primary Fund. Investing cash flows also reflect cash provided from the disposition of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs and the divestiture of non core assets. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $179 million in 2010, compared to cash used of $654 million in 2009 and cash provided of $264 million in 2008. Financing activities in 2010 included net proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 8.25% senior notes due 2020 offset by the redemption of $973 million of our 7.857% notes due 2011, 8.625% senior notes due 2011 and 9% senior notes due 2015. Also included in 2010 were borrowings of $150 million to support the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. Financing cash flows in 2009 included the net proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016, the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility, and the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009. Consolidated debt at December 31, 2010 was $4,745 million, compared to $4,520 million at December 31, 2009. Financing cash flows in 2008 included outflows of $84 million for the acquisition of approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of our tire manufacturing subsidiary in Poland and the acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership in our tire manufacturing and distribution subsidiary in China. Credit Sources In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $7,689 million available at December 31, 2010, of which $2,475 million were unused, compared to $7,579 million available at December 31, 2009, of which $2,567 million were unused. At December 31, 2010, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $7,193 million, of which $2,217 million were unused, compared to $7,046 million and $2,258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $496 million, 49 Table of Contents of which $258 million were unused, compared to $533 million and $309 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time. Outstanding Notes At December 31, 2010, we had $2,371 million of outstanding notes, compared to $2,345 million at December 31, 2009. On March 5, 2010, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 7.857% notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) for a new series of 8.75% notes due 2020 (2020 Notes). A total of $262 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes were validly tendered, and $282 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes were issued in the exchange. On August 13, 2010, we issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 2020. These notes were sold at 99.163% of the principal amount at an effective yield of 8.375% and will mature on August 15, 2020. On August 25, 2010, we issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional notes, which were sold at 100.750% of the principal amount at an effective yield of 8.119%. These notes are unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities described below. On September 29, 2010, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2011 Notes, 8.625% senior notes due 2011, and 9% senior notes due 2015. The aggregate redemption price for these redemptions was $1,023 million, including a prepayment premium of $50 million. Certain of our notes were issued pursuant to indentures that contain varying covenants and other terms. In general, the terms of our indentures, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, under certain of our indentures, if the notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moodys and Standard Poors (SP) and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 505 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European and German Revolving Credit Facilities due 2012 Our amended and restated 505 million revolving credit facilities consist of a 155 million German revolving credit facility, which is only available to one of the German subsidiaries (the German borrower) of GDTE, and a 350 million European revolving credit facility, which is available to the same German borrower and to GDTE and certain of its other subsidiaries and contains a 50 million letter of credit sublimit. Goodyear and its subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. facilities provide unsecured guarantees to support the German and European revolving credit facilities and GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany also provide guarantees. GDTEs obligations under the facilities and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in a variety of collateral. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the German or the European revolving credit facilities. Letters of credit issued under the European revolving credit facility totaled $12 million (9 million) as of December 31, 2010 and $14 million (10 million) as of December 31, 2009. $1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013 Our $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be 50 Table of Contents increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under this facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company (the Parent Company) and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors that are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $1.5 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2010, our borrowing base, and therefore our availability, under this facility was $25 million below the facilitys stated amount of $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $474 million and $494 million, respectively, of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. $1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014 Our amended and restated second lien term loan facility may be increased by up to $300 million at our request, subject to the consent of the lenders making additional term loans. Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien credit facility. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, this facility was fully drawn. Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European and German revolving credit facilities have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our financial condition since December 31, 2006. Each of the facilities described above have customary defaults, including cross defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and our subsidiaries. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to Covenant Compliance below and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet) GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a pan European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides up to 450 million of funding and expires in 2015. Utilization under this facility is based on current available receivable balances. The facility is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity commitments. The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. It is an event of default under the facility if the ratio of GDTEs consolidated net indebtedness to its consolidated EBITDA is greater than 3.0 to 1.0. This financial covenant is substantially similar to the covenant included in the European credit facilities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount available and fully utilized under this program totaled $319 million (238 million) and $437 million (304 million), respectively. The program did not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in long term debt and capital leases. In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have an accounts receivable securitization program totaling $72 million and $68 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The receivables sold under this program also serve as collateral for the related facility. We retain the risk of loss related to these receivables in the event of non payment. These amounts are included in Notes payable and overdrafts. 51 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet) Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2010 and 2009. For these programs, we have concluded that there is no risk of loss to us from non payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the gross amount of receivables sold was $126 million and $113 million, respectively. Other Foreign Credit Facilities Our Chinese subsidiary has two financing agreements in China. At December 31, 2010, these non revolving credit facilities had total unused availability of up to 2.6 billion renminbi ($394 million) and can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. The facilities contain covenants relating to our Chinese subsidiary and have customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to our Chinese subsidiarys ability to perform its obligations under the facilities. One of the facilities (with 1.7 billion renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2010) matures in 2016 and principal amortization begins in 2013. At December 31, 2010, there were $99 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. The other facility (with 900 million renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2010) matures in 2018 and principal amortization begins in 2015. At December 31, 2010, there were $54 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. There were no amounts outstanding under either of the facilities at December 31, 2009. Covenant Compliance Our amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, make certain restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. We have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows: We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company and Guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (Available Cash) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $150 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2010, our availability under this facility of $1,001 million, plus our Available Cash of $830 million, totaled $1.8 billion, which is in excess of $150 million. We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0. In addition, our 505 million senior secured European and German revolving credit facilities contain non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTEs ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, and through March 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other 52 Table of Contents consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. Our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing, and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test. There are no known future changes to, or new covenants in, any of our existing debt obligations other than as described above. Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures. The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness, Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness and Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities. Potential Future Financings In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt. Dividends Under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied. Asset Dispositions The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions. 53 Table of Contents COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2010: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2010 (In millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Beyond 2015 Debt Obligations(1) $ 4,727 $ 423 $ 97 $ 103 $ 1,207 $ 324 $ 2,573 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 18 3 4 10 1 Interest Payments(3) 2,068 313 286 274 254 241 700 Operating Leases(4) 1,322 309 249 193 144 108 319 Pension Benefits(5) 2,277 325 588 563 463 338 NA Other Postretirement Benefits(6) 471 59 55 51 49 47 210 Workers Compensation(7) 390 71 52 38 29 23 177 Binding Commitments(8) 3,326 2,719 379 150 21 16 41 Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9) 36 19 2 11 1 3 $ 14,635 $ 4,241 $ 1,712 $ 1,393 $ 2,168 $ 1,098 $ 4,023 (1) Debt obligations include Notes payable and overdrafts. (2) The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $22 million. (3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2010 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. (4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $45 million, $37 million, $27 million, $19 million, $11 million and $15 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $154 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,168 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $903 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2010. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table for 2011, 2012 and 2013 represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for U.S. defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law, including the expected election of funding relief for the 2011 plan year as allowed by the Pension Relief Act; and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans. For years after 2013, the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans, and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our U.S. plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including: Projected Target Liability interest rate of 6.20% for 2011, 5.38% for 2012, 5.32% for 2013, 5.50% for 2014 and 5.65% for 2015, and plan asset returns of 8.5% for 2011 and beyond. 54 Table of Contents Future contributions are also affected by other factors such as: future interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions. (6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. (7) The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $291 million. (8) Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2010. (9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2010. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters. Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the global alliance agreements between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements. SRIs exit rights, in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers production levels. We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, 55 Table of Contents undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $26 million at December 31, 2010 and expire at various times through 2023. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words estimate, expect, intend and project, as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10 K. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including: if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected; higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expense; we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline; deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets or third party financing when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity; the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations; work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business; our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner; if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected; our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results; we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health; any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations; our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly; 56 Table of Contents we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales; we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims; our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded; we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity; we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results; the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of those interests; if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Commodity Price Risk The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire. Interest Rate Risk We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing. At December 31, 2010, 41% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 3.72% compared to 44% at an average rate of 3.13% at December 31, 2009. 57 Table of Contents The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 Carrying amount liability $ 2,691 $ 2,442 Fair value liability 2,791 2,532 Pro forma fair value liability 2,893 2,601 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements, and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 Fair value asset (liability) $9 $22 Pro forma decrease in fair value (113) (106) Contract maturities 1/11 10/19 1/10 10/19 The pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models. Fair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows: (In millions) 2010 2009 Asset (liability): Accounts receivable $25 $27 Other Assets 1 1 Other current liabilities (17) (6) For further information on foreign currency contracts, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview in this Form 10 K. 39 Table of Contents 2009 Compared to 2008 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 0.9 million units, or 4.5%, from the 2008 period. Replacement tire volume decreased 0.8 million units, or 5.9%, reflecting reduced volume in both consumer and commercial businesses. OE volume decreased 0.1 million units, or 1.3%, due primarily to a decrease in our commercial business. Net sales in 2009 decreased $274 million, or 13.1%, from the 2008 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $123 million, decreased volume of $92 million, lower sales of other tire related businesses of $33 million, and $26 million as a result of unfavorable changes in product mix, net of pricing improvements. Operating income in 2009 decreased $66 million, or 18.0%, from the same period in 2008, due primarily to higher conversion costs of $43 million, lower volume of $28 million, lower profitability on intersegment transfers of $21 million, higher inventory reserves of $4 million and costs related to manufacturing start up activities of $3 million. Conversion costs increased due primarily to higher under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $43 million and other inflation of $10 million. Conversion costs also included savings from rationalization plans of $15 million. Operating income was favorably affected by improvements in price and product mix of $69 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $16 million. Operating income in 2008 included a gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of an excise tax case. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $20 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million. Operating income in 2008 excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and net rationalization charges of $4 million. In addition, operating income excluded charges of $18 million and $16 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting from the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses in connection with the liquidation of our subsidiaries in Guatemala and Jamaica. Asia Pacific Tire Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Tire Units 21.4 19.2 19.8 Net Sales $ 2,062 $ 1,709 $ 1,829 Operating Income 250 210 168 Operating Margin 12.1 % 12.3 % 9.2 % 2010 Compared to 2009 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 2.2 million units, or 11.6%, from the 2009 period. OE volumes increased 1.6 million units, or 22.5%, primarily in the consumer business and replacement unit sales increased 0.6 million units, or 5.2%. The increase in units is due to continued growth in vehicle production in China and India. Net sales in 2010 increased $353 million, or 20.7%, compared to the 2009 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $172 million, increased volume of $158 million and improved price and product mix of $23 million. Operating income in 2010 increased $40 million, or 19.0%, compared to the 2009 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $110 million, which was offset by higher raw material costs of $106 million, increased volume of $32 million, favorable foreign currency translation of $21 million and decreased conversion costs of $19 million. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $16 million and lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $10 million. Operating income was adversely affected by start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China of approximately $10 million and higher SAG costs of $22 million, including increased wages and benefits of $9 million. Operating income in 2009 included a gain of $7 million from insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2007. Operating income in 2010 and 2009 excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $12 million and $26 million, respectively, and net rationalization charges of $11 million and $10 million, 40 Table of Contents respectively. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $58 million and $5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand in 2010. Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 43% and 45% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. In 2011, start up expenses of our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China are expected to adversely impact Asia Pacific Tires operating income by $30 million to $40 million compared to 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2009 decreased 0.6 million units, or 2.9%, from the 2008 period. Replacement unit sales decreased 0.8 million units, or 6.3%, while OE volumes increased 0.2 million units, or 3.4%, primarily in the consumer business. The net decrease in units is due to recessionary economic conditions, primarily in Australia, that were partially offset by increased growth in vehicle production in China. Net sales in 2009 decreased $120 million, or 6.6%, compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $88 million, lower volume of $48 million and decreased sales in other tire related businesses of $12 million, primarily in the retail business. Net sales were favorably affected by improved price and product mix of $28 million. Operating income in 2009 increased $42 million, or 25.0%, compared to the 2008 period, due primarily to improved price and mix of $38 million, lower raw material costs of $30 million and decreased conversion costs of $6 million. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $12 million, partially offset by $7 million of under absorbed fixed overhead costs due to reduced production volume. Operating income in 2009 included a gain of $7 million from insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2007. Operating income was adversely affected by lower volume of $13 million, decreased operating income in other tire related businesses of $8 million, and increases in incentive compensation expense of $9 million and in the cost of imported finished tires of $6 million. Operating income in 2009 and 2008 excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $26 million and $24 million, respectively, and net rationalization charges of $10 million and $83 million, respectively, primarily related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Australia. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $5 million and $10 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to: general and product liability and other litigation, workers compensation, recoverability of goodwill, deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions, and pensions and other postretirement benefits. General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As 41 Table of Contents additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos 1) in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past, or 2) in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts. A significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $126 million at December 31, 2010. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was $63 million. At December 31, 2010, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities, net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries, could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately $10 million. We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements in principle with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors. As of December 31, 2010, (i) we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $67 million, and (ii) we expect that approximately 50% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. The receivables recorded consist of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Of this amount, $8 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts receivable at December 31, 2010. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $291 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers compensation claims at December 31, 2010. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience, and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return. For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Recoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized. Rather, goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $683 million at December 31, 2010. We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units: North American Tire, Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, Latin American Tire, and Asia Pacific Tire. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units. There have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in 2010. Our annual impairment testing is conducted as of July 31st each year and for 2010 our analysis indicated no impairment of goodwill. For purposes of our annual testing in 2010, we determined the estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow approach. We believe this methodology is appropriate in the determination of fair value. We 42 Table of Contents may also use different fair value techniques when we believe a discounted cash flow approach may not provide an appropriate determination of fair value. The discounted cash flow model of the reporting units is based on the forecasted operating cash flow for the current year, projected operating cash flows for the next nine years (determined using forecasted amounts as well as an estimated growth rate) and a terminal value beyond ten years. Discounted cash flows consist of the operating cash flows for each business unit less an estimate for capital expenditures. The key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow approach include growth rates, projected segment operating income, changes in working capital, our plan for capital expenditures, anticipated funding for pensions, and a discount rate equal to our assumed long term cost of capital. Corporate administrative expenses are allocations of corporate overhead that we make to each strategic business unit and are excluded from the discounted cash flow model. Cash flows may be adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items. As segment operating income was the starting point for determining operating cash flow, which excludes non recurring or unusual items, there were no other non recurring or unusual items excluded from the calculations of operating cash flow in any of the periods included in our determination of fair value. We consider significant decreases in forecasted cash flows in future periods to be an indication of a potential impairment. At the time of our annual impairment testing, fair value would have to decline in excess of 40% for North American Tire, over 45% for EMEA and over 20% for Asia Pacific Tire to reduce fair value below carrying value. The discount rate used would have to increase over two percentage points for North American Tire, over seven percentage points for EMEA and over two percentage points for Asia Pacific Tire or the assumed growth rate would have to be negative for each of the business units to indicate a potential impairment. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2010, we had a valuation allowance aggregating $3.1 billion against all of our net Federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets. We assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in the U.S. and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal, state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash, and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Income Taxes. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including: life expectancies, retirement rates, discount rates, 43 Table of Contents long term rates of return on plan assets, future compensation levels, future health care costs, and maximum company covered benefit costs. Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends, including an assumption about inflation. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated Aa or higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over a period of 15 years or more, estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected. The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 5.20% and 4.62%, respectively, at December 31, 2010, compared to 5.75% and 5.45% for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2010 was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $296 million in 2010, compared to $314 million in 2009 and $312 million in 2008. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $33 million in 2010, compared to $32 million in 2009 and $84 million in 2008. Interest cost decreased in 2009 as a result of the reduction in other postretirement benefits liability due to the VEBA settlement. The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation, shareholders equity, and 2011 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: + / Change at December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) Change PBO/ABO Equity 2011 Expense Pensions: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5 % $ 298 $ 298 $ 11 Actual 2010 return on assets +/ 1.0 % N/A 33 5 Expected return on assets +/ 1.0 % N/A N/A 36 Other Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate +/ 0.5 % $ 12 $ 12 $ Health care cost trends total cost +/ 1.0 % 3 3 A significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $2,314 million in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2010 is a result of 2008 plan asset losses and the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining our 2010 U.S. net periodic pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $133 million of the net actuarial loss in 2010. We will recognize approximately $135 million of net actuarial losses in 2011. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2010, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2011 before it begins to gradually decline. 44 Table of Contents The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 14.4%, 25.6% and (31.7)% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 8.5% for all three years. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans. We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2010 and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $180 million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2010 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. The net actuarial loss increased from 2009 due to the decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2010. For purposes of determining 2010 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $9 million of the net actuarial losses in 2010. We will recognize approximately $12 million of net actuarial losses in 2011. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2010, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2011 before it begins to gradually decline. The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. plans is approximately 14 years. For further information on pensions and other postretirement benefits, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 14, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OVERVIEW Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We faced an uncertain business environment in 2010 as the global economy continued its recovery from the recessionary economic conditions that existed in many parts of the world during 2008 and 2009, particularly in North America and Europe. We also faced a number of substantial challenges, such as rapidly rising raw material and energy costs, wage inflation in emerging markets, continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations, and the devaluation of the currency and economic weakness in Venezuela. Global tire industry demand, while improving, continues to be below pre recessionary levels in North America and remains hard to predict, especially for OE production. Given the uncertain economic environment, in 2010 we remained focused on cash flow in order to provide funding for investments in future growth, and took several actions to strengthen our liquidity, including: Further improvements in working capital through strong inventory management, improved vendor terms and good collections at year end; and The successful completion of a $1.0 billion debt offering in August 2010 that addressed our 2011 debt maturities. For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2010, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview. At December 31, 2010, we had $2,005 million in Cash and cash equivalents, compared to $1,922 million at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the reduced net loss compared to 2009, improvements in trade working capital of $52 million and proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 8.25% senior notes due 2020. Partially offsetting these increases in Cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $944 million and the redemption of $973 million of outstanding notes, including $713 million of notes due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $2,475 million and $2,567 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility due 2013 $ 1,001 $ 892 505 million revolving credit facility due 2012 664 712 China financing agreements 394 530 Other U.S. and international debt 158 124 Notes payable and overdrafts 258 309 $ 2,475 $ 2,567 At December 31, 2010, our unused availability included $394 million which can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. These credit facilities, along with government grants, should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of these manufacturing facilities. There were $153 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2010. We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs. In 2011, we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $250 million to $300 million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $350 million and $375 million. The strategic initiatives described above are intended to permit us to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. In March 2010, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 7.857% notes due 2011 for a new series of 8.75% notes due 2020. A total of $262 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.857% notes due 2011 were validly tendered, and $282 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.75% notes due 2020 were issued in the exchange. In August 2010, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 2020. We used the net proceeds from the offerings of those notes, together with available cash, to redeem $973 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes on September 29, 2010, including $713 million of notes due in 2011 and $260 million of notes due in 2015. As a result of these transactions, we have paid off all of our material debt maturities due in 2011. On June 25, 2010, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (the Pension Relief Act) was signed into law. The Pension Relief Act provides funding relief for defined benefit pension plan sponsors by deferring near term contributions. As allowed by the Pension Relief Act, we elected funding relief for the 2009 plan year and expect to elect funding relief for the 2011 plan year, which is expected to reduce our total U.S. pension contributions in 2011 to 2014 by approximately $275 million to $325 million. We currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans 46 Table of Contents of approximately $200 million to $225 million in 2011. The reduction from funding relief will result in increased contributions in years after 2014. SRI has certain minority exit rights that, if triggered and exercised, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. As of the date of this filing, SRI has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable. Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as Venezuela, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Venezuelan subsidiary, that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2010, approximately $627 million of net assets were subject to such restrictions. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy was considered to be highly inflationary under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of 100% over the latest three year period, based upon the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary. All gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since January 1, 2010 were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in Other Expense. On January 8, 2010, Venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods. For essential goods the official exchange rate was 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. As announced by the Venezuelan government in December 2010, on January 1, 2011, the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated and the official exchange rate for essential goods cannot be used for our unsettled amounts at December 31, 2010. Effective January 1, 2011, the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar was established for substantially all goods. The $110 million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of 2010 primarily consisted of a $157 million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, at the time of the January 2010 devaluation. The loss was primarily related to cash deposits in Venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods, and was partially offset by a $47 million subsidy receivable related to U.S. dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods. Since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate, we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates. Throughout 2010, we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable, and a substantial portion of purchases by our Venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods. As a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods, we no longer expect our Venezuelan subsidiary to settle payables at that exchange rate. Accordingly, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at December 31, 2010. If in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations. At 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $210 million which consisted primarily of $188 million of cash, $18 million of deferred tax assets and $4 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $44 million which consisted primarily of $17 million of intercompany payables, $12 million of accounts payable trade and $7 million of compensation and benefits. At December 31, 2009, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $389 million which consisted primarily of $370 million of cash, $11 million of deferred tax assets and $5 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $78 million which consisted primarily of $29 million of income taxes payable, $19 million of accounts payable trade, and $11 million of compensation and benefits. All monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2010, and were translated at 2.15 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009. Goodyear Venezuelas sales were 1.2% and 2.4% of our net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Goodyear Venezuelas operating income was 6.4% and 38.4% of our segment operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The percentage for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was high due to the operating loss in 2009 in North American Tire. Goodyear Venezuelas sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately 50% bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately 50% U.S. dollar denominated. A further 10% decrease in the bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar would decrease Goodyear Venezuelas sales and increase cost of goods sold by approximately $40 million and approximately $30 million, respectively, on an annual basis. During 2010, Goodyear Venezuela settled $116 million and $20 million, respectively, of U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2010, approximately 98% of those payables were settled at the essential goods rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2010, settlements of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were $107 million. At December 31, 2010, $19 million of the requested settlements were pending up to 180 days, $20 million were pending from 180 to 360 days and $68 million were pending over one year. Amounts pending from 180 to 360 days include dividends payable of $17 million and amounts pending over one year include imported tires of $27 million, intercompany charges for royalties of $15 million and dividends payable of $14 million. Currency exchange controls in Venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from Venezuela. Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2010 and 2009. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions and operational disruptions in Venezuela adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating income by approximately $85 million as compared to 2009. Additionally, we recorded $134 million in charges related to the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte in 2010 in Other Expense. The operational challenges we face include high absenteeism, a lack of supplies and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods. In response to the devaluation and conditions in Venezuela, we continue to evaluate the need to adjust prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges, including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires. Our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material cost, production cost, market demand and adherence to government price controls. As a result, the elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure is not expected to have a significant impact on Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2011 compared to 2010. For a discussion of the risks related to our international operations, including Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2011 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. However, the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of these challenges. 48 Table of Contents Cash Position At December 31, 2010, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts: $415 million or 21% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Luxembourg, South Africa and Poland ($352 million or 18% at December 31, 2009), $393 million or 20% in Asia, primarily China, Australia and India ($217 million or 11% at December 31, 2009), and $368 million or 18% in Latin America, primarily Venezuela and Brazil ($533 million or 28% at December 31, 2009). Operating Activities Net cash provided by operations was $924 million in 2010, compared to $1,297 million in 2009 and net cash used of $739 million in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2010 were favorably impacted by the reduced net loss compared to 2009. Net cash provided by trade working capital was $52 million and $1,081 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and net cash used was $127 million in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included $1,007 million of VEBA contributions. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $859 million in 2010, compared to $663 million in 2009 and $1,058 million in 2008. Capital expenditures were $944 million in 2010, compared to $746 million in 2009 and $1,049 million in 2008. Capital expenditures in 2010 increased from 2009 due primarily to the expansion of manufacturing capacity in China and Chile. Capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 primarily related to projects targeted at increasing our capacity for high value added tires, which were scaled back in 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions. Investing cash flows included cash inflows of $26 million and $47 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a net cash outflow of $76 million in 2008 related to The Reserve Primary Fund. Investing cash flows also reflect cash provided from the disposition of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs and the divestiture of non core assets. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $179 million in 2010, compared to cash used of $654 million in 2009 and cash provided of $264 million in 2008. Financing activities in 2010 included net proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 8.25% senior notes due 2020 offset by the redemption of $973 million of our 7.857% notes due 2011, 8.625% senior notes due 2011 and 9% senior notes due 2015. Also included in 2010 were borrowings of $150 million to support the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. Financing cash flows in 2009 included the net proceeds from the issuance of our $1.0 billion 10.5% senior notes due 2016, the $700 million net repayment of amounts incurred under our first lien revolving credit facility, and the repayment at maturity of our $500 million senior floating rate notes due 2009. Consolidated debt at December 31, 2010 was $4,745 million, compared to $4,520 million at December 31, 2009. Financing cash flows in 2008 included outflows of $84 million for the acquisition of approximately 6% of the outstanding shares of our tire manufacturing subsidiary in Poland and the acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership in our tire manufacturing and distribution subsidiary in China. Credit Sources In aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $7,689 million available at December 31, 2010, of which $2,475 million were unused, compared to $7,579 million available at December 31, 2009, of which $2,567 million were unused. At December 31, 2010, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $7,193 million, of which $2,217 million were unused, compared to $7,046 million and $2,258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $496 million, 49 Table of Contents of which $258 million were unused, compared to $533 million and $309 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time. Outstanding Notes At December 31, 2010, we had $2,371 million of outstanding notes, compared to $2,345 million at December 31, 2009. On March 5, 2010, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 7.857% notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) for a new series of 8.75% notes due 2020 (2020 Notes). A total of $262 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 Notes were validly tendered, and $282 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes were issued in the exchange. On August 13, 2010, we issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior notes due 2020. These notes were sold at 99.163% of the principal amount at an effective yield of 8.375% and will mature on August 15, 2020. On August 25, 2010, we issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional notes, which were sold at 100.750% of the principal amount at an effective yield of 8.119%. These notes are unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that also guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities described below. On September 29, 2010, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2011 Notes, 8.625% senior notes due 2011, and 9% senior notes due 2015. The aggregate redemption price for these redemptions was $1,023 million, including a prepayment premium of $50 million. Certain of our notes were issued pursuant to indentures that contain varying covenants and other terms. In general, the terms of our indentures, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to (i) incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) incur liens, (iv) sell assets, (v) incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, (vi) enter into affiliate transactions, (vii) engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and (viii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, under certain of our indentures, if the notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Moodys and Standard Poors (SP) and no default has occurred or is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. 505 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European and German Revolving Credit Facilities due 2012 Our amended and restated 505 million revolving credit facilities consist of a 155 million German revolving credit facility, which is only available to one of the German subsidiaries (the German borrower) of GDTE, and a 350 million European revolving credit facility, which is available to the same German borrower and to GDTE and certain of its other subsidiaries and contains a 50 million letter of credit sublimit. Goodyear and its subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. facilities provide unsecured guarantees to support the German and European revolving credit facilities and GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany also provide guarantees. GDTEs obligations under the facilities and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in a variety of collateral. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings under the German or the European revolving credit facilities. Letters of credit issued under the European revolving credit facility totaled $12 million (9 million) as of December 31, 2010 and $14 million (10 million) as of December 31, 2009. $1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013 Our $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be 50 Table of Contents increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under this facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of The Goodyear Tire Rubber Company (the Parent Company) and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors that are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $1.5 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2010, our borrowing base, and therefore our availability, under this facility was $25 million below the facilitys stated amount of $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding and $474 million and $494 million, respectively, of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. $1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014 Our amended and restated second lien term loan facility may be increased by up to $300 million at our request, subject to the consent of the lenders making additional term loans. Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien credit facility. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, this facility was fully drawn. Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European and German revolving credit facilities have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our financial condition since December 31, 2006. Each of the facilities described above have customary defaults, including cross defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and our subsidiaries. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to Covenant Compliance below and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet) GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a pan European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides up to 450 million of funding and expires in 2015. Utilization under this facility is based on current available receivable balances. The facility is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity commitments. The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. It is an event of default under the facility if the ratio of GDTEs consolidated net indebtedness to its consolidated EBITDA is greater than 3.0 to 1.0. This financial covenant is substantially similar to the covenant included in the European credit facilities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount available and fully utilized under this program totaled $319 million (238 million) and $437 million (304 million), respectively. The program did not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in long term debt and capital leases. In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have an accounts receivable securitization program totaling $72 million and $68 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The receivables sold under this program also serve as collateral for the related facility. We retain the risk of loss related to these receivables in the event of non payment. These amounts are included in Notes payable and overdrafts. 51 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet) Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2010 and 2009. For these programs, we have concluded that there is no risk of loss to us from non payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the gross amount of receivables sold was $126 million and $113 million, respectively. Other Foreign Credit Facilities Our Chinese subsidiary has two financing agreements in China. At December 31, 2010, these non revolving credit facilities had total unused availability of up to 2.6 billion renminbi ($394 million) and can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in China. The facilities contain covenants relating to our Chinese subsidiary and have customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to our Chinese subsidiarys ability to perform its obligations under the facilities. One of the facilities (with 1.7 billion renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2010) matures in 2016 and principal amortization begins in 2013. At December 31, 2010, there were $99 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. The other facility (with 900 million renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2010) matures in 2018 and principal amortization begins in 2015. At December 31, 2010, there were $54 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. There were no amounts outstanding under either of the facilities at December 31, 2009. Covenant Compliance Our amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, make certain restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. We have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows: We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company and Guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (Available Cash) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $150 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2010, our availability under this facility of $1,001 million, plus our Available Cash of $830 million, totaled $1.8 billion, which is in excess of $150 million. We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0. In addition, our 505 million senior secured European and German revolving credit facilities contain non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTEs ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, and through March 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other 52 Table of Contents consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. Our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing, and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test. There are no known future changes to, or new covenants in, any of our existing debt obligations other than as described above. Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures. The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness, Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness and Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities. Potential Future Financings In addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured. Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt. Dividends Under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied. Asset Dispositions The restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions. 53 Table of Contents COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contractual Obligations The following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2010: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2010 (In millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Beyond 2015 Debt Obligations(1) $ 4,727 $ 423 $ 97 $ 103 $ 1,207 $ 324 $ 2,573 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 18 3 4 10 1 Interest Payments(3) 2,068 313 286 274 254 241 700 Operating Leases(4) 1,322 309 249 193 144 108 319 Pension Benefits(5) 2,277 325 588 563 463 338 NA Other Postretirement Benefits(6) 471 59 55 51 49 47 210 Workers Compensation(7) 390 71 52 38 29 23 177 Binding Commitments(8) 3,326 2,719 379 150 21 16 41 Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9) 36 19 2 11 1 3 $ 14,635 $ 4,241 $ 1,712 $ 1,393 $ 2,168 $ 1,098 $ 4,023 (1) Debt obligations include Notes payable and overdrafts. (2) The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $22 million. (3) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2010 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt. (4) Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $45 million, $37 million, $27 million, $19 million, $11 million and $15 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $154 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,168 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $903 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party. (5) The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2010. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table for 2011, 2012 and 2013 represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for U.S. defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law, including the expected election of funding relief for the 2011 plan year as allowed by the Pension Relief Act; and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans. For years after 2013, the amounts shown in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans, and do not include estimates for contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our U.S. plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including: Projected Target Liability interest rate of 6.20% for 2011, 5.38% for 2012, 5.32% for 2013, 5.50% for 2014 and 5.65% for 2015, and plan asset returns of 8.5% for 2011 and beyond. 54 Table of Contents Future contributions are also affected by other factors such as: future interest rate levels, the amount and timing of asset returns, and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions. (6) The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. (7) The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $291 million. (8) Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2010. (9) These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2010. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters. Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table. In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above: The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the global alliance agreements between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements. SRIs exit rights, in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers production levels. We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements An off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has: made guarantees, retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets, 55 Table of Contents undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company. We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $26 million at December 31, 2010 and expire at various times through 2023. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words estimate, expect, intend and project, as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10 K. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including: if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected; higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expense; we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline; deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets or third party financing when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity; the challenges of the present business environment may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations; work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business; our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner; if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected; our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results; we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health; any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations; our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results; our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly; 56 Table of Contents we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales; we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims; our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded; we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity; we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results; the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of those interests; if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; and we may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Commodity Price Risk The raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, whose cost may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire. Interest Rate Risk We continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing. At December 31, 2010, 41% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 3.72% compared to 44% at an average rate of 3.13% at December 31, 2009. 57 Table of Contents The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 Carrying amount liability $ 2,691 $ 2,442 Fair value liability 2,791 2,532 Pro forma fair value liability 2,893 2,601 The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements, and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation. The following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31: (In millions) 2010 2009 Fair value asset (liability) $9 $22 Pro forma decrease in fair value (113) (106) Contract maturities 1/11 10/19 1/10 10/19 The pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models. Fair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows: (In millions) 2010 2009 Asset (liability): Accounts receivable $25 $27 Other Assets 1 1 Other current liabilities (17) (6) For further information on foreign currency contracts, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 12, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of our management of counterparty risk. 58
