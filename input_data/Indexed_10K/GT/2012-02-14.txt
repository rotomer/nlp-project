ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.OVERVIEWThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of tires, with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world. We have a broad global footprint with 53 manufacturing facilities in 22 countries, including the United States. We operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: North American Tire; Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire; Latin American Tire; and Asia Pacific Tire. We experienced uneven industry conditions in 2011 as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment, which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions and customer and consumer confidence. In emerging markets, high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions. Our tire unit shipments in 2011 were essentially flat compared to 2010, and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict. In addition, our raw material costs rose by approximately 30% in 2011 compared to 2010. We acted to address the uncertain economic environment and the challenges described above by implementing strategic initiatives aimed at permitting us to emerge stronger in the future. Under those strategic initiatives we planned to:Continue to focus on consumer driven product development;Take a selective approach to the market, targeting profitable segments where we have competitive advantages;Focus on price and product mix improvements to address rising raw material costs;Achieve cost reductions of $1.0 billion over three years from 2010 to 2012;Improve our manufacturing efficiency, including recovering unabsorbed fixed costs incurred during the recession;Focus on cash flow to provide funding for investments in future growth; andCreate an advantaged supply chain focused on optimizing inventory levels and further improving customer service. In spite of the macroeconomic and industry specific challenges we faced, we produced record net sales and segment operating income in 2011. During 2011, improved price and product mix of nearly $2.4 billion more than offset the impact of unprecedented raw material cost increases of nearly $2.0 billion on segment operating income, exclusive of approximately $177 million of raw material cost savings included in our cost savings plan described below. Price and product mix also drove a 17% improvement in revenue per tire, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting our continued focus on driving improved price and product mix through innovative product offerings in targeted market segments. In 2011, we realized approximately $281 million of cost savings, bringing the total cost savings for 2010 and 2011 to approximately $748 million. Our cost savings plan includes savings from continuous improvement initiatives, including net savings under our United Steelworkers contract, increased low cost country sourcing, and initiatives to reduce raw material costs and selling, administrative and general expense. We also recovered approximately $195 million of under absorbed fixed overhead costs in 2011 compared to 2010. Other key strategic achievements include:Continued progress on actions to reduce our high cost manufacturing capacity, including the closure of our factory in Union City, Tennessee in July 2011;Initiated production of tires at our new factory in Pulandian, China; andContinued improvements in working capital efficiency, measured as a percent of sales.For the year ended December 31, 2011, Goodyear net income was $343 million, compared to a Goodyear net loss of $216 million in 2010, and Goodyear net income available to common shareholders was $321 million, compared to a Goodyear net loss available to common shareholders of $216 million in 2010. Our total segment operating income for 2011 was $1,368 million, compared to $917 million in 2010. The increase in segment operating income was due primarily to strong price and product mix which more than offset raw material costs, a significant decrease in under absorbed fixed overhead costs due to increased production volumes, and favorable foreign currency translation. See Results of Operations Segment Information for additional information.Net sales were $22.8 billion in 2011, compared to $18.8 billion in 2010. Net sales increased due to improved price and product mix, an increase in other tire related businesses, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA and Asia Pacific Tire. Pension and Benefit PlansDuring 2011, our U.S. pension plans experienced actuarial losses from decreases in discount rates, which increased plan obligations by $452 million. In addition, the actual return on plan assets for our U.S. pension fund in 2011 was $283 million less than the expected return. These results increased actuarial net losses included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ("AOCL") by 26Table of Contents$735 million. As a result, annual U.S. net periodic pension cost will increase to approximately $200 million to $225 million in 2012 from $175 million in 2011, due primarily to amortization of higher net actuarial losses from AOCL.LiquidityAt December 31, 2011, we had $2,772 million in Cash and cash equivalents as well as $2,544 million of unused availability under our various credit agreements, compared to $2,005 million and $2,475 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the improvement in earnings compared to 2010, the net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock of $484 million, and the issuance of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due 2019. Partially offsetting these increases in Cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $1,043 million, the redemption of $350 million of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016, and working capital expenditures of $650 million. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in 2012 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment.New ProductsIn 2011, we successfully launched our new Goodyear Assurance TripleTred All Season, Goodyear Ultra Grip Ice WRT and Kelly Safari ATR tire lines in North American Tire. We also successfully launched nine new tire and retread product lines in our commercial truck tire business with three of those lines featuring SmartWay (fuel efficiency) certification and or Duraseal Technology. At our North American Tire dealer conference in early 2012, we introduced several key products, most notably the Goodyear Assurance CS TripleTred All Season and the Eagle F1 Asymmetric All Season. Additionally, we are adding key sizes of new consumer products launched in recent years.In EMEA, we launched the new Eagle F1 Asymmetric 2 summer ultra high performance tire and the Goodyear Ultra Grip 8 and Dunlop Winter Sport 4D winter tires. We have also strengthened our Max Technology commercial tire line up with a new regional haul trailer tire, RHTII, and a new line of higher load range tires that offer increased load capacity. In addition, we have upgraded our Fuel Max line with our LHS II + and LHD II + tires. In Latin American Tire, we successfully launched the Wrangler MT/R with Kevlar in the consumer market. We also launched several products using Fuel Max Technology in the commercial market, as well as expanded our commercial product lines by adding key sizes of new commercial products launched in recent years.In Asia Pacific Tire, we launched two of our leading ultra high performance tires, the Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 2 for luxury sports performance vehicles and the Goodyear Eagle F1 Directional 5 for mid range sports performance vehicles. Both of these Goodyear Eagle products are successors to previous award winning ultra high performance tires and provide superior braking and handling capabilities.OutlookIn 2012, we expect to continue to face challenges related to uneven tire industry growth and the actions we are taking globally to improve our manufacturing footprint. We expect long term growth in the global tire industry to continue, but at a slower pace near term than previously forecast due to continued economic weakness in several parts of the world, most notably in Europe. We expect that our full year tire unit volume for 2012 will be essentially flat with 2011. For the full year of 2012 in North America, we expect consumer replacement to be flat to down 2%, consumer original equipment to be flat to up 3%, commercial replacement to be up between 2% and 6% and commercial original equipment to be up between 10% and 15%. For the full year in Europe, the consumer replacement industry is expected to be flat to down 2%, consumer original equipment to be down between 5% and 9%, commercial replacement to be down between 3% and 8% and commercial original equipment to be down between 20% and 25%.27Table of Contents We expect our raw material costs in the first quarter of 2012 to increase 20% to 25% when compared with the first quarter of 2011. Smaller increases are expected for the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. For the second half of 2012, we expect raw material costs to decrease compared with the second half of 2011. For the full year of 2012, we expect our raw material costs will increase approximately 5% compared with 2011. However, natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices have experienced significant volatility, and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials. In order to mitigate some of the impact of rising raw material costs, we are continuing to focus on price and product mix, to substitute lower cost materials where possible and to work to identify additional substitution opportunities, to reduce the amount of material required in each tire, and to pursue alternative raw materials including innovative bio based materials. However, during periods of rapidly rising raw material costs, we may not be able to fully offset those raw material cost increases through the use of these strategies, although we remain confident in our ability to do so over the longer term. As a result of the closure of our Union City, Tennessee manufacturing facility, we now expect to recover approximately $40 million to $60 million of unabsorbed fixed costs in 2012, net of the impact of anticipated production cuts due to flat tire unit volume. We also expect to reduce costs by approximately $250 million in 2012. As a partial offset to these benefits, we expect to incur approximately $40 million to $60 million of additional costs related to start up expenses for our new Pulandian, China manufacturing facility and under absorbed overhead costs related to the closure of our Dalian, China manufacturing facility in 2012.See Item 1A. Risk Factors at page 11 for a discussion of the factors that may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and Forward Looking Information Safe Harbor Statement at page 51 for a discussion of our use of forward looking statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATEDAll per share amounts are diluted and refer to Goodyear net income (loss) available to common shareholders.2011 Compared to 2010 For the year ended December 31, 2011, Goodyear net income was $343 million, or $1.32 per share, compared to net loss of $216 million, or $0.89 per share, in 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011 Goodyear net income available to common shareholders was $321 million, or $1.26 per share, reflecting $22 million of preferred stock dividends, compared to a Goodyear net loss available to common shareholders of $216 million, or $0.89 per share, in 2010.Net SalesNet sales in 2011 of $22.8 billion increased $3.9 billion, or 20.9%, compared to 2010 due primarily to favorable changes in price and product mix of $2.6 billion, increased sales in other tire related businesses of $875 million, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products, and $599 million due to favorable foreign currency translation. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2011 were $12.1 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Consumer and commercial net sales in 2010 were $10.3 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.The following table presents our tire unit sales for the periods indicated: Year Ended December 31,(In millions of tires)2011 2010 % ChangeReplacement Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada)50.0 50.8 (1.6)%International82.2 82.2 %Total132.2 133.0 (0.7)%OE Units North American Tire (U.S. and Canada)16.0 15.9 1.3 %International32.4 31.9 1.6 %Total48.4 47.8 1.5 %Goodyear worldwide tire units180.6 180.8 (0.1)%28Table of ContentsThe decrease in worldwide tire unit sales of 0.2 million units, or 0.1%, compared to 2010, included a decrease of 0.8 million replacement units, or 0.7%, due primarily to a decrease in the consumer replacement business in North American Tire due to lower industry demand and a decrease in Latin American Tire, primarily in consumer replacement, partially offset by an increase of 0.6 million units, or 1.5%, in OE units, primarily in EMEA. EMEA OE volume increased 1.1 million units, or 6.7%, due to increased demand in both our consumer and commercial businesses due to increased vehicle production. Consumer and commercial units in 2011 were 163.6 million and 14.8 million, respectively. Consumer and commercial units in 2010 were 164.4 million and 14.0 million, respectively.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold (CGS) was $18.8 billion in 2011, increasing $3.4 billion, or 21.8%, compared to 2010. CGS in 2011 increased due primarily to higher raw material costs of $1.8 billion, higher costs in other tire related businesses of $826 million, primarily in North American Tires cost of chemical products, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $453 million, and product mix related cost increases of $229 million. CGS was favorably impacted by decreased conversion costs of $19 million. The lower conversion costs were caused primarily by lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $195 million due to higher production volume and savings from rationalization plans of $55 million, which were partially offset by incremental start up costs for our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China of $40 million, inflationary cost increases and higher profit sharing costs in North American Tire of $55 million. CGS in 2011 included $4 million ($4 million after tax or $0.01 per share) in charges related to tornado damage at our manufacturing facility in Fayetteville, North Carolina. CGS in 2011 also included charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $50 million ($48 million after tax or $0.18 per share), compared to $15 million in 2010 ($11 million after tax or $0.05 per share). The increase in accelerated depreciation and asset write offs in 2011 was due primarily to the closure of our manufacturing facility in Union City, Tennessee. CGS in 2010 also included gains from supplier settlements of $12 million ($8 million after tax or $0.03 per share), expense due to a supplier disruption of $4 million ($4 million after tax or $0.02 per share), a one time importation cost adjustment of $3 million ($3 million after tax or $0.01 per share), and the impact of a strike in South Africa of $3 million ($3 million after tax or $0.01 per share). CGS was 82.7% of sales in 2011 compared to 82.1% in 2010.Selling, Administrative and General ExpenseSelling, administrative and general expense (SAG) was $2.8 billion in 2011, increasing $192 million, or 7.3%, compared to 2010. SAG increased due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation of $89 million, higher advertising and marketing expenses of $79 million, increased wages and benefits of $77 million, and increased warehousing costs of $13 million. Lower general and product liability expense of $52 million in North American Tire served to partially offset the increase. SAG benefited from savings from rationalization plans of $20 million. SAG in 2010 included an insurance recovery of $8 million ($8 million after tax or $0.03 per share). SAG in 2011 was 12.4% of sales, compared to 14.0% in 2010.RationalizationsTo maintain global competitiveness, we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years to reduce excess and high cost manufacturing capacity and to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses through associate headcount reductions. We recorded net rationalization charges of $103 million in 2011 ($95 million after tax or $0.35 per share). Rationalization actions initiated in 2011 consisted of headcount reductions in EMEA and Asia Pacific Tire and actions in connection with the relocation of our manufacturing facility in Dalian, China to Pulandian, China. We recorded net rationalization charges of $240 million in 2010 ($225 million after tax or $0.93 per share). Rationalization actions initiated in 2010 consisted of the plan to close our manufacturing facility in Union City, Tennessee, the consolidation of several warehouses in North American Tire, an increase in costs related to the discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France, and the closure of a manufacturing facility in Taiwan.Upon completion of the 2011 plans, we estimate that annual operating costs will be reduced by approximately $15 million ($1 million CGS and $14 million SAG). The savings realized in 2011 for the 2011 plans totaled $2 million ($1 million CGS and $1 million SAG). In addition, savings realized in 2011 for the 2010 plans totaled $19 million ($8 million CGS and $11 million SAG).For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 2, Costs Associated with Rationalization Programs.Interest ExpenseInterest expense was $330 million in 2011, increasing $14 million from $316 million in 2010. The increase relates primarily to higher average debt balances of $5,411 million in 2011 compared to $4,701 million in 2010, partially offset by a decrease in 29Table of Contentsaverage interest rates of 6.10% in 2011 compared to 6.72% in 2010.Other ExpenseOther Expense in 2011 was $73 million, improving $113 million from $186 million in 2010. Net foreign currency exchange losses in 2011 were $27 million compared to $159 million in 2010. The 2010 period included a first quarter foreign exchange loss of $110 million ($99 million after tax or $0.41 per share) resulting from the January 8, 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar and a fourth quarter foreign exchange loss of $24 million ($20 million after tax or $0.08 per share) in connection with the January 1, 2011 elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure, which was announced by the Venezuelan government in December 2010. For further discussion on Venezuela, refer to "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview." Foreign currency exchange also reflected net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide.Financing fees in 2011 of $89 million included $53 million ($53 million after tax or $0.20 per share) related to the redemption of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 10.5% senior notes due 2016, of which $37 million related to a cash premium paid on the redemption and $16 million related to the write off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discount. Net gains on asset sales were $16 million ($8 million after tax or $0.03 per share) in 2011 compared to net gains on asset sales of $73 million ($48 million after tax or $0.20 per share) in 2010. Net gains in 2011 related primarily to the sale of land in Malaysia and the sale of the farm tire business in Latin America. Net gains in 2010 related primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand and the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of a warehouse in Guatemala in 2008. The 2011 period also included charges of $13 million for an asbestos accrual adjustment related to prior periods and $9 million for the insurance deductible related to flood damage to our manufacturing facility in Thailand. Refer to "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segment Information Asia Pacific Tire" for further information. The 2010 period also included a charge of $25 million ($18 million after tax or $0.07 per share) related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior years.For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other Expense.Income TaxesTax expense in 2011 was $201 million on income before income taxes of $618 million. For 2010, tax expense was $172 million on income before income taxes of $8 million primarily driven by a U.S. loss of $529 million with no tax benefit. For the year ending December 31, 2010, our income tax expense or benefit was allocated among operations and items charged or credited directly to shareholders equity. Pursuant to this allocation requirement, a $9 million ($9 million after minority or $0.04 per share) non cash tax benefit was allocated to the loss from our U.S. operations, with offsetting tax expense allocated to items, primarily attributable to employee benefits, charged directly to shareholders equity. Income tax expense in 2011 also included net tax benefits of $36 million ($42 million after minority or $0.16 per share) primarily related to a $64 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on our Canadian operations and a $24 million charge related to the settlement of prior tax years and to increase tax reserves as a result of negative tax court rulings in a foreign jurisdiction. Income tax expense in 2010 included net tax benefits of $33 million related to a $16 million benefit for enacted tax law changes and $20 million of tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above.Our losses in various taxing jurisdictions in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require us to maintain a full valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets. In certain foreign locations, it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence required to release all, or a portion, of these valuation allowances within the next 12 months will exist, however, we do not expect these possible one time tax benefits to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operation.For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.Minority Shareholders Net IncomeMinority shareholders net income was $74 million in 2011, compared to $52 million in 2010. The increase was due primarily to increased earnings in our joint venture in Europe.30Table of Contents2010 Compared to 2009For the year ended December 31, 2010, Goodyear net loss was $216 million, or $0.89 per share, compared to $375 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2009.Net SalesNet sales in 2010 of $18.8 billion increased $2.5 billion, or 15.5%, compared to 2009 due primarily to increased tire volume of $1,044 million, primarily in North American Tire and EMEA, $867 million due to favorable changes in price and product mix, and increased sales in other tire related businesses of $582 million, primarily in North American Tires third party sales of chemical products.

The 2010 period included a first quarter foreign exchange loss of $110 million ($99 million after tax or $0.41 per share) resulting from the January 8, 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar and a fourth quarter foreign exchange loss of $24 million ($20 million after tax or $0.08 per share) in connection with the January 1, 2011 elimination of the two tier exchange rate structure, which was announced by the Venezuelan government in December 2010. Foreign currency exchange also reflected net gains and losses resulting from the effect of exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide.Financing fees in 2010 of $95 million included $56 million ($56 million after tax or $0.23 per share) related to the redemption of $973 million of long term debt, of which $50 million were cash premiums paid on the redemption and $6 million were financing fees which were written off. Also included in financing fees were costs related to a debt exchange offer of $5 million ($5 million after tax or $0.02 per share).Net gains on asset sales were $73 million ($48 million after tax or $0.20 per share) in 2010 compared to net losses on asset sales of $30 million ($30 million after tax or $0.13 per share) in 2009. Net gains in 2010 related primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand and the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of a warehouse in Guatemala in 2008. Net losses in 2009 were due primarily to the sale of certain of our properties in Akron, Ohio that comprise our current headquarters in connection with the development of a new headquarters in Akron, Ohio.The 2010 period also included a charge of $25 million ($18 million after tax or $0.07 per share) related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior years.For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 3, Other Expense.Income TaxesTax expense in 2010 was $172 million on income before income taxes of $8 million primarily driven by a U.S. loss of $529 million with no tax benefit. For 2009, tax expense was $7 million on a loss before income taxes of $357 million. For the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, our income tax expense or benefit was allocated among operations and items charged or credited directly to shareholders equity. Pursuant to this allocation requirement, a $9 million ($9 million after minority or $0.04 per share) and $100 million ($100 million after minority or $0.42 per share), respectively, non cash tax benefit has been allocated to the loss from our U.S. operations, with offsetting tax expense allocated to items, primarily attributable to employee benefits, charged directly to shareholders equity. Income tax expense in 2010 also included net tax benefits of $33 million ($31 million after minority or $0.13 per share) primarily related to a $16 million benefit on enacted tax law changes and $20 million of tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. Income tax expense in 2009 also included net tax benefits of $42 million ($42 million after minority or $0.18 per share) primarily related to a $29 million benefit resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on our Australian operations and a $19 million benefit resulting from the settlement of our 1997 through 2003 Competent Authority claim between the United States and Canada.32Table of ContentsThe difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate was due primarily to our continuing to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net Federal and state deferred tax assets and the adjustments discussed above.For further information, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.Minority Shareholders Net IncomeMinority shareholders net income was $52 million in 2010, compared to $11 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to increased earnings in our joint venture in Europe.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SEGMENT INFORMATIONSegment information reflects our strategic business units (SBUs), which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis.Results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income. Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions. Segment operating income is computed as follows: Net Sales less CGS (excluding asset write off and accelerated depreciation charges) and SAG (including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses). Segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates. Segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges (credits), asset sales and certain other items.Total segment operating income was $1,368 million in 2011, $917 million in 2010 and $372 million in 2009. Total segment operating margin (segment operating income divided by segment sales) in 2011 was 6.0%, compared to 4.9% in 2010 and 2.3% in 2009.Management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our SBUs and excludes items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. Total segment operating income is the sum of the individual SBUs segment operating income. Refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments, for further information and for a reconciliation of total segment operating income to Income (Loss) before Income Taxes.North American Tire Year Ended December 31,(In millions)2011 2010 2009Tire Units66.0 66.7 62.7Net Sales$9,859 $8,205 $6,977Operating Income (Loss)276 18 (305)Operating Margin2.8% 0.2% (4.4)%2011 Compared to 2010 North American Tire unit sales in 2011 decreased 0.7 million units, or 0.9%, from the 2010 period. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in replacement volume of 0.8 million units, or 1.6%, primarily in our consumer business reflecting lower industry demand. OE volume remained relatively flat with increases in our commercial business offsetting decreases in our consumer business.Net sales in 2011 were $9,859 million, increasing $1,654 million, or 20.2%, compared to $8,205 million in 2010 due primarily to improved price and product mix of $1,000 million, increased sales in other tire related businesses of $677 million primarily related to an increase in the price and volume of third party sales of chemical products, and favorable foreign currency translation of $28 million. Lower sales volume of $54 million partially offset these improvements.Operating income in 2011 was $276 million, improving $258 million from $18 million in 2010. Price and product mix improved $883 million, which more than offset raw material cost increases of $706 million. Operating income also benefited from decreased SAG expenses of $53 million, increased operating income in our other tire related businesses of $30 million driven by increased profits for our aviation products and in our retail tire businesses, and favorable foreign currency translation of $12 million. Conversion costs, which were flat compared to the prior year, benefited from lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $96 million due to higher production volume and decreased pension expense of $35 million. These benefits were offset by higher profit sharing costs of $55 million, increased workers compensation of $15 million, and inflation. Lower 33Table of Contentsvolume of $5 million served to partially offset the improvement in operating income. The decrease in SAG expense was driven by lower general and product liability expenses of $52 million. Conversion costs and SAG expenses included savings from rationalization plans of $16 million and $11 million, respectively.Operating income in 2011 excluded net rationalization charges of $72 million and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $43 million, primarily related to the closure of our Union City, Tennessee manufacturing facility, and net losses on asset sales of $2 million. Operating income in 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $2 million, primarily related to the closure of our Union City, Tennessee manufacturing facility, and net gains on asset sales of $2 million.2010 Compared to 2009North American Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 4.0 million units, or 6.3%, from the 2009 period. The increase was primarily related to an increase in OE volume of 3.2 million units, or 25.4%, primarily in our consumer business, due to increased vehicle production. Replacement volume increased 0.8 million units, or 1.4%, due primarily to improved industry volumes driven by economic growth.Net sales in 2010 increased $1,228 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2009 due primarily to increased sales in other tire related businesses of $610 million, primarily related to an increase in the price and volume of third party sales of chemical products. Higher tire volume of $304 million, improved price and product mix of $269 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $39 million also contributed to the growth in net sales.Operating income in 2010 was $18 million, improving $323 million from a loss of $305 million in 2009. Price and product mix improved $260 million, which more than offset raw material cost increases of $177 million. Operating income also benefited from lower conversion costs of $171 million, increased operating income in our other tire related business of $47 million, primarily related to sales of chemical products, higher tire volume of $26 million and lower transportation costs of $20 million. The decrease in conversion costs was primarily driven by lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $119 million due to higher production volume and savings from rationalization plans of $55 million. Lower employee benefit costs and productivity improvements were offset by inflation and higher profit sharing costs. SAG expense increased $15 million driven by increased advertising costs of $15 million and higher general and product liability expenses of $14 million partially offset by savings from rationalization plans of $8 million and lower bad debt expense of $6 million.Operating income in 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $184 million primarily related to the closure of our Union City, Tennessee manufacturing facility, net gains on asset sales of $2 million and charges for accelerated depreciation of $2 million. Operating loss in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $112 million, charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $16 million, and net gains on asset sales of $4 million.Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire Year Ended December 31,(In millions)2011 2010 2009Tire Units74.3 72.0 66.0Net Sales$8,040 $6,407 $5,801Operating Income627 319 166Operating Margin7.8% 5.0% 2.9%2011 Compared to 2010 Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2011 increased 2.3 million units, or 3.2%, to 74.3 million units. Replacement volume increased 1.2 million units, or 2.2%, primarily in the consumer business, due to improved economic conditions during the first nine months of the year and strong winter tire sales. OE volume increased 1.1 million units, or 6.7%, driven by increased demand in both our consumer and commercial businesses due to increased vehicle production. Net sales in 2011 were $8,040 million, increasing $1,633 million, or 25.5%, compared to $6,407 million in 2010, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $1,031 million and higher volume of $170 million. These increases were accompanied by favorable foreign currency translation of $342 million and higher sales by other tire related businesses of $90 million, primarily in our retail and retread businesses.Operating income in 2011 was $627 million, increasing $308 million, or 96.6%, compared to $319 million in 2010, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $930 million which offset higher raw material costs of $651 million, lower 34Table of Contentsconversion costs of $79 million, increased volume of $34 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $24 million. Conversion costs decreased due primarily to lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $89 million due to higher production volume partially offset by increases in wages and general inflation. Operating income was unfavorably affected by higher SAG expenses of $91 million. SAG expenses increased primarily due to increased advertising and marketing expenses of $66 million, higher wages and benefits of $25 million and increased warehousing costs of $13 million. Conversion costs and SAG expenses included savings from rationalization plans of $17 million and $5 million, respectively.Operating income in 2011 excluded net rationalization charges of $15 million and net gains on asset sales of $1 million. Operating income in 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $41 million, net gains on asset sales of $6 million and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $1 million.EMEAs results are highly dependent upon Germany, which accounted for approximately 37% and 35% of EMEAs net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Germany will have a significant impact on EMEAs future performance. In addition, the sale of the European farm tire business to Titan Tire Corporation was subject to the exercise of a put option by us following completion of a social plan related to the previously announced discontinuation of consumer tire production at one of our facilities in Amiens, France and required consultation with various works councils. The put option expired on November 30, 2011. Titan is no longer obligated to purchase our European farm tire business, and we do not have an anticipated time frame in which we expect to complete that sale.2010 Compared to 2009Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 6.0 million units, or 9.0%, from the 2009 period. OE volume increased 3.2 million units, or 24.4%, primarily in our consumer business, due to increased vehicle production. Replacement volume increased 2.8 million units, or 5.2%, primarily in the consumer business, due to improved economic conditions and a strong winter season.Net sales in 2010 increased $606 million, or 10.4%, compared to 2009, due primarily to higher volume of $454 million and improved price and product mix of $356 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $193 million.Operating income in 2010 increased $153 million, or 92.2%, compared to 2009, due primarily to lower conversion costs of $174 million and increased volume of $118 million. Conversion costs decreased due primarily to lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $108 million due to higher production volume. Operating income was unfavorably affected by higher raw material costs of $182 million, which were partially offset by improved price and product mix of $131 million, higher SAG expenses of $73 million, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $17 million. SAG expenses increased due to higher wages and benefits of $35 million and increased advertising expenses of $26 million. Conversion costs and SAG expenses included savings from rationalization plans of $12 million and $7 million, respectively.Operating income in 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $41 million, net gains on asset sales of $6 million and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $1 million. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $82 million and net gains on asset sales of $1 million.Latin American Tire Year Ended December 31,(In millions)2011 2010 2009Tire Units19.8 20.7 19.1Net Sales$2,472 $2,158 $1,814Operating Income231 330 301Operating Margin9.3% 15.3% 16.6%2011 Compared to 2010 Latin American Tire unit sales in 2011 decreased 0.9 million units, or 4.8%, from the 2010 period. Replacement tire volume decreased 0.9 million units, or 7.0%, primarily in the lower end of the consumer tire market due to competition from increased imports of tires from Asia, while OE tire volume was flat.Net sales in 2011 were $2,472 million, increasing $314 million, or 14.6%, from $2,158 million in 2010. Net sales increased due primarily to improved price and product mix of $296 million, increased sales by other tire related businesses of $99 million 35Table of Contentsand favorable foreign currency translation of $82 million, mainly in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by lower volume of $97 million and the divestiture of the farm tire business, which reduced sales by $67 million.Operating income in 2011 was $231 million, decreasing $99 million, or 30.0%, from $330 million in 2010. Operating income decreased due primarily to higher conversion costs of $61 million, lower tire volume of $30 million, the impact of the April 1, 2011 farm tire business divestiture of $25 million, and higher SAG expenses of $19 million, primarily driven by increased wages and benefits of $12 million and equity based taxes of $5 million. These decreases were partially offset by improved price and product mix of $266 million, which more than offset increased raw material costs of $249 million, favorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, higher operating income from other tire related businesses of $3 million and higher operating income from intersegment sales. The higher conversion costs were primarily driven by wage inflation, a depreciation adjustment related to prior periods of $8 million, an increase of $5 million driven by a first quarter 2010 adjustment of a legal claim reserve for payroll taxes, and ramp up costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing facility in Chile. Conversion costs included lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of approximately $16 million. Conversion costs and SAG expenses included savings from rationalization plans of $22 million and $4 million, respectively. Operating income in 2011 excluded net gains on asset sales of $4 million. Operating income in 2010 excluded a charge of $25 million related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior periods, net gains on asset sales of $7 million, and net rationalization charges of $5 million. In addition, a $134 million foreign currency exchange loss in Venezuela was also excluded from operating income in 2010. Latin American Tires results are highly dependent upon Brazil, which accounted for 58% and 61% of Latin American Tires net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Lower operating income in Brazil in 2011, primarily due to competition from increased imports of tires from Asia, increased raw material costs and inflationary cost increases, drove the year over year decline in segment operating income in 2011.Goodyear Venezuela also contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2011 and 2010. For further information see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview in this Form 10 K.2010 Compared to 2009Latin American Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 1.6 million units, or 8.5%, from the 2009 period. Replacement tire volume increased 0.9 million units, or 6.7%, reflecting increased volume in both consumer and commercial businesses. OE volume increased 0.7 million units, or 12.3%, due primarily to an increase in our consumer business.Net sales in 2010 increased $344 million, or 19.0%, from the 2009 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $219 million and increased volume of $128 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $30 million which included $192 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte.Operating income in 2010 increased $29 million, or 9.6%, from the same period in 2009, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $188 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $84 million, and lower conversion costs of $24 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, higher SAG costs of $26 million, and lower profitability on intersegment transfers of $24 million. Higher SAG expenses included higher wages and benefits of $13 million and higher warehousing expenses of $11 million. Conversion costs included lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $41 million and savings from rationalization plans of $8 million. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating income by approximately $85 million as compared to 2009.Operating income in 2010 excluded a charge of $25 million related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior periods, net gains on asset sales of $7 million, and net rationalization charges of $5 million. In addition, a $134 million foreign currency exchange loss in Venezuela also is excluded from operating income in 2010. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $20 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million. In addition, operating income excluded charges of $18 million in 2009 resulting from the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses in connection with the liquidation of our subsidiary in Guatemala. 36Table of ContentsAsia Pacific Tire Year Ended December 31,(In millions)2011 2010 2009Tire Units20.5 21.4 19.2Net Sales$2,396 $2,062 $1,709Operating Income234 250 210Operating Margin9.8% 12.1% 12.3%2011 Compared to 2010 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2011 decreased 0.9 million units, or 4.2%, from the 2010 period. OE volume decreased by 0.6 million units, or 6.5%, primarily in the consumer business and replacement volume decreased by 0.3 million units, or 2.6%. Decreases in OE unit sales were primarily caused by supply disruptions at OE manufacturers as a result of the natural disaster in Japan as well as flooding in Thailand. Declines in replacement unit sales in Australia and New Zealand, which were affected by a continued weak retail environment, and in Thailand, which was impacted by flooding, more than offset increased replacement unit sales in China and India. Net sales in 2011 were $2,396 million, increasing $334 million, or 16.2%, from $2,062 million in the 2010 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $258 million and foreign currency translation of $147 million, primarily in Australia and China, which more than offset the impact of lower volume of $64 million.Operating income in 2011 was $234 million, decreasing $16 million, or 6.4%, from $250 million in 2010, due primarily to an increase in start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China of approximately $40 million, higher conversion costs of $13 million, lower volume of $12 million, higher SAG costs of $15 million and higher transportation costs of $6 million. These impacts were partially offset by improved price and product mix of $277 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $216 million, and favorable foreign currency translation of $17 million. The flooding of our factory in Thailand in the fourth quarter of 2011 reduced volume and increased conversion costs, which negatively impacted operating income by approximately $12 million.Operating income in 2011 and 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $16 million and $11 million, respectively, and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $7 million and $12 million, respectively. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $9 million in 2011, due primarily to the sale of land in Malaysia, and $58 million in 2010, due primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand. Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 44% and 43% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. In 2012, start up expenses at our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China and under absorbed overhead costs at our Dalian, China manufacturing facility that is expected to be closed in the second half of 2012 are anticipated to adversely impact Asia Pacific Tires operating income by $40 million to $60 million compared to 2011. Following severe flooding in Thailand, we closed our consumer and aviation tire manufacturing facility in Bangkok in October 2011. The floodwaters that idled the plant receded in late November 2011, allowing us to make an assessment of the damage. In addition to the approximate $12 million impact on segment operating income, we recorded charges of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2011 in Other Expense, representing our deductible under an insurance policy. In the aggregate, our fourth quarter results of operations were negatively affected by approximately $21 million ($16 million after tax, or $0.07 per share). Restoration of our facility has commenced and we expect to resume production of aviation and consumer tires during the first quarter, ramping up to full production during the second quarter. As a result, we expect our first half of 2012 production and sales to be adversely affected. Over time, we do not expect the impact on our results of operations to be material due to available insurance coverage; however, the timing of recognition of insurance recoveries may lag the recording of incurred losses.37Table of Contents2010 Compared to 2009Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 2.2 million units, or 11.6%, from the 2009 period. OE volumes increased 1.6 million units, or 22.5%, primarily in the consumer business, and replacement unit sales increased 0.6 million units, or 5.2%. The increase in units was due to growth in vehicle production in China and India.Net sales in 2010 increased $353 million, or 20.7%, compared to the 2009 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $172 million, increased volume of $158 million and improved price and product mix of $23 million.Operating income in 2010 increased $40 million, or 19.0%, compared to the 2009 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $110 million, which offset higher raw material costs of $106 million, increased volume of $32 million, favorable foreign currency translation of $21 million and decreased conversion costs of $19 million. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $16 million and lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $10 million. Operating income was adversely affected by start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China of approximately $10 million and higher SAG costs of $22 million, including increased wages and benefits of $9 million. Operating income in 2009 included a gain of $7 million from insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2007.Operating income in 2010 and 2009 excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $12 million and $26 million, respectively, and net rationalization charges of $11 million and $10 million, respectively. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $58 million and $5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand in 2010.38Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to:general and product liability and other litigation,workers compensation,recoverability of goodwill,deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions, andpensions and other postretirement benefits.General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts.A significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $138 million at December 31, 2011. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was $64 million. At December 31, 2011, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities, net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries, could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately $10 million.We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements, and also have excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors.As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $67 million, and we expect that approximately 50% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. Of this amount, $8 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts receivable at December 31, 2011. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $302 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers compensation claims at December 31, 2011. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return.For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.39Table of ContentsRecoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $654 million at December 31, 2011.We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units: North American Tire, Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, Latin American Tire and Asia Pacific Tire. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units. There have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in 2011.FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2011 08 Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topics was issued in September 2011 and allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and if a quantitative assessment should be performed. We adopted this standard update in the third quarter in connection with our July 31, 2011 annual impairment assessment and performed a qualitative analysis. After considering changes to assumptions used in the prior year test, including the capital markets environment, global economic conditions, tire industry competition and trends, and improvements in our results of operations, as well as the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our 2010 annual testing of 40% for North American Tire, over 45% for EMEA and over 20% for Asia Pacific Tire, and other factors, we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was not less than its carrying value and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative analysis. Accordingly, the annual impairment test at July 31, 2011 indicated there was no impairment of goodwill. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2011, we had valuation allowances aggregating $3.1 billion against all of our net Federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets.We assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in the U.S. and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal, state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including:life expectancies,retirement rates,discount rates,long term rates of return on plan assets,inflation rates,future compensation levels,future health care costs, andmaximum company covered benefit costs.Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated Aa 40Table of Contentsor higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over a period of 15 years or more, estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected.The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.52% and 4.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2011, compared to 5.20% and 4.62% for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2011 was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $283 million in 2011, compared to $296 million in 2010 and $314 million in 2009. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $30 million in 2011, compared to $33 million in 2010 and $32 million in 2009. The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation, shareholders equity, and 2012 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: + / Change at December 31, 2011(Dollars in millions)Change PBO/ABO Equity 2012 ExpensePensions: Assumption: Discount rate+/ 0.5% $337 $337 $12Actual 2011 return on assets+/ 1.0% N/A 36 6Expected return on assets+/ 1.0% N/A N/A 35Other Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate+/ 0.5% $11 $11 $Health care cost trends total cost+/ 1.0% 3 3 A significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $2,900 million in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2011 is a result of plan asset losses and the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining our 2011 U.S. net periodic pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $134 million of the net actuarial loss in 2011. We will recognize approximately $183 million of net actuarial losses in 2012. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2011, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2012 before it begins to gradually decline.The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 0.7%, 14.4% and 25.6% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 8.50% for all three years. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans.We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2011 and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $185 million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2011 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. The net actuarial loss increased from 2010 due to the decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2011. For purposes of determining 2011 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $10 million of the net actuarial losses in 2011. We will recognize approximately $12 million of net actuarial losses in 2012. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2011, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2012 before it begins to gradually decline.The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. plans is approximately 14 years.For further information on pensions and other postretirement benefits, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans.41Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOVERVIEWOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We experienced uneven industry conditions in 2011 as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment, which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions. In emerging markets, high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions. In 2011, we took several actions to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity, including the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, the redemption of a portion of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016 with the proceeds of that equity offering, the refinancing of our European revolving credit facility and the issuance of euro denominated notes by GDTE. At December 31, 2011, we had solid liquidity, with approximately $5.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and unused availability under our credit facilities.For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2011, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview.At December 31, 2011, we had $2,772 million in Cash and cash equivalents, compared to $2,005 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $773 million. Net income of $417 million and non cash depreciation and amortization of $715 million were partially offset by working capital expenditures of $650 million. Higher raw material costs and increased selling prices drove the increase in working capital, while higher inventory units to support customer service levels and weaker industry sales in the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, also contributed. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used by investing activities was $902 million and net cash provided by financing activities was $994 million. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock of $484 million and the issuance of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due 2019. Partially offsetting these increases in Cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $1,043 million and the redemption of $350 million of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $2,544 million and $2,475 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31:(In millions)2011 2010First lien revolving credit facility$1,093 $1,001European revolving credit facility511 664Chinese credit facilities188 394Other domestic and international debt410 158Notes payable and overdrafts342 258 $2,544 $2,475At December 31, 2011, our unused availability included $188 million that can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in China. These credit facilities, along with government grants, should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility. There were $389 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2011.We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs.42Table of ContentsIn 2012, we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $550 million to $600 million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $360 million and $385 million and, when and if future dividends are declared, dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock to be $29 million. We intend to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations. The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (the Pension Relief Act) provides funding relief for defined benefit pension plan sponsors by deferring near term contributions. As allowed by the Pension Relief Act, we elected funding relief for the 2009 and 2011 plan years. Funding relief delays certain funding requirements for the elected plan years to years after 2014 and is expected to reduce our total U.S. pension contributions in 2011 to 2014 by approximately $275 million to $325 million. Current low interest rates have increased our funding requirements, thereby offsetting much of the benefit provided by funding relief. We currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans of approximately $425 million to $450 million in 2012 and $425 million to $475 million in 2013. If the current low interest rate environment continues without funding stabilization legislation, we will experience additional increases in our funding obligations in 2014. For additional information, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. SRI has certain minority exit rights that, if triggered and exercised, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. As of the date of this filing, SRI has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable.Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as China, Venezuela, and South Africa, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Chinese, Venezuelan and South African subsidiaries, that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2011, approximately $647 million of net assets, including $534 million of cash and cash equivalents, were subject to such requirements, including $291 million of cash in Venezuela. The requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of China and South Africa have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy was considered to be highly inflationary under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of 100% over the latest three year period, based upon the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary. All gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since January 1, 2010 were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in Other Expense. Venezuela remained a highly inflationary economy for U.S. GAAP purposes during 2011.On January 8, 2010, Venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods. For essential goods the official exchange rate was 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. On January 1, 2011, the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated. For our unsettled amounts at December 31, 2010 and going forward, the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar is expected to be used for substantially all goods.43Table of ContentsThe $110 million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of 2010 primarily consisted of a $157 million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, at the time of the January 2010 devaluation. The loss was primarily related to cash deposits in Venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods, and was partially offset by a $47 million subsidy receivable related to U.S. dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods. Since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate, we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates. Throughout 2010, we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable, and a substantial portion of purchases by our Venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods. As a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at December 31, 2010. If in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the Statement of Operations. At December 31, 2011, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $317 million, which consisted primarily of $291 million of cash, $18 million of deferred tax assets and $8 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $152 million which consisted primarily of $92 million of intercompany payables, including $59 million of dividends, $24 million of accounts payable trade, $15 million of compensation and benefits and $14 million of income taxes payable. At December 31, 2010, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $210 million, which consisted primarily of $188 million of cash, $18 million of deferred tax assets and $4 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $75 million which consisted primarily of $48 million of intercompany payables, including $31 million of dividends, $12 million of accounts payable trade and $7 million of compensation and benefits. All monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 and 2010.Goodyear Venezuelas sales were 1.5% and 1.2% of our net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Goodyear Venezuelas cost of goods sold was 1.2% and 0.9% of our cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Goodyear Venezuelas sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately 55% bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately 45% U.S. dollar denominated. A further 10% decrease in the bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar would decrease Goodyear Venezuelas sales and increase cost of goods sold by approximately $39 million and approximately $26 million, respectively, on an annual basis.During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, Goodyear Venezuela settled $91 million and $12 million, respectively, of U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 92% of those payables were settled at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and 8% were settled at the essential goods rate of 2.6 bolivar fuertes to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2011, settlements of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were $159 million, all of which are expected to settle at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2011, $81 million of the requested settlements were pending up to 180 days, less than $1 million were pending from 180 to 360 days and $78 million were pending over one year. Amounts pending up to 180 days include imported tires and raw materials of $43 million and dividends payable of $28 million, and amounts pending over one year include dividends payable of $31 million, imported tires of $17 million and intercompany charges for royalties of $17 million. Currency exchange controls in Venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from Venezuela.Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2011 and 2010. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions and operational disruptions in Venezuela adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating income in 2010. We continue to face operational challenges in Venezuela, including inflationary cost pressures, high absenteeism, and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods. In response to conditions in Venezuela, we continue to evaluate the need to adjust prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges, including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires. Our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material and other production costs, market demand and adherence to government price controls. For a discussion of the risks related to our international operations, including Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2012 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position, which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. However, the challenges we face may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of these challenges.44Table of ContentsCash PositionAt December 31, 2011, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts:$793 million or 29% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Luxembourg and South Africa ($415 million or 21% at December 31, 2010),$430 million or 16% in Asia, primarily China, Australia and India ($393 million or 20% at December 31, 2010), and$527 million or 19% in Latin America, primarily Venezuela and Brazil ($368 million or 18% at December 31, 2010).Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operations was $773 million in 2011, compared to $924 million in 2010 and $1,297 million in 2009. Operating cash flows in 2011 were favorably impacted by the improvement in earnings compared to 2010. Net cash used by working capital was $650 million in 2011, compared to net cash provided of $52 million and $1,081 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash used for working capital in 2011 was due primarily to higher raw material costs and increased selling prices, while higher inventory units to support customer service levels and weaker industry sales in the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, also contributed.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $902 million in 2011, compared to $859 million in 2010 and $663 million in 2009. Capital expenditures were $1,043 million in 2011, compared to $944 million in 2010 and $746 million in 2009. Capital expenditures in 2011 increased from 2010 due primarily to the expansion of manufacturing capacity in China and Chile. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 primarily related to projects targeted at increasing our capacity for high value added tires, which were scaled back in 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions. Investing cash flows in 2011 included cash inflows of $95 million from government grants related to the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in China. Investing cash flows also reflect cash provided from the disposition of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs and the divestiture of non core assets.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $994 million in 2011, compared to $179 million in 2010 and net cash used of $654 million in 2009. Financing activities in 2011 included $484 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of $562 million to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures. Included in these net borrowings were the issuance by GDTE of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due 2019 and the redemption of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 10.5% senior notes due 2016.Credit SourcesIn aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $8,129 million available at December 31, 2011, of which $2,544 million were unused, compared to $7,689 million available at December 31, 2010, of which $2,475 million were unused. At December 31, 2011, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $7,531 million, of which $2,202 million were unused, compared to $7,193 million and $2,217 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $598 million, of which $342 million were unused, compared to $496 million and $258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time.See the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments for a discussion of the redemption of a portion of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016, the amendment and restatement of our European revolving credit facility and the issuance of 250 million of GDTE 6.75% senior notes due 2019. See the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 20, Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for a discussion of the issuance of our 5.875% mandatory convertible preferred stock.Outstanding NotesAt December 31, 2011, we had $2,362 million of outstanding notes, compared to $2,371 million at December 31, 2010. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.45Table of Contents$1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013Our $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under this facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the parent company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors that are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $1.5 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2011, our borrowing base was above the facilitys stated amount of $1.5 billion.At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding and $407 million and $474 million, respectively, of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility.$1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, this facility was fully drawn.400 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2016Our amended and restated 400 million revolving credit facility consists of a 100 million German tranche that is available only to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Germany GmbH (the German borrower) and a 300 million all borrower tranche that is available to GDTE, the German borrower and certain of GDTEs other subsidiaries. Up to 50 million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the all borrower tranche. GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany provide guarantees to support the facility. GDTEs obligations under the facility and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by security interests in a variety of collateral. Goodyear and its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. senior secured credit facilities also provide unsecured guarantees to support the facility.As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no borrowings under the European revolving credit facility. Letters of credit issued under the all borrower tranche totaled $8 million (6 million) as of December 31, 2011 and $12 million (9 million) as of December 31, 2010.Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our financial condition since December 31, 2006 under the first lien facility and December 31, 2010 under the European facility. Each of the facilities described above have customary defaults, including cross defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and our subsidiaries. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to Covenant Compliance below and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet)GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a pan European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides up to 450 million of funding and expires in 2015. Utilization under this facility is based on current available receivable balances. The facility is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity commitments.The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount available and fully utilized under this program totaled $393 million (303 million) and $319 million (238 million), respectively. The program did not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in Long term debt and capital leases.In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have an accounts receivable securitization program totaling $75 million and $72 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 46Table of ContentsThe receivables sold under this program also serve as collateral for the related facility. We retain the risk of loss related to these receivables in the event of non payment. These amounts are included in Notes payable and overdrafts.Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet)Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2011 and 2010. For these programs, we have concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the gross amount of receivables sold was $190 million and $126 million, respectively.Other Foreign Credit FacilitiesOur Chinese subsidiary has two financing agreements in China. At December 31, 2011, these non revolving credit facilities had total unused availability of 1.2 billion renminbi ($188 million) and can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in China. The facilities contain covenants relating to our Chinese subsidiary and have customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to our Chinese subsidiarys ability to perform its obligations under the facilities. One of the facilities (with 1.1 billion renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2011) matures in 2018 and principal amortization begins in 2015. There were $199 million and $99 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The other facility (with 0.1 billion renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2011) matures in 2019 and principal amortization begins in 2015. There were $190 million and $54 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Restricted cash of $9 million and $8 million was related to funds obtained under these credit facilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Covenant ComplianceOur amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, make certain restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.We have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows:We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company and Guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (Available Cash) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $150 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2011, our availability under this facility of $1,093 million, plus our Available Cash of $1,024 million, totaled $2.1 billion, which is in excess of $150 million.We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0.In addition, our amended and restated European revolving credit facility contains non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTEs ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.Our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures 47Table of Contentshave substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test.There are no known future changes to, or new covenants in, any of our existing debt obligations other than as described above. Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt.As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures.The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness, Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness and Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities.Potential Future FinancingsIn addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured.Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt.DividendsUnder our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied.So long as any of our mandatory convertible preferred stock is outstanding, no dividend, except a dividend payable in shares of our common stock, or other shares ranking junior to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, may be paid or declared or any distribution be made on shares of our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the then outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock payable on all dividend payment dates occurring on or prior to the date of such action have been declared and paid or sufficient funds have been set aside for that payment.Asset DispositionsThe restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions.48Table of ContentsCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIESContractual ObligationsThe following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2011: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2011(In millions)Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Beyond 2016Debt Obligations(1)$5,170 $398 $81 $1,241 $489 $952 $2,009Capital Lease Obligations(2)31 14 13 1 1 1 1Interest Payments(3)2,060 333 312 287 268 204 656Operating Leases(4)1,431 322 284 214 163 122 326Pension Benefits(5)3,002 600 613 763 563 463 NAOther Postretirement Benefits(6)425 54 49 46 44 41 191Workers Compensation(7)407 63 56 36 27 21 204Binding Commitments(8)4,432 2,590 727 525 511 44 35Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9)47 16 12 2 11 6 $17,005 $4,390 $2,147 $3,115 $2,077 $1,848 $3,428 (1)Debt obligations include Notes payable and overdrafts.(2)The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $51 million.(3)These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2011 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt.(4)Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $44 million, $38 million, $28 million, $21 million, $11 million and $21 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $163 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,268 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $971 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party.(5)The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2011. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for U.S. defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law, including the election of funding relief as allowed by the Pension Relief Act; and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our U.S. plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including:Projected Target Liability interest rate of 5.37% for 2012, 4.95% for 2013, 4.70% for 2014, 4.79% for 2015 and 4.91% for 2016, andplan asset returns of 8.5% for 2012 and beyond.Future contributions are also affected by other factors such as:future interest rate levels,the amount and timing of asset returns, andhow contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amount and timing of future contributions.(6)The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced 49Table of Contentsto reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.(7)The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $302 million.(8)Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2011.(9)These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2011. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters.Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table.In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above:The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the global alliance agreements between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements. SRIs exit rights, in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance.Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers production levels.We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAn off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has:made guarantees,retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets,undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, orundertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $105 million at December 31, 2011 and expire at various times through 2023. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.50Table of ContentsFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENTCertain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words estimate, expect, intend and project, as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10 K. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including:if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected;higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition;our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expense;we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline;deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets or third party financing when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business;our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner;if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected;our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results;we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health;any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations;our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results;we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales;we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims;our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded;we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity;we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results;the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of those interests;we may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems;if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; andwe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement.51Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Commodity Price RiskThe raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire.Interest Rate RiskWe continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing. At December 31, 2011, 43% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 4.36% compared to 41% at an average rate of 3.72% at December 31, 2010.The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31:(In millions)2011 2010Carrying amount liability$2,843 $2,691Fair value liability2,891 2,791Pro forma fair value liability2,993 2,893The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements, and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation.The following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31:(In millions)2011 2010Fair value asset (liability)$31 $9Pro forma decrease in fair value(117) (113)Contract maturities1/12 10/19 1/11 10/19The pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview in this Form 10 K.2010 Compared to 2009Latin American Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 1.6 million units, or 8.5%, from the 2009 period. Replacement tire volume increased 0.9 million units, or 6.7%, reflecting increased volume in both consumer and commercial businesses. OE volume increased 0.7 million units, or 12.3%, due primarily to an increase in our consumer business.Net sales in 2010 increased $344 million, or 19.0%, from the 2009 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $219 million and increased volume of $128 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $30 million which included $192 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte.Operating income in 2010 increased $29 million, or 9.6%, from the same period in 2009, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $188 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $84 million, and lower conversion costs of $24 million. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, higher SAG costs of $26 million, and lower profitability on intersegment transfers of $24 million. Higher SAG expenses included higher wages and benefits of $13 million and higher warehousing expenses of $11 million. Conversion costs included lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $41 million and savings from rationalization plans of $8 million. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating income by approximately $85 million as compared to 2009.Operating income in 2010 excluded a charge of $25 million related to a claim regarding the use of value added tax credits in prior periods, net gains on asset sales of $7 million, and net rationalization charges of $5 million. In addition, a $134 million foreign currency exchange loss in Venezuela also is excluded from operating income in 2010. Operating income in 2009 excluded net rationalization charges of $20 million and net gains on asset sales of $2 million. In addition, operating income excluded charges of $18 million in 2009 resulting from the recognition of accumulated foreign currency translation losses in connection with the liquidation of our subsidiary in Guatemala. 36Table of ContentsAsia Pacific Tire Year Ended December 31,(In millions)2011 2010 2009Tire Units20.5 21.4 19.2Net Sales$2,396 $2,062 $1,709Operating Income234 250 210Operating Margin9.8% 12.1% 12.3%2011 Compared to 2010 Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2011 decreased 0.9 million units, or 4.2%, from the 2010 period. OE volume decreased by 0.6 million units, or 6.5%, primarily in the consumer business and replacement volume decreased by 0.3 million units, or 2.6%. Decreases in OE unit sales were primarily caused by supply disruptions at OE manufacturers as a result of the natural disaster in Japan as well as flooding in Thailand. Declines in replacement unit sales in Australia and New Zealand, which were affected by a continued weak retail environment, and in Thailand, which was impacted by flooding, more than offset increased replacement unit sales in China and India. Net sales in 2011 were $2,396 million, increasing $334 million, or 16.2%, from $2,062 million in the 2010 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $258 million and foreign currency translation of $147 million, primarily in Australia and China, which more than offset the impact of lower volume of $64 million.Operating income in 2011 was $234 million, decreasing $16 million, or 6.4%, from $250 million in 2010, due primarily to an increase in start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China of approximately $40 million, higher conversion costs of $13 million, lower volume of $12 million, higher SAG costs of $15 million and higher transportation costs of $6 million. These impacts were partially offset by improved price and product mix of $277 million, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $216 million, and favorable foreign currency translation of $17 million. The flooding of our factory in Thailand in the fourth quarter of 2011 reduced volume and increased conversion costs, which negatively impacted operating income by approximately $12 million.Operating income in 2011 and 2010 excluded net rationalization charges of $16 million and $11 million, respectively, and charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $7 million and $12 million, respectively. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $9 million in 2011, due primarily to the sale of land in Malaysia, and $58 million in 2010, due primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand. Asia Pacific Tires results are highly dependent upon Australia, which accounted for approximately 44% and 43% of Asia Pacific Tires net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accordingly, results of operations in Australia will have a significant impact on Asia Pacific Tires future performance. In 2012, start up expenses at our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China and under absorbed overhead costs at our Dalian, China manufacturing facility that is expected to be closed in the second half of 2012 are anticipated to adversely impact Asia Pacific Tires operating income by $40 million to $60 million compared to 2011. Following severe flooding in Thailand, we closed our consumer and aviation tire manufacturing facility in Bangkok in October 2011. The floodwaters that idled the plant receded in late November 2011, allowing us to make an assessment of the damage. In addition to the approximate $12 million impact on segment operating income, we recorded charges of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2011 in Other Expense, representing our deductible under an insurance policy. In the aggregate, our fourth quarter results of operations were negatively affected by approximately $21 million ($16 million after tax, or $0.07 per share). Restoration of our facility has commenced and we expect to resume production of aviation and consumer tires during the first quarter, ramping up to full production during the second quarter. As a result, we expect our first half of 2012 production and sales to be adversely affected. Over time, we do not expect the impact on our results of operations to be material due to available insurance coverage; however, the timing of recognition of insurance recoveries may lag the recording of incurred losses.37Table of Contents2010 Compared to 2009Asia Pacific Tire unit sales in 2010 increased 2.2 million units, or 11.6%, from the 2009 period. OE volumes increased 1.6 million units, or 22.5%, primarily in the consumer business, and replacement unit sales increased 0.6 million units, or 5.2%. The increase in units was due to growth in vehicle production in China and India.Net sales in 2010 increased $353 million, or 20.7%, compared to the 2009 period, due primarily to foreign currency translation of $172 million, increased volume of $158 million and improved price and product mix of $23 million.Operating income in 2010 increased $40 million, or 19.0%, compared to the 2009 period, due primarily to improved price and product mix of $110 million, which offset higher raw material costs of $106 million, increased volume of $32 million, favorable foreign currency translation of $21 million and decreased conversion costs of $19 million. Conversion costs included savings from rationalization plans of $16 million and lower under absorbed fixed overhead costs of $10 million. Operating income was adversely affected by start up expenses for our new manufacturing facility in Pulandian, China of approximately $10 million and higher SAG costs of $22 million, including increased wages and benefits of $9 million. Operating income in 2009 included a gain of $7 million from insurance proceeds related to the settlement of a claim as a result of a fire at our manufacturing facility in Thailand in 2007.Operating income in 2010 and 2009 excluded charges for accelerated depreciation and asset write offs of $12 million and $26 million, respectively, and net rationalization charges of $11 million and $10 million, respectively. In addition, operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of $58 million and $5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in Taiwan and land in Thailand in 2010.38Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods. Our critical accounting policies relate to:general and product liability and other litigation,workers compensation,recoverability of goodwill,deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions, andpensions and other postretirement benefits.General and Product Liability and Other Litigation. General and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on managements assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable. If the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the amount of the estimated loss. If the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another, we record the minimum amount in the range. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel. Court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss, which may have an impact on our reported results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer. Specifically, we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities. Typically, these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in Federal and state courts.A significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulties in making these estimates, analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated, and that increase may be significant. We had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims, inclusive of defense costs, totaling $138 million at December 31, 2011. The portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was $64 million. At December 31, 2011, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities, net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries, could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately $10 million.We maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements, and also have excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities. We record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery. This determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers, the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors.As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of $67 million, and we expect that approximately 50% of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability. Of this amount, $8 million was included in Current Assets as part of Accounts receivable at December 31, 2011. The recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers. Workers Compensation. We had recorded liabilities, on a discounted basis, of $302 million for anticipated costs related to U.S. workers compensation claims at December 31, 2011. The costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims, historical experience and current cost trends. The amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates. We periodically, and at least annually, update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses. The liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return.For further information on general and product liability and other litigation, and workers compensation, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.39Table of ContentsRecoverability of Goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. Goodwill totaled $654 million at December 31, 2011.We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units: North American Tire, Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire, Latin American Tire and Asia Pacific Tire. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units. There have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in 2011.FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2011 08 Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topics was issued in September 2011 and allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and if a quantitative assessment should be performed. We adopted this standard update in the third quarter in connection with our July 31, 2011 annual impairment assessment and performed a qualitative analysis. After considering changes to assumptions used in the prior year test, including the capital markets environment, global economic conditions, tire industry competition and trends, and improvements in our results of operations, as well as the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our 2010 annual testing of 40% for North American Tire, over 45% for EMEA and over 20% for Asia Pacific Tire, and other factors, we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was not less than its carrying value and, therefore, did not perform a quantitative analysis. Accordingly, the annual impairment test at July 31, 2011 indicated there was no impairment of goodwill. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Income Tax Positions. At December 31, 2011, we had valuation allowances aggregating $3.1 billion against all of our net Federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets.We assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three year period, is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. Our losses in the U.S. and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net Federal, state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities. We derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods, or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes. For additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 6, Income Taxes.Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions, including:life expectancies,retirement rates,discount rates,long term rates of return on plan assets,inflation rates,future compensation levels,future health care costs, andmaximum company covered benefit costs.Certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries. Assumptions about life expectancies, retirement rates, future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends. The discount rate for our U.S. plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated Aa 40Table of Contentsor higher as of December 31 and is reviewed annually. Our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve. The long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our U.S. pension fund over a period of 15 years or more, estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation. Actual U.S. pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis. These assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate. Changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. If the actual experience differs from expectations, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected.The weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.52% and 4.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2011, compared to 5.20% and 4.62% for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2011 was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds. Interest cost included in our U.S. net periodic pension cost was $283 million in 2011, compared to $296 million in 2010 and $314 million in 2009. Interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was $30 million in 2011, compared to $33 million in 2010 and $32 million in 2009. The following table presents the sensitivity of our U.S. projected pension benefit obligation, accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation, shareholders equity, and 2012 expense to the indicated increase/decrease in key assumptions: + / Change at December 31, 2011(Dollars in millions)Change PBO/ABO Equity 2012 ExpensePensions: Assumption: Discount rate+/ 0.5% $337 $337 $12Actual 2011 return on assets+/ 1.0% N/A 36 6Expected return on assets+/ 1.0% N/A N/A 35Other Postretirement Benefits: Assumption: Discount rate+/ 0.5% $11 $11 $Health care cost trends total cost+/ 1.0% 3 3 A significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $2,900 million in our U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2011 is a result of plan asset losses and the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. For purposes of determining our 2011 U.S. net periodic pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $134 million of the net actuarial loss in 2011. We will recognize approximately $183 million of net actuarial losses in 2012. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2011, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2012 before it begins to gradually decline.The actual rate of return on our U.S. pension fund was 0.7%, 14.4% and 25.6% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as compared to the expected rate of 8.50% for all three years. We use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our U.S. pension plans.We experienced a decrease in our U.S. discount rate at the end of 2011 and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in AOCL of $185 million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2011 is a result of the overall decline in U.S. discount rates over time. The net actuarial loss increased from 2010 due to the decrease in the discount rate at December 31, 2011. For purposes of determining 2011 worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost, we recognized $10 million of the net actuarial losses in 2011. We will recognize approximately $12 million of net actuarial losses in 2012. If our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of December 31, 2011, actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2012 before it begins to gradually decline.The weighted average amortization period for our U.S. plans is approximately 14 years.For further information on pensions and other postretirement benefits, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 17, Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits and Savings Plans.41Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOVERVIEWOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. We experienced uneven industry conditions in 2011 as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in Europe and the United States and continued high levels of unemployment, which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions. In emerging markets, high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions. In 2011, we took several actions to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity, including the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, the redemption of a portion of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016 with the proceeds of that equity offering, the refinancing of our European revolving credit facility and the issuance of euro denominated notes by GDTE. At December 31, 2011, we had solid liquidity, with approximately $5.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and unused availability under our credit facilities.For further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in 2011, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview.At December 31, 2011, we had $2,772 million in Cash and cash equivalents, compared to $2,005 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $773 million. Net income of $417 million and non cash depreciation and amortization of $715 million were partially offset by working capital expenditures of $650 million. Higher raw material costs and increased selling prices drove the increase in working capital, while higher inventory units to support customer service levels and weaker industry sales in the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, also contributed. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used by investing activities was $902 million and net cash provided by financing activities was $994 million. Cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock of $484 million and the issuance of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due 2019. Partially offsetting these increases in Cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of $1,043 million and the redemption of $350 million of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $2,544 million and $2,475 million, respectively, of unused availability under our various credit agreements. The table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of December 31:(In millions)2011 2010First lien revolving credit facility$1,093 $1,001European revolving credit facility511 664Chinese credit facilities188 394Other domestic and international debt410 158Notes payable and overdrafts342 258 $2,544 $2,475At December 31, 2011, our unused availability included $188 million that can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in China. These credit facilities, along with government grants, should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility. There were $389 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2011.We have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions. We seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits, credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions, by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads, and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis. We also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible. By controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner, we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution. Our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs.42Table of ContentsIn 2012, we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately $550 million to $600 million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. We also expect interest expense to range between $360 million and $385 million and, when and if future dividends are declared, dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock to be $29 million. We intend to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations. The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (the Pension Relief Act) provides funding relief for defined benefit pension plan sponsors by deferring near term contributions. As allowed by the Pension Relief Act, we elected funding relief for the 2009 and 2011 plan years. Funding relief delays certain funding requirements for the elected plan years to years after 2014 and is expected to reduce our total U.S. pension contributions in 2011 to 2014 by approximately $275 million to $325 million. Current low interest rates have increased our funding requirements, thereby offsetting much of the benefit provided by funding relief. We currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded U.S. pension plans of approximately $425 million to $450 million in 2012 and $425 million to $475 million in 2013. If the current low interest rate environment continues without funding stabilization legislation, we will experience additional increases in our funding obligations in 2014. For additional information, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. SRI has certain minority exit rights that, if triggered and exercised, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance. As of the date of this filing, SRI has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable.Our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent, in part, on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. In certain countries where we operate, such as China, Venezuela, and South Africa, transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends, loans, advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements, such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country. In addition, certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash. Thus, we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt. Because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations, we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries, including our Chinese, Venezuelan and South African subsidiaries, that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements. At December 31, 2011, approximately $647 million of net assets, including $534 million of cash and cash equivalents, were subject to such requirements, including $291 million of cash in Venezuela. The requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of China and South Africa have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries. Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuelas economy was considered to be highly inflationary under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of 100% over the latest three year period, based upon the blended Consumer Price Index and National Consumer Price Index. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary. All gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since January 1, 2010 were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in Other Expense. Venezuela remained a highly inflationary economy for U.S. GAAP purposes during 2011.On January 8, 2010, Venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods. For essential goods the official exchange rate was 2.6 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. On January 1, 2011, the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated. For our unsettled amounts at December 31, 2010 and going forward, the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar is expected to be used for substantially all goods.43Table of ContentsThe $110 million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of 2010 primarily consisted of a $157 million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, at the time of the January 2010 devaluation. The loss was primarily related to cash deposits in Venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods, and was partially offset by a $47 million subsidy receivable related to U.S. dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of 2.6 bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods. Since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate, we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates. Throughout 2010, we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable, and a substantial portion of purchases by our Venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods. As a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at December 31, 2010. If in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the Statement of Operations. At December 31, 2011, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $317 million, which consisted primarily of $291 million of cash, $18 million of deferred tax assets and $8 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $152 million which consisted primarily of $92 million of intercompany payables, including $59 million of dividends, $24 million of accounts payable trade, $15 million of compensation and benefits and $14 million of income taxes payable. At December 31, 2010, we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of $210 million, which consisted primarily of $188 million of cash, $18 million of deferred tax assets and $4 million of accounts receivable, and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of $75 million which consisted primarily of $48 million of intercompany payables, including $31 million of dividends, $12 million of accounts payable trade and $7 million of compensation and benefits. All monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 and 2010.Goodyear Venezuelas sales were 1.5% and 1.2% of our net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Goodyear Venezuelas cost of goods sold was 1.2% and 0.9% of our cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Goodyear Venezuelas sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately 55% bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately 45% U.S. dollar denominated. A further 10% decrease in the bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar would decrease Goodyear Venezuelas sales and increase cost of goods sold by approximately $39 million and approximately $26 million, respectively, on an annual basis.During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, Goodyear Venezuela settled $91 million and $12 million, respectively, of U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 92% of those payables were settled at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar and 8% were settled at the essential goods rate of 2.6 bolivar fuertes to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2011, settlements of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were $159 million, all of which are expected to settle at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivares fuertes to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2011, $81 million of the requested settlements were pending up to 180 days, less than $1 million were pending from 180 to 360 days and $78 million were pending over one year. Amounts pending up to 180 days include imported tires and raw materials of $43 million and dividends payable of $28 million, and amounts pending over one year include dividends payable of $31 million, imported tires of $17 million and intercompany charges for royalties of $17 million. Currency exchange controls in Venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from Venezuela.Goodyear Venezuela contributed a significant portion of Latin American Tires sales and operating income in 2011 and 2010. The devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the U.S. dollar in January 2010 and weak economic conditions and operational disruptions in Venezuela adversely impacted Latin American Tires operating income in 2010. We continue to face operational challenges in Venezuela, including inflationary cost pressures, high absenteeism, and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods. In response to conditions in Venezuela, we continue to evaluate the need to adjust prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges, including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires. Our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material and other production costs, market demand and adherence to government price controls. For a discussion of the risks related to our international operations, including Venezuela, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in 2012 and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment. If market opportunities exist, we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position, which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions. However, the challenges we face may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more detailed discussion of these challenges.44Table of ContentsCash PositionAt December 31, 2011, significant concentrations of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries included the following amounts:$793 million or 29% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, primarily Luxembourg and South Africa ($415 million or 21% at December 31, 2010),$430 million or 16% in Asia, primarily China, Australia and India ($393 million or 20% at December 31, 2010), and$527 million or 19% in Latin America, primarily Venezuela and Brazil ($368 million or 18% at December 31, 2010).Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operations was $773 million in 2011, compared to $924 million in 2010 and $1,297 million in 2009. Operating cash flows in 2011 were favorably impacted by the improvement in earnings compared to 2010. Net cash used by working capital was $650 million in 2011, compared to net cash provided of $52 million and $1,081 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash used for working capital in 2011 was due primarily to higher raw material costs and increased selling prices, while higher inventory units to support customer service levels and weaker industry sales in the fourth quarter, primarily in EMEA, also contributed.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $902 million in 2011, compared to $859 million in 2010 and $663 million in 2009. Capital expenditures were $1,043 million in 2011, compared to $944 million in 2010 and $746 million in 2009. Capital expenditures in 2011 increased from 2010 due primarily to the expansion of manufacturing capacity in China and Chile. Capital expenditures in 2010 and 2009 primarily related to projects targeted at increasing our capacity for high value added tires, which were scaled back in 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions. Investing cash flows in 2011 included cash inflows of $95 million from government grants related to the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in China. Investing cash flows also reflect cash provided from the disposition of assets each year as a result of the realignment of operations under rationalization programs and the divestiture of non core assets.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $994 million in 2011, compared to $179 million in 2010 and net cash used of $654 million in 2009. Financing activities in 2011 included $484 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of $562 million to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures. Included in these net borrowings were the issuance by GDTE of 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due 2019 and the redemption of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 10.5% senior notes due 2016.Credit SourcesIn aggregate, we had total credit arrangements of $8,129 million available at December 31, 2011, of which $2,544 million were unused, compared to $7,689 million available at December 31, 2010, of which $2,475 million were unused. At December 31, 2011, we had long term credit arrangements totaling $7,531 million, of which $2,202 million were unused, compared to $7,193 million and $2,217 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had short term committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $598 million, of which $342 million were unused, compared to $496 million and $258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The continued availability of the short term uncommitted arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender and may be terminated at any time.See the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments for a discussion of the redemption of a portion of our 10.5% senior notes due 2016, the amendment and restatement of our European revolving credit facility and the issuance of 250 million of GDTE 6.75% senior notes due 2019. See the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 20, Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for a discussion of the issuance of our 5.875% mandatory convertible preferred stock.Outstanding NotesAt December 31, 2011, we had $2,362 million of outstanding notes, compared to $2,371 million at December 31, 2010. For additional information on our outstanding notes, refer to the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements, No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.45Table of Contents$1.5 Billion Amended and Restated First Lien Revolving Credit Facility due 2013Our $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility is available in the form of loans or letters of credit, with letter of credit availability limited to $800 million. Subject to the consent of the lenders whose commitments are to be increased, we may request that the facility be increased by up to $250 million. Our obligations under the facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. Our obligations under this facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in various collateral. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the parent company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries, after adjusting for customary factors that are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders at their discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Modifications are based on the results of periodic collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under the facility may decrease below $1.5 billion. In addition, if the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess. As of December 31, 2011, our borrowing base was above the facilitys stated amount of $1.5 billion.At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding and $407 million and $474 million, respectively, of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility.$1.2 Billion Amended and Restated Second Lien Term Loan Facility due 2014Our obligations under this facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by second priority security interests in the same collateral securing the $1.5 billion first lien revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, this facility was fully drawn.400 Million Amended and Restated Senior Secured European Revolving Credit Facility due 2016Our amended and restated 400 million revolving credit facility consists of a 100 million German tranche that is available only to Goodyear Dunlop Tires Germany GmbH (the German borrower) and a 300 million all borrower tranche that is available to GDTE, the German borrower and certain of GDTEs other subsidiaries. Up to 50 million in letters of credit are available for issuance under the all borrower tranche. GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France and Germany provide guarantees to support the facility. GDTEs obligations under the facility and the obligations of its subsidiaries under the related guarantees are secured by security interests in a variety of collateral. Goodyear and its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries that guarantee our U.S. senior secured credit facilities also provide unsecured guarantees to support the facility.As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no borrowings under the European revolving credit facility. Letters of credit issued under the all borrower tranche totaled $8 million (6 million) as of December 31, 2011 and $12 million (9 million) as of December 31, 2010.Each of our first lien revolving credit facility and our European revolving credit facility have customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct, in all material respects, on the date of the borrowing, including representations as to no material adverse change in our financial condition since December 31, 2006 under the first lien facility and December 31, 2010 under the European facility. Each of the facilities described above have customary defaults, including cross defaults to material indebtedness of Goodyear and our subsidiaries. For a description of the collateral securing the above facilities as well as the covenants applicable to them, please refer to Covenant Compliance below and the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.International Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities (On Balance Sheet)GDTE and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a pan European accounts receivable securitization facility that provides up to 450 million of funding and expires in 2015. Utilization under this facility is based on current available receivable balances. The facility is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity commitments.The facility involves an ongoing daily sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain GDTE subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote French company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility. These subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount available and fully utilized under this program totaled $393 million (303 million) and $319 million (238 million), respectively. The program did not qualify for sale accounting, and accordingly, these amounts are included in Long term debt and capital leases.In addition to the pan European accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above, subsidiaries in Australia have an accounts receivable securitization program totaling $75 million and $72 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 46Table of ContentsThe receivables sold under this program also serve as collateral for the related facility. We retain the risk of loss related to these receivables in the event of non payment. These amounts are included in Notes payable and overdrafts.Accounts Receivable Factoring Facilities (Off Balance Sheet)Various subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during 2011 and 2010. For these programs, we have concluded that there is generally no risk of loss to us from non payment of the sold receivables. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the gross amount of receivables sold was $190 million and $126 million, respectively.Other Foreign Credit FacilitiesOur Chinese subsidiary has two financing agreements in China. At December 31, 2011, these non revolving credit facilities had total unused availability of 1.2 billion renminbi ($188 million) and can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in China. The facilities contain covenants relating to our Chinese subsidiary and have customary representations and warranties and defaults relating to our Chinese subsidiarys ability to perform its obligations under the facilities. One of the facilities (with 1.1 billion renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2011) matures in 2018 and principal amortization begins in 2015. There were $199 million and $99 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The other facility (with 0.1 billion renminbi of unused availability at December 31, 2011) matures in 2019 and principal amortization begins in 2015. There were $190 million and $54 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Restricted cash of $9 million and $8 million was related to funds obtained under these credit facilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Covenant ComplianceOur amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock, make certain restricted payments or investments, incur liens, sell assets, incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, enter into affiliate transactions, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.We have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable. We only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur. These financial covenants and related events are as follows:We become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our Parent Company and Guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents (Available Cash) plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than $150 million. If this were to occur, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2011, our availability under this facility of $1,093 million, plus our Available Cash of $1,024 million, totaled $2.1 billion, which is in excess of $150 million.We become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales. The covenant provides that, before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien, senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA (Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than 3.0 to 1.0.In addition, our amended and restated European revolving credit facility contains non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to GDTE and its subsidiaries. This financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow GDTEs ratio of Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness to Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held by GDTE and its subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents in excess of $150 million held by the Parent Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met. Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated Goodyear entities. This financial covenant is also included in our pan European accounts receivable securitization facility. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.Our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if, after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment, our ratio of EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed 2.0 to 1.0. Certain of our senior note indentures 47Table of Contentshave substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments. Our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above. We believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating, investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test.There are no known future changes to, or new covenants in, any of our existing debt obligations other than as described above. Covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility, or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt.As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures.The terms Available Cash, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Secured Indebtedness, Pro Forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net J.V. Indebtedness and Consolidated European J.V. EBITDA have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities.Potential Future FinancingsIn addition to our previous financing activities, we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions, possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity. Given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions, access to the capital markets cannot be assured.Our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. However, a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness. In addition, no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt.DividendsUnder our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing, additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment, and certain financial tests are satisfied.So long as any of our mandatory convertible preferred stock is outstanding, no dividend, except a dividend payable in shares of our common stock, or other shares ranking junior to the mandatory convertible preferred stock, may be paid or declared or any distribution be made on shares of our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the then outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock payable on all dividend payment dates occurring on or prior to the date of such action have been declared and paid or sufficient funds have been set aside for that payment.Asset DispositionsThe restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses, and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions.48Table of ContentsCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIESContractual ObligationsThe following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2011: Payment Due by Period as of December 31, 2011(In millions)Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Beyond 2016Debt Obligations(1)$5,170 $398 $81 $1,241 $489 $952 $2,009Capital Lease Obligations(2)31 14 13 1 1 1 1Interest Payments(3)2,060 333 312 287 268 204 656Operating Leases(4)1,431 322 284 214 163 122 326Pension Benefits(5)3,002 600 613 763 563 463 NAOther Postretirement Benefits(6)425 54 49 46 44 41 191Workers Compensation(7)407 63 56 36 27 21 204Binding Commitments(8)4,432 2,590 727 525 511 44 35Uncertain Income Tax Positions(9)47 16 12 2 11 6 $17,005 $4,390 $2,147 $3,115 $2,077 $1,848 $3,428 (1)Debt obligations include Notes payable and overdrafts.(2)The minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations are $51 million.(3)These amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations and capital leases based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt and lease agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt are based on the six month LIBOR rate at December 31, 2011 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented. The amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt.(4)Operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $44 million, $38 million, $28 million, $21 million, $11 million and $21 million in each of the periods above, respectively, for a total of $163 million. Payments, net of minimum sublease rentals, total $1,268 million. The present value of the net operating lease payments is $971 million. The operating leases relate to, among other things, real estate, vehicles, data processing equipment and miscellaneous other assets. No asset is leased from any related party.(5)The obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of December 31, 2011. Although subject to change, the amounts set forth in the table represent the midpoint of the range of our estimated minimum funding requirements for U.S. defined benefit pension plans under current ERISA law, including the election of funding relief as allowed by the Pension Relief Act; and the midpoint of the range of our expected contributions to our funded non U.S. pension plans, plus expected cash funding of direct participant payments to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans. The expected contributions for our U.S. plans are based upon a number of assumptions, including:Projected Target Liability interest rate of 5.37% for 2012, 4.95% for 2013, 4.70% for 2014, 4.79% for 2015 and 4.91% for 2016, andplan asset returns of 8.5% for 2012 and beyond.Future contributions are also affected by other factors such as:future interest rate levels,the amount and timing of asset returns, andhow contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amount and timing of future contributions.(6)The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. Under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans. The obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced 49Table of Contentsto reflect the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.(7)The payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims. The present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is $302 million.(8)Binding commitments are for raw materials, capital expenditures, utilities, and various other types of contracts. The obligations to purchase raw materials include supply contracts at both fixed and variable prices. Those with variable prices are based on index rates for those commodities at December 31, 2011.(9)These amounts primarily represent expected payments with interest for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2011. We have reflected them in the period in which we believe they will be ultimately settled based upon our experience with these matters.Additional other long term liabilities include items such as general and product liabilities, environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities. These other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled. Accordingly, these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table.In addition, the following contingent contractual obligations, the amounts of which cannot be estimated, are not included in the table above:The terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI, as set forth in the global alliance agreements between SRI and us, provide for certain minority exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the global alliance agreements, including certain bankruptcy events, changes in our control or breaches of the global alliance agreements. SRIs exit rights, in the event of the occurrence of a triggering event and the subsequent exercise of SRIs exit rights, could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of SRIs interests. For further information regarding our global alliance with SRI, including the events that could trigger SRIs exit rights, see Item 1. Business. Description of Goodyears Business Global Alliance.Pursuant to certain long term agreements, we will purchase varying amounts of certain raw materials and finished goods at agreed upon base prices that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in raw material costs and market price adjustments, or in quantities that may be subject to periodic adjustments for changes in our or our suppliers production levels.We do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts. We generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term, intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices. We may, however, from time to time, enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAn off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has:made guarantees,retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets,undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments, orundertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.We have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees that are off balance sheet arrangements. Those guarantees totaled approximately $105 million at December 31, 2011 and expire at various times through 2023. For further information about our guarantees, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.50Table of ContentsFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SAFE HARBOR STATEMENTCertain information in this Form 10 K (other than historical data and information) may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position. The words estimate, expect, intend and project, as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning, are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10 K. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, are inherently uncertain, are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution. Actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including:if we do not achieve projected savings from various cost reduction initiatives or successfully implement other strategic initiatives our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected;higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition;our pension plans are significantly underfunded and further increases in the underfunded status of the plans could significantly increase the amount of our required contributions and pension expense;we face significant global competition, increasingly from lower cost manufacturers, and our market share could decline;deteriorating economic conditions in any of our major markets, or an inability to access capital markets or third party financing when necessary, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;work stoppages, financial difficulties or supply disruptions at our major OE customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business;our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner;if we experience a labor strike, work stoppage or other similar event our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected;our long term ability to meet current obligations and to repay maturing indebtedness is dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results;we have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health;any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our secured credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our results of operations;our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results;we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity;our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;we have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales;we may incur significant costs in connection with product liability and other tort claims;our reserves for product liability and other tort claims and our recorded insurance assets are subject to various uncertainties, the outcome of which may result in our actual costs being significantly higher than the amounts recorded;we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity;we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results;the terms and conditions of our global alliance with SRI provide for certain exit rights available to SRI upon the occurrence of certain events, which could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire SRIs minority interests in GDTE and GDTNA following the determination of the fair value of those interests;we may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems;if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected; andwe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. We will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts, events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement.51Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks. We have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Commodity Price RiskThe raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities. Approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives, the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil. We currently do not hedge commodity prices. We do, however, use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials, including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power, expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire.Interest Rate RiskWe continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix. Within defined limitations, we manage the mix using refinancing. At December 31, 2011, 43% of our debt was at variable interest rates averaging 4.36% compared to 41% at an average rate of 3.72% at December 31, 2010.The following table presents information about long term fixed rate debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31:(In millions)2011 2010Carrying amount liability$2,843 $2,691Fair value liability2,891 2,791Pro forma fair value liability2,993 2,893The pro forma information assumes a 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows. These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables, equipment acquisitions, intercompany loans and royalty agreements, and forecasted purchases and sales. Contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation.The following table presents foreign currency derivative information at December 31:(In millions)2011 2010Fair value asset (liability)$31 $9Pro forma decrease in fair value(117) (113)Contract maturities1/12 10/19 1/11 10/19The pro forma decrease in fair value assumes a 10% adverse change in underlying foreign exchange rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the estimated change in the fair value of positions outstanding at that date under that assumption. The sensitivity of our foreign currency positions to changes in exchange rates was determined using current market pricing models.52Table of ContentsFair values are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows:(In millions)2011 2010Asset (liability): Accounts receivable$37 $25Other Assets 1Other current liabilities(5) (17)Other long term liabilities(1) For further information on foreign currency contracts, refer to the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 15, Financing Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of our management of counterparty risk.53Table of Contents
