Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Years Ended December 31, Items in Consolidated Statements Percent of Increase of Earnings as a Percent of (Decrease) from Net Sales Prior Year 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 Net sales............................................ 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% (4.5)% 7.4% Cost of merchandise sold............................. 66.6 68.2 67.4 (6.7) 8.5 Operating expenses................................... 26.3 25.1 25.8 0.0 4.8 Operating earnings................................... 7.1 6.7 6.8 1.0 5.6 Other deductions, net................................ 0.8 0.0 0.3 1,071.4 (73.8) Income taxes......................................... 2.6 2.8 2.6 (11.5) 12.7 Net earnings......................................... 3.7% 3.9% 3.9% (9.5)% 6.7% 8 Company Net Sales 2001 Compared to 2000 The Companys net sales of $4,754,317,000 for 2001 decreased 4.5% from net sales of $4,977,044,000 for 2000. This decrease resulted from a 5.2% decrease in the Branch based Distribution Businesses segment, a 46.2% decrease in the Digital Businesses segment, and a 1.6% decrease at Lab Safety Supply, partially offset by a 5.5% increase in the Other Businesses of the Company. The year 2001 had the same number of sales days as 2000 (255). Sales performance was affected by the general weakness in the North American economy and worsened by quarter throughout the year. Segment Net Sales The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales. For segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch based Distribution Businesses Net sales at the Branch based Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,251,596,000 in 2001, a 5.2% decrease as compared with 2000 sales of $4,483,777,000. Sales in the United States decreased in 2001 as compared with 2000 primarily due to the recession in the United States. Also contributing to the decline was a decrease in the sales of seasonal products due to relatively mild weather in the summer and winter seasons. Sales to government accounts increased while other categories declined. Sales were favorably affected by continued momentum in the Companys Internet strategy. For 2001, Grainger.com processed sales of approximately $333,000,000, a 24.7% increase from the $267,000,000 processed in 2000. In Canada, average daily sales decreased 2.8% in 2001 as compared with 2000. This decrease was driven primarily by an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, average daily sales increased 1.3% in 2001 as compared with 2000. The growth in Canada was driven primarily by an improvement in the oil and gas sector of the economy, partially offset by the impact of the weakness in other sectors of the Canadian economy. The Companys Canadian operations also experienced a negative sales trend with sales declining in the second half of the year on a comparative basis with 2000. In Mexico, average daily sales decreased 17.0% in 2001 as compared with 2000. This sales performance reflects the weakness in the automotive and electronics manufacturing industries, deterioration of the Mexican economy, along with the impact of the recession in the United States. Digital Businesses Net sales at the Digital Businesses amounted to $29,979,000 in 2001, a 46.2% decrease as compared with 2000 sales of $55,683,000. Net sales for this segment represented product sales and service fee revenues for FindMRO and service fee revenues for the rest of Material Logic. On April 23, 2001, the Company announced that it would shut down the operations of Material Logic with the exception of FindMRO. In connection with this announcement, the Company took a pretax, non recurring charge of $39.1 million in 2001. FindMRO was then established as an operating unit separate from Material Logic. Effective June 1, 2001, FindMRO was added to the Branch based Distribution Businesses. Beginning with the 2001 third quarter, the Digital Businesses segment ceased operations. For additional information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Lab Safety Supply Net sales at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $324,797,000 in 2001, a 1.6% decrease compared with 2000 sales of $330,108,000. Lab Safety Supplys sales included the results of The Ben Meadows Co., an acquisition made in the 2001 first quarter. Excluding the sales of The Ben Meadows Co., 2001 sales would have been down 6.2% when compared with 2000, primarily the result of weak sales in the nations industrial sector. Other Businesses Net sales at the Other Businesses amounted to $190,811,000 in 2001, a 5.5% increase over 2000 sales of $180,852,000. Sales growth for this group of businesses was primarily related to a strong sales increase at Grainger Integrated Supply. Sales for this business unit included product sales and management fees. Company Net Sales 2000 Compared to 1999 The Companys net sales of $4,977,044,000 for 2000 increased 7.4% from net sales of $4,636,275,000 for 1999. This increase resulted from a 6.5% increase in the Branch based Distribution Businesses segment, a 1,769.2% increase in the Digital Businesses segment, a 5.3% increase at Lab Safety Supply, and a 43.7% increase in the Other Businesses of the Company. The year 2000 had one more sales day than did 1999 (255 versus 254). On a daily basis the Companys net sales increased 6.9%. 9 Sales growth for 2000 was primarily volume driven, reflecting growth in the Branch based Businesses, especially in Canada and Mexico; strong growth at Grainger Integrated Supply; and continued strong growth in sales processed through the Companys Internet sites. Sales processed through the Companys Internet businesses, as represented by the Digital segment plus Grainger.com, amounted to $337,000,000 in 2000, a 230% increase as compared with $102,000,000 for the year 1999. The Companys sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2000 was negatively affected by a slowing economy. Segment Net Sales The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales. For segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch based Distribution Businesses Net sales at the Branch based Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,483,777,000 in 2000, a 6.5% increase over 1999 sales of $4,211,316,000. Average daily sales increased by 6.1%. The Companys Canadian operations experienced double digit sales growth. The growth was the result of strong sales across most of Canada. The growth was driven by an improvement in the oil and gas, forestry, and mining sectors of the Canadian economy, gains in large customer accounts, and the opening of 10 new branches during 1999. The Companys Mexican operations experienced double digit sales growth reflecting the continued development of this business. This growth in sales was attributable to an expanded product offering and account penetration. In January 2000, the Company opened a second branch in Mexico. Sales growth in the United States was driven by improved sales at Grainger Industrial Supply. Contributing to the sales growth were 35 new branches opened during 1999 and 2000. Also contributing to the sales growth was increased sales to government accounts. Sales were also favorably affected by continued momentum in the Companys Internet initiative. Sales orders processed through Grainger.com amounted to $267,000,000 in 2000, a 164% increase over 1999 sales of $101,000,000. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of a 20% decline in third quarter sales of seasonal products resulting from relatively mild weather in the more heavily populated areas of the United States. Also, sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2000 was negatively affected by a slowing economy. Digital Businesses Net sales at the Digital Businesses amounted to $55,683,000 in 2000, a significant increase over 1999 sales of $2,979,000. Sales for this group of businesses include product sales and service fee revenues for FindMRO and service fee revenues for MROverstocks.com (formerly Grainger Auction) and TotalMRO.com. FindMRO and MROverstocks.com were officially launched in November 1999. TotalMRO.com opened for business on March 31, 2000. Lab Safety Supply Net sales at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $330,108,000, a 5.3% increase over 1999 sales of $313,533,000. This increase reflects the continued growth in sales of industrial products and expanded market share attained through new customers and further penetration of existing accounts. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in sales of safety products resulting from a slowing of the industrial economy in the United States. Other Businesses Net sales at the Other Businesses amounted to $180,852,000 in 2000, a 43.7% increase over 1999 sales of $125,882,000. Sales growth for this group of businesses was primarily related to a strong sales increase at Grainger Integrated Supply. Sales for this business unit include product sales and management fees. Growth was driven by new engagements, contract renewals, and scope expansions, reflecting increasing demand for this outsourcing business, which provides fee based, on site indirect materials management services to large businesses. Company Net Earnings 2001 Compared to 2000 The Companys net earnings of $174,530,000 for 2001 decreased 9.5% compared with 2000 net earnings of $192,903,000. The Companys earnings per share for the year declined 10.2% to $1.84 in 2001 from $2.05 in 2000. The results for 2001 included a non recurring, after tax charge of $36,650,000, or $0.39 per share. The results for 2000 included an after tax gain of $17,860,000, or $0.19 per share, related to sales of investment securities. Excluding these non recurring items from both periods, net earnings increased 20.6% to $211,180,000 in 2001 from $175,043,000 in 2000 and earnings per share increased 19.9% to $2.23 in 2001 from $1.86 in 2000. 10 Segment Operating Earnings The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment operating earnings; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment operating earnings. For segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch based Distribution Businesses Operating earnings of $386,331,000 declined 2.7% in 2001 as compared with $397,252,000 for 2000. Lower sales and an increase in operating expenses contributed to the decline in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. Operating expenses increased 1.9% in 2001 versus 2000. Operating expenses increased due to higher occupancy expenses, including the effect of start up costs relating to the opening of two new distribution centers, increased data processing expenses and increased employee benefits costs. These factors were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses and lower advertising expenses. The gross profit margin was affected by selected pricing actions in 2001 intended to cover freight and supplier cost increases, and lower sales of seasonal products. Historically, the sales of seasonal products have lower than average gross profit margins. Digital Businesses On April 23, 2001, the Company announced that it would shut down the operations of Material Logic with the exception of FindMRO. In connection with this announcement, the Company took a pretax, non recurring charge of $39,070,000 in 2001. FindMRO was then established as an operating unit separate from Material Logic. Effective June 1, 2001, FindMRO was added to the Branch based Distribution Businesses. Beginning with the 2001 third quarter, the Digital Businesses segment ceased operations. The Digital Businesses incurred operating losses of $49,227,000 in 2001 which included the non recurring charge of $39,070,000 mentioned above. This compares with operating losses of $48,207,000 in 2000. For additional information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Lab Safety Supply Operating earnings of $51,114,000 decreased 7.1% in 2001 as compared with $55,037,000 for 2000. The decrease in operating earnings was impacted by the decline in net sales and an increase in payroll and employee benefits costs, and increased data processing costs. Other Businesses The Other Businesses achieved operating income of $449,000 in 2001 compared with operating losses of $13,257,000 in 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results at Grainger Integrated Supply. These results were achieved by eliminating or renegotiating unprofitable contracts and by reducing its cost structure through improved productivity. Other Income Statement Data Other income or deductions included the following non recurring items: 1. In 2001, a $25,123,000 loss relating to investments in digital enterprises. 2. In 2000, a gain of $30,017,000 from the sale of investment securities. Excluding the non recurring items from both periods, the year 2001 had a net deduction of $16,170,000 versus a net deduction of $33,542,000 in the comparable 2000 period. The difference was primarily attributable to lower interest expense. The Companys effective tax rate was 41.3% and 41.8% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The rate decrease in 2001 as compared with 2000 was primarily due to the following two items, which lowered the effective tax rate for 2001 when compared with 2000: 1. Lower amounts of losses in unconsolidated entities; and 2. The tax impact of the write off of investments in unconsolidated entities, which had tax benefits disproportionate to the loss incurred. These items were partially offset by the tax impact of capital losses which are not deductible in the absence of capital gains. Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate was 40.5% for both 2001 and 2000. 11 Company Net Earnings 2000 Compared to 1999 The Companys net earnings of $192,903,000 for 2000 increased 6.7% as compared with 1999 net earnings of $180,731,000. This increase resulted from higher operating earnings and lower other deductions, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate. Operating earnings improved at the Branch based Distribution Businesses and at Lab Safety Supply. Also, the operating losses at the Other Businesses decreased. These improvements were partially offset by the increased operating losses at the Digital Businesses. Segment Operating Earnings The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment operating earnings; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment operating earnings. For segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch based Distribution Businesses Operating earnings at the Branch based Distribution Businesses amounted to $397,252,000 in 2000, an 11.0% increase over 1999 operating earnings of $357,925,000. This improvement in operating earnings was greater than the sales increase because operating expenses grew at a slower rate than the growth in sales, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Operating expenses increased 2%, primarily the result of productivity improvements. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher data processing expenses (including increased depreciation, amortization, and systems maintenance costs) and increased bad debt provisions. Gross profit margins decreased 0.67 percentage point as compared to 1999. Of note are the following factors affecting the gross profit margin: 1. Grainger Industrial Supplys gross profit margin declined. This decline was primarily due to an unfavorable change in selling price category mix resulting from increased sales of sourced products and to higher freight costs. The above factors were partially offset by selected price increases during the 2000 third quarter. The price increases were intended to recover freight and supplier cost increases. 2. Acklands Grainger Inc. had a lower gross profit margin primarily due to an unfavorable change in selling price category mix as a result of increased sales to large customers. Digital Businesses The Digital Businesses incurred operating losses of $48,207,000 in 2000 compared with operating losses of $20,560,000 in 1999. During 2000 the Company continued to invest in developing, enhancing, operating, and marketing these digital businesses. Total operating expenses associated with the Companys Internet initiatives, as represented by this segment plus Grainger.com (which is included in the Branch based Distribution Businesses segment), were $108,000,000 in 2000 as compared with $42,000,000 in 1999. On August 1, 2000, the Company combined OrderZone.com with Works.com, a leading Internet purchasing service. This combination was designed to provide small and mid size businesses with online purchasing services for indirect business products. The Company received a 40% interest in the combined entity and recognized a proportionate share of earnings or losses as part of Other Deductions. On January 26, 2001, the Company announced the consolidation of FindMRO, MROverstocks.com, and TotalMRO.com into a separate organization, Material Logic. Participation was sought from MRO distributors to establish Material Logic as an industry backed, industry funded independent entity that would own and operate these businesses. Material Logic was also expected to include related consulting, implementation, and content services. Lab Safety Supply Operating earnings at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $55,037,000 in 2000, a 28.4% increase over 1999 operating earnings of $42,878,000. This increase resulted from improved operating performance and the elimination of expenses related to certain fully amortized intangibles. Other Businesses The Other Businesses of the Company incurred operating losses of $13,257,000 in 2000 compared with operating losses of $16,306,000 in 1999. The lower operating losses for this group of companies was a function of improved performance at all of the businesses grouped under this caption, including Grainger Integrated Supply. 12 Other Income Statement Data Interest expense of $24,403,000 for 2000 increased by $8,807,000 as compared with 1999. This increase resulted from higher average borrowings, higher average interest rates paid on all outstanding debt, and lower capitalized interest. The equity in losses of unconsolidated entities (after tax) primarily related to the Companys interest in Works.com, which was acquired during the 2000 third quarter. Unclassified net income for 2000 was $29,842,000 versus $512,000 for 1999. The year 2000 included a $30,017,000 gain from the sales of investment securities. The Companys effective income tax rate was 41.8% for 2000 and 40.5% for 1999. The increase in the effective income tax rate relates to the loss on equity interest in unconsolidated entities, which is a net of tax number. Excluding the effect of these joint venture losses, the effective income tax rate was 40.5% for both years. FINANCIAL CONDITION Working capital was $838,800,000 at December 31, 2001, compared with $735,678,000 at December 31, 2000, and $600,611,000 at December 31, 1999. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.5, 2.0, and 1.7, at such dates. Net cash flows from operations of $510,794,000 in 2001, $277,757,000 in 2000, and $37,240,000 in 1999, have continued to improve the Companys financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements. For information as to the Companys cash flows, see Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In each of the past three years, a portion of working capital has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment, and capitalized software as summarized in the following table. 2001 2000 1999 (In thousands of dollars) Land, buildings, structures, and improvements .............. $ 26,534 $ 32,822 $ 41,104 Furniture, fixtures, machinery, and equipment .............. 73,917 32,685 70,796 100,451 65,507 111,900 Capitalized software ....................................... 6,717 29,406 26,473 Total ...................................................... $ 107,168 $ 94,913 $ 138,373 The Company repurchased 1,820,000 shares of its common stock during 2001, 31,400 shares of its common stock during 2000, and 355,300 shares of its common stock during 1999. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 3,500,000 shares of common stock remained available under the Companys repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $65,445,000 in 2001, $62,863,000 in 2000, and $58,817,000 in 1999. Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and funds needed for expanding the business, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition to continuing facilities optimization efforts, business development, and systems and other infrastructure enhancements, funds are being expended to enhance the Companys Internet initiatives. The Company maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provide flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, the Company has various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit and otherwise. Total debt as a percent of Shareholders Equity was 8%, 21%, and 30% at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last in, first out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the primary financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation. The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital turnover, and offering products and services which can command appropriate price levels in the marketplace. 13 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Throughout this Form 10 K are forward looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward looking statements relate to the Companys expected future financial results and business plans, strategies, and objectives and are not historical facts. They are often identified by qualifiers such as: will, intended, is transitioning, or similar expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause the Companys results to differ materially from what is projected. Factors that may affect forward looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on the Companys businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; changes in laws and regulations; facilities disruptions or shutdowns, natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance. Trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates, general economic conditions, including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, global and other conflicts, and other factors. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company partially hedges the net Canadian dollar investment of its Canadian subsidiary with borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this Canadian dollar denominated financing. For 2001, a uniform 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies in which the Companys sales are made would not have had a material effect on net income. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices. The Company also is exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio. All of the Companys long term debt at December 31, 2001, is variable rate debt. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the maturity schedule of the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2001. For 2001, a one percentage point increase in interest rates paid by the Company would result in a decrease in net income of approximately $0.9 million. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or long term debt levels. The Company is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly.
