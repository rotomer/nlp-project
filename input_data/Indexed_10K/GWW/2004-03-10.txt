Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General. Grainger is the leading broad line supplier of facilities maintenance products in North America. Grainger reports its operating results in three segments: Branch based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. Grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches, field sales forces, direct marketing including catalogs and a variety of electronic and Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through a network of 575 branches, 17 distribution centers and multiple Web sites. Business Environment. Several economic factors and industry trends shape Graingers business environment. The current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in the development of projections for the upcoming year. At the start of 2004, the Consensus Forecast USA is predicting GDP and Industrial Production growth of 4 to 5 percent for 2004. Graingers sales to manufacturers tend to correlate more with employment levels than with manufacturing output, so job creation, in addition to manufacturing production, is an indicator for potential sales growth. Most recently, declining employment in the manufacturing sector, due to increased productivity and production moving offshore, has adversely affected the operating results of Grainger. This trend is likely to continue, and could adversely affect employment levels in one of Graingers largest sectors. To address this trend, Grainger has been focusing on government and commercial customers and healthcare institutions. To reach more customer groups, Graingers market expansion program will increase branch coverage, expand local availability of products and add local sales professionals in high potential markets through a multi year program focused on local customers. The customers buying behavior also affects Graingers business environment. In 2004, Grainger will continue to target large, multi site customers including government and national accounts. Sales from government accounts grew from 13% of total sales in 2001 to 17% in 2003. Grainger believes that customers will increasingly focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products. Grainger is addressing this anticipated shift in focus by expanding its market coverage and increasing product information available to branch employees for improved service to local customers by accelerating replacement of its legacy information systems. Graingers financial strength, including its low debt and strong cash flow, leaves it well positioned to fund initiatives to accelerate top line growth. 8 In 2004, Grainger will be investing in the branch network and information technology including the following major items: $70 to $85 million for the branch network; $50 to $55 million for information technology; $15 to $20 million for the branch telephone system replacement and $10 million for completion of the logistics network. In 2004, total capital expenditures of $200 to $225 million are anticipated, more than double that of recent years. Capital spending for the market expansion program may be affected by decisions to lease, rather than purchase, the related facilities and or equipment. Matters Affecting Comparability. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, (Issue 02 16) in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in January 2003. For more detailed information regarding this change in accounting, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Graingers accounting treatment for vendor provided funds was consistent with Issue 02 16, with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances, which had been accounted for as an offset to operating (advertising) expenses. This accounting treatment is only allowable under Issue 02 16 in certain specific circumstances. As a result of Issue 02 16, Grainger will classify the majority of its vendor provided allowances as an offset to cost of merchandise sold rather than operating (advertising) expenses. Application of Issue 02 16 is on a prospective basis as contracts are either modified or renewed. Since a majority of the 2003 contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to December 31, 2002, the amounts classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold of $7.9 million were not material to 2003. This change does not have any effect on net earnings. Graingers operating results for 2003 include the operating results of Gemplers, a direct marketing division of Gemplers, Inc., from the acquisition date of April 14, 2003. Gemplers results are included in the Lab Safety segment. Effective January 1, 2002, Grainger adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of the application of the new impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, Grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings in 2002 of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) related to the write down of Acklands goodwill. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2002, Acklands sales declined as automotive aftermarket parts sales were eliminated due to the creation of the joint venture with Uni Select Inc. in Canada. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Graingers Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For the Years Ended December 31, Items in Consolidated Statements Percent Increase/ of Earnings as a Percent of (Decrease) Net Sales from Prior Year 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.5 % (2.3 )% Cost of merchandise sold 64.9 65.6 66.6 (0.6 ) (3.8 ) Operating expenses 26.8 25.9 26.3 3.8 (3.7 ) Operating earnings 8.3 8.5 7.1 (1.5 ) 16.1 Other income (expense) (0.1 ) 0.1 (0.8 ) (231.8 ) 111.3 Income taxes 3.3 3.5 2.6 (5.1 ) 32.3 Cumulative effect of accounting change expense 0.5 100.0 N/A Net earnings 4.9 % 4.6 % 3.7 % 7.3 % 21.2 % 2003 Compared to 2002 Graingers net sales of $4,667.0 million for 2003 were essentially flat compared to 2002. Full year results were affected by the general weakness in the U.S. economy. Sales in the Branch based Distribution business segment increased $19.2 million over 2002, generally unchanged year over year. Revenue increased in the Lab Safety segment, while sales for Integrated Supply declined. 9 Despite the limited sales growth experienced during the year, gross profit margins improved in 2003 to 35.1% from 34.4% principally due to favorable changes in product mix and selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs. Graingers operating earnings of $387.3 million in 2003 decreased 1.5% from the prior year. Operating margins declined to 8.3% in 2003 from 8.5% in 2002 reflecting higher operating expenses year over year. The principal driver of the operating expense increase was higher severance and healthcare expenses. Advertising expenses increased as a result of the classification of $7.9 million of vendor provided allowances in cost of merchandise sold rather than in operating (advertising) expenses. Graingers net earnings of $227.0 million in 2003 increased $15.4 million or 7.3% as compared with 2002 net earnings of $211.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the year increased to $2.46 in 2003 from $2.24 in 2002. In 2002, Grainger recorded a $23.9 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results for 2002 also included an after tax gain of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, on the reduction of restructuring reserves established for the shutdown of Material Logic. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch based Distribution Net sales at the Branch based Distribution businesses totaled $4,167.2 million in 2003 and were essentially flat when compared with 2002 sales of $4,148.0 million. Sales in the United States declined approximately 1% in 2003 as compared with 2002. Government account sales were up nearly 11% in 2003, while all other customer segments, including light and heavy manufacturing, were down when compared with 2002. The declines noted in the other customer segments were primarily due to the weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly in manufacturing. Within these customer segments, sales to national accounts increased approximately 2% over 2002. Sales growth through Internet channels continued in 2003, increasing 15.9% over 2002 and representing 12.6% of segment sales. Grainger will continue to invest in procurement technology to encourage online purchases by its customers and expects sales growth from Internet channels to continue in 2004. Sales in Canada increased 15.4% in 2003, principally due to a favorable exchange rate. In local currency, sales grew 2.7%, primarily in Ontario and national accounts. In Mexico, sales declined 3.7% in 2003 as compared with 2002, principally due to a weak economy in Mexico. Cost of merchandise sold of $2,682.6 million for 2003 in the Branch based Distribution businesses was essentially flat compared to $2,699.4 million in 2002. Gross profit margins increased 0.7 percentage points to 35.6% in 2003 from 34.9% in 2002. Selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs both in the United States and Canada, combined with a favorable change in product mix, contributed to the margin increase. The classification of vendor provided allowances from operating (advertising) expenses to cost of merchandise sold also increased gross profit margin by 0.2 percentage points. Branch based Distribution operating expenses increased 3.9% in 2003, primarily due to higher severance and healthcare expenses and increased occupancy costs. The classification of vendor provided allowances from operating (advertising) expenses to cost of merchandise sold also contributed to the increase. Operating earnings of $390.2 million in 2003 declined by $4.7 million or 1.2% as compared with 2002. The increase in operating expenses year over year more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety increased by $18.7 million to $305.5 million in 2003, a 6.5% increase over 2002. The sales growth was attributable to incremental sales from Gemplers, acquired on April 14, 2003. Excluding the results of Gemplers, year over year net sales decreased 2.0% as a result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy. A major portion of Lab Safetys sales are to manufacturers. The overall decline in the manufacturing sector was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety markets. The gross profit margin of 42.0% decreased 0.8 percentage points due to incremental sales of Gemplers products, which have lower gross margins than the rest of Lab Safetys products. In addition, in 2003 there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales. Lab Safety operating expenses of $86.5 million increased 14.5% in 2003, when compared with $75.5 million for 2002. The primary driver of the year over year increase was the incremental costs associated with the addition of Gemplers during the year and higher spending on catalog media. As a result, operating earnings of $41.9 million for Lab Safety in 2003 declined 11.1% from operating earnings of $47.1 million in 2002. 10 Integrated Supply Integrated Supply net sales of $211.7 million in 2003 were $14.3 million lower than $226.0 million of net sales in 2002. The 6.3% decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements, as well as lower volumes from existing customers. The decrease in sales was partially offset by incremental sales at seven new customer sites. Sales include both product sales, which are passed through to the customer at cost, and management fees. Gross profit declined $1.9 million in 2003 due to lower management fees. Operating expenses of $22.1 million increased 5.4% in 2003, when compared with $21.0 million for 2002. The increase of $1.1 million was principally due to a higher provision for bad debts, combined with incremental costs associated with a systems upgrade. Operating earnings of $3.2 million in 2003 for Integrated Supply declined $3.0 million from operating earnings of $6.2 million in 2002. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $6.2 million of expense in 2003, an unfavorable change of $10.9 million as compared with $4.7 million of income in 2002. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense) Interest (expense), net of interest income $(2,668 ) $(1,590 ) Equity in loss of unconsolidated entities, net (2,288 ) (3,025 ) Write down of investments in unconsolidated entities (1,921 ) Unclassified net: Gains on sales of investment securities 1,208 7,308 Write down of investments (1,614 ) (3,192 ) Gains on sales of fixed assets, net 1,607 5,219 Other (495 ) (38 ) $(6,171 ) $ 4,682 In the fourth quarter of 2003, Grainger wrote off its investment in two Asian joint ventures resulting in an after tax charge to earnings of $1.9 million. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reduction in gains on sales of fixed assets resulted from the sale of one facility in 2003 versus two in 2002. Income Taxes Income taxes of $154.1 million in 2003 declined 5.1% as compared with $162.3 million in 2002. Graingers effective tax rates were 40.4% and 40.8% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding the effect of the equity losses in unconsolidated entities and the write down of these investments, which did not result in tax benefits, the effective income tax rates were 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for 2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower nondeductible losses in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada. 2002 Compared to 2001 Graingers net sales of $4,643.9 million for 2002 decreased 2.3% from net sales of $4,754.3 million in 2001. This decline resulted principally from decreases in the Branch based Distribution and Lab Safety segments and the elimination of the Digital segment. The decrease was partially offset by an 18.4% increase at Integrated Supply. The general weakness in the North American economy affected overall sales performance. Graingers cost of merchandise sold of $3,045.7 million for 2002 decreased 3.8% from the cost of merchandise sold of $3,165.0 million for 2001. This decrease was primarily volume related due to the decline in net sales and supply chain efficiencies. Operating expenses of $1,205.1 million for 2002 decreased 3.7% from operating expenses of $1,250.7 million for 2001. Operating expenses for 2002 included a pretax benefit related to a $1.9 million reduction of a portion of the Material Logic shutdown reserve established in 2001. Operating expenses for 2001 included a pretax restructuring charge of $39.1 million related to the shutdown of Material Logic. Despite tight expense controls in 2002, Grainger was unable to decrease expenses in line with the sales decline. Graingers operating earnings of $393.2 million for 2002 increased 16.1% from operating earnings of $338.6 million for 2001. Operating earnings were affected by a $1.9 million benefit and a $39.1 million expense for 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the restructuring charge established for Material Logic. The results for 2001 included operating losses for the Digital segment totaling $10.2 million. 11 Graingers net earnings of $211.6 million for 2002 increased 21.2% compared with 2001 net earnings of $174.5 million. Graingers diluted earnings per share for the year increased 21.7% to $2.24 in 2002 from $1.84 in 2001. The results for 2002 included an after tax charge of $23.9 million ($0.26 per diluted share) related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results for 2002 also included an after tax gain of $4.5 million ($0.04 per diluted share) from the sales of investment securities and an after tax gain of $1.2 million ($0.01 per diluted share) related to the reduction of restructuring reserves. The results for 2001 included an after tax charge of $36.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, related to the digital businesses described earlier. Excluding all of these items from both periods and excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle from 2002 results, net earnings increased 8.8% to $229.8 million in 2002 from $211.2 million in 2001, and earnings per share increased 9.4% to $2.44 in 2002 from $2.23 in 2001. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch based Distribution Net sales at the Branch based Distribution businesses amounted to $4,148.0 million in 2002, a 2.4% decrease as compared with 2001 sales of $4,251.6 million. Sales in the United States decreased slightly in 2002 as compared with 2001 primarily due to weakness in the North American economy. While 2002 sales to government and national accounts increased 13% and 6%, respectively, when compared with the prior year, sales declines in other categories offset those increases. The increased sales to government and national accounts were primarily due to sales and marketing programs focused on developing these markets. Sales were favorably affected by continued momentum in Graingers Internet programs. For 2002, Internet channels processed sales of $419.5 million, a 26% increase from the $332.5 million processed in 2001. Grainger continued to focus on converting its customers to purchasing online. Grainger has experienced incremental revenue across all channels from customers who convert to online purchasing. In Canada, sales decreased 12.6% in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the elimination of automotive aftermarket parts sales as a result of the joint venture with Uni Select Inc., established on February 1, 2002. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the impact of the joint venture, sales were down 5.2% for the year due to the weakness in the natural resources sector and the loss of a few major accounts. In Mexico, sales decreased 5.0% in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was attributable to the weak economy in Mexico, partially offset by selected price increases intended to offset the declining value of the peso. Gross profit margins improved due to selected pricing actions in 2002 intended to cover freight and supplier cost increases and to favorable product mix. Partially offsetting these improvements were an unfavorable change in selling price category mix and higher freight costs related to the logistics project. Operating expenses increased 1.7% in 2002 versus 2001. Operating expenses increased due to higher payroll and benefits expenses, partially offset by lower advertising from fewer catalogs being printed and lower bad debt expenses from fewer bankruptcies of large customers. Operating earnings of $394.9 million increased 2.2% in 2002 as compared with $386.3 million for 2001. The effect of higher gross profit margins was partially offset by lower sales and an increase in operating expenses. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety amounted to $286.8 million in 2002, an 11.7% decrease compared with 2001 sales of $324.8 million. Sales at Lab Safety included the results of The Ben Meadows Co., a company acquired on February 26, 2001. The sales decrease was primarily the result of weak sales in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Cost of merchandise sold of $164.2 million for 2002 at Lab Safety decreased by $24.3 million as compared with $188.5 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily volume related due to the sales decline. Lab Safety operating expenses declined $9.7 million in 2002, primarily the result of second quarter 2002 workforce reductions and other cost control measures, including lower advertising expenditures. Operating earnings of $47.1 million at Lab Safety decreased 7.8% in 2002 as compared with $51.1 million for 2001. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily the result of lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Integrated Supply Net sales at Integrated Supply amounted to $226.0 million in 2002, an 18.4% increase over 2001 sales of $190.8 million. Sales growth for this business was primarily the result of increased penetration of existing customers and includes both product sales and management fees. Integrated Supply had operating income of $6.2 million in 2002 compared with $0.4 million in 2001. This improvement in operating performance for 2002 was the result of eliminating or restructuring unprofitable contracts throughout 2001 and productivity gains attained by leveraging the existing cost structure. Operating income for 2002 also benefited from lower bad debt expense compared with 2001, where provisions were made for losses related to two large customer bankruptcies. 12 Digital In April 2001, Grainger announced that it would shut down the operations of Material Logic, with the exception of FindMRO. Material Logic was launched in January 2001 as a utility for large customers to facilitate the purchase of facilities maintenance products over the Internet. Material Logic would have allowed large customers to access a single, networked catalog containing easily searchable and detailed product information, pre negotiated prices and availability information for indirect materials from major distributors. In order for Material Logic to grow, it needed broad industry support and funding from other equity participants. Grainger closed Material Logic because economic and market conditions made it difficult to find funding partners and the market developed more slowly than anticipated. In connection with this announcement, Grainger took a pretax charge of $39.1 million in 2001. Beginning with the 2001 third quarter, the Digital segment ceased operations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective June 1, 2001, FindMRO was added to the Branch based Distribution segment. Consequently, no results were reported for the Digital segment in 2002, but $30.0 million of net sales were reported in 2001. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $4.7 million of income in 2002, an improvement of $46.0 million as compared with $41.3 million of expense in 2001. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense) Interest (expense), net of interest income $ (1,590 ) $ (7,847 ) Equity in loss of unconsolidated entities, net (3,025 ) (7,205 ) Loss on liquidation of investment in unconsolidated entity (20,123 ) Unclassified net: Gains on sales of investment securities 7,308 138 Write down of investments (3,192 ) (7,400 ) Gains on sales of fixed assets, net 5,219 1,613 Other (38 ) (469 ) $ 4,682 $ (41,293 ) In April 2001, Grainger wrote down its investment in other digital businesses and took a pretax charge of $25.1 million. This included the loss on the divestiture of Graingers 40% investment in Works.com, Inc. (Works.com). Grainger acquired its ownership in Works.com, an unrelated third party, on August 1, 2000, when Graingers OrderZone.com business unit was combined with Works.com. Of this pretax charge, $20.1 million related to the divestiture of Works.com and was reported on the income statement as Loss on liquidation of investment in unconsolidated entity. Additionally, a loss of $5.0 million was included in Unclassifiednet relating to the write down to net realizable value of investments in other digital businesses. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income taxes of $162.3 million in 2002 increased 32.3% as compared with $122.8 million in 2001. Graingers effective tax rates were 40.8% and 41.3% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The rate decrease in 2002 as compared with 2001 was primarily due to a reduction of losses in unconsolidated entities. The effective tax rate for 2001 was also higher due to the write down of investments which did not result in tax benefits. Partially offsetting these items, which increased the 2001 tax rate, was the tax effect of the write off of investment in unconsolidated entity that had tax benefits disproportionate to the write off. Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate was 40.5% for both 2002 and 2001. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2002, Grainger adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the second quarter of 2002, Grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under SFAS No. 142. Fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that discounted future cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows. As a result of the application of the impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, Grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) related to the write down of goodwill of its Canadian subsidiary, Acklands. Previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows, whereas new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows, which are lower. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 13 Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue, allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives, capital expenditures and payment of cash dividends. Cash Flow Net cash flows from operations of $394.1 million in 2003, $303.5 million in 2002 and $509.2 million in 2001 continued to improve Graingers financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements. Net cash provided by operations in 2003 increased $90.6 million over 2002. The change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of $55.8 million in 2003, primarily from a decrease in inventory partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable. The reduced inventory resulted from efficiencies realized from the redesigned logistics network, and the decrease in trade accounts payable was due to lower inventory purchases during the fourth quarter. The majority of the decrease in net cash flows from operations from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to the 2002 inventory infusion to improve service levels and position the Branch based Distribution segment to gain share in an economic recovery. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $105.3 million, $105.8 million and $114.1 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital expenditures for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software were $80.5 million, $144.0 million and $107.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. Grainger also funded $36.7 million in 2003 to purchase Gemplers, and $14.4 million in 2001 to purchase Ben Meadows, both of which are part of the Lab Safety segment. Net cash used in financing activities for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $97.9 million, $158.1 million and $287.1 million, respectively. Graingers funding of treasury stock purchases decreased $58.7 million in 2003 as Grainger repurchased 918,300 shares in 2003 as compared with 2,221,500 shares in 2002. Treasury stock purchases were 1,820,000 in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 9.1 million shares of common stock remained available under Graingers repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $67.3 million in 2003, $66.5 million in 2002 and $65.4 million in 2001. In 2001, more cash from financing activities was required to pay off a higher level of short term debt than in 2002. Working Capital Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements, business development and systems and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $926.8 million at December 31, 2003, compared with $898.7 million at December 31, 2002, and $838.8 million at December 31, 2001. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.3, 2.5 and 2.5, respectively, at such dates. The current ratio decreased slightly in 2003 due to Graingers cross currency swap debt being reclassified from long term debt to current maturities of long term debt in 2003, which increased current liabilities at a higher rate than current assets. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (In thousands of dollars) Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 24,960 $ 61,083 $ 26,534 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 49,104 72,895 73,917 Subtotal 74,064 133,978 100,451 Capitalized software 6,422 10,047 6,717 Total $ 80,486 $144,025 $107,168 In 2003, Grainger continued to invest in the logistics network and information technology upgrades, as well as normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Higher capital spending in prior years reflects incremental spending for the logistics network project, which began in 2000. Capital expenditures are expected to be $200 to $225 million in 2004 and include investments for branches, information technology, replacement of the branch phone system and completion of the logistics network. The level of investment in branches may be influenced by decisions to lease, rather than purchase, the related facilities and or equipment. Grainger believes that cash flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the 2004 capital investments from existing working capital. 14 Restructuring In 2001, Grainger shut down the operations of Material Logic, with the exception of FindMRO, and as a result took a pretax charge of $39.1 million. Grainger has charged $35.9 million against the reserve, of which $23.0 million represented cash payments. Grainger has also reduced its estimate of expense by $2.5 million since 2001. As of December 31, 2003, $0.6 million of the reserve remains for future severance payments and, if not settled early, lease payments. All expenditures will be finalized in 2004. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit. At December 31, 2003, Graingers long term debt was rated AA+ by Standard & Poors, a rating it has held since 1987. Graingers available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $265.4 million, $264.7 million and $413.1 million, as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 7.5%, 7.2% and 7.8% as of the same dates. In September 2002, Grainger received net proceeds of $113.7 million from the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding long term debt in the amount of C$180.4 million. The long term debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been designated by Grainger as a nonderivative hedge of Graingers net investment in its Canadian subsidiary. Grainger entered into a two year cross currency swap on September 25, 2002, which replaced the Canadian dollar long term debt as a hedge of the net investment in Graingers Canadian subsidiary. The counterparty to the financial instrument is an investment grade financial institution. Grainger does not expect any loss from nonperformance by this counterparty. Since Grainger has the ability to refinance the commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity, and its intent is to keep the debt outstanding for the two year period of the cross currency swap, the commercial paper has been classified as long term debt. As of December 31, 2003, Grainger had not determined if it will renew the cross currency swap when it comes due in 2004. As a result, this commercial paper debt has been classified as current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2003. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. Holders of industrial revenue bonds may require Grainger to redeem certain of the bonds, such as in response to changes in interest rates. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2003, Graingers contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Less than 1 3 4 5 More than Committed 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands of dollars) Long term debt obligations $ 149,030 $144,135 $ 4,895 $ $ Capital lease obligations Operating lease obligations 60,045 18,192 22,585 11,885 7,383 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 9,247 9,247 Commitments to purchase inventory 166,567 166,567 Other purchase obligations 41,824 33,498 7,538 788 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet Total $ 426,713 $371,639 $35,018 $12,673 $ 7,383 15 Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product. The above table does not include $68.0 million of accrued employment related benefits costs, of which $42.1 million is related to Graingers postretirement benefits, because it is not certain when these liabilities will come due. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Graingers results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of Graingers financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits. Postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. Changes in assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Graingers postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. On December 31, 2003, Grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 6.5% to 6.0%. Grainger estimates that the noted reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease 2004 pretax earnings by approximately $1.4 million. Grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the S&P 500 to develop its expected long term return on plan assets. In 2003, Grainger increased the expected long term rate of return on plan assets (net of tax at 40%) from 5.4% to 6.0% based on the improved performance of the postretirement trust funds and the historical average long term rates of return. The increase in the expected return on plan assets in 2003 is not anticipated to have a material affect on 2004 pretax earnings. Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. 16 While Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates, and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and therefore, may affect Graingers retirement plan obligations and future expense. Further, the benefit obligation and net periodic cost may be significantly affected by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) enacted in December 2003. The plan may also need to be amended in order to benefit from the Act. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves. Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current periods results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including: age of the receivable, the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivable and publicly available default rates. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. In 2001, reserves were increased in anticipation of adverse economic conditions. The economic downturn that followed did not result in the incremental write offs expected and as a result, the reserve requirement declined. Write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends or published default rates. Historically, the allowance established for doubtful accounts has been adequate without requiring material adjustment. Inventory Reserves. Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting Graingers inventory values and cost of merchandise sold. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on Graingers results of operations. Historically, the reserves established for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory have been adequate without material adjustments. Other. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies relating to revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long lived assets, income taxes and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, etc. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the LIFO method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. 17 The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward Looking Statements This document contains forward looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward looking statements relate to Graingers expected future financial results and business plans, strategies and objectives and are not historical facts. They are often identified by qualifiers such as will, expects, intends, is likely, when completed, anticipates, believes, positioned to, continue, estimates or similar expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause Graingers results to differ materially from what is projected. Factors that may affect forward looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on Graingers businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; changes in laws and regulations; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance. Trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates, general economic conditions, including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, global and other conflicts, job creation and employment levels, and other factors. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. During 2003 and 2002, Grainger partially hedged the net Canadian dollar investment in Acklands with either borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars or with a cross currency swap agreement. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2003, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a $0.3 million decrease in net income. Comparatively, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a $1.8 million increase in net income in 2002. A uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $0.3 million increase in income for 2003, as compared with a decrease in net income of $2.3 million for 2002. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices. Grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. Grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio. All of its long term debt at December 31, 2003, is variable rate debt. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the maturity schedule of the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003. A one percentage point increase in interest rates paid by Grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately $0.9 million for 2003 and $0.8 million for 2002. A corresponding increase in net income for the noted periods would have resulted had the interest rates paid decreased by one percentage point. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or long term debt levels. Grainger is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities directly.
