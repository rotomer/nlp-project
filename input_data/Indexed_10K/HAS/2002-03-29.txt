ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this document. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements concerning the Companys expectations and beliefs. See "Business Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors" for a discussion of other uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Summary A percentage analysis of results of operations follows: 2001 2000 1999 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 42.8 44.2 40.1 Gross profit 57.2 55.8 59.9 Amortization 4.3 4.2 4.1 Royalties, research and development 11.7 16.8 16.8 Advertising 10.2 12.0 10.8 Selling, distribution and administration 23.6 22.7 19.0 Restructuring 1.7 1.5 Loss on sale of business units 1.2 Interest expense 3.6 3.0 1.6 Other (income) expense, net .4 .2 (.4 ) Earnings (loss) before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 3.4 (6.0 ) 6.5 Income taxes 1.3 (2.2 ) 2.0 Net earnings (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change 2.1 (3.8 ) 4.5 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax Net earnings (loss) 2.1 % (3.8 )% 4.5 % (Thousands of Dollars Except Per Share Data) Results of Operations Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2001 were $59,732, or $.35 per diluted share. Net earnings (loss) for fiscal 2000 and 1999 were $(144,631) and $188,953, or $(.82) and $.93 per diluted share, respectively. Included in net earnings for 2001 is a $1,066 net of tax charge relating to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities." Costs incurred in the Companys International segment relating to the deteriorating Argentine business environment and the devaluation of the peso amounted to $11,290, net of tax, in 2001. Approximately half of this charge relates to the impact of the devaluation on US dollar denominated intercompany liabilities the Company held in Argentina. The Company is taking steps to settle these liabilities and does not currently anticipate a material amount of foreign currency loss arising from these liabilities in 2002. Included in the net loss for 2000 were pretax charges relating to the Companys consolidation program of $146,142. Actions for which the Company provided charges under this program in 2000 were completed in 2001, and the Company recorded a credit in 2001 of $1,795 relating to costs not expended. In 2000, the Company also recognized a $43,965 pretax loss in connection with the sale to Infogrames Entertainment S.A. (Infogrames) of certain business units comprising Hasbro Interactive and Games.com. The sale of these business units closed in January 2001. A dispute 22 with respect to certain post closing adjustments to the sales price was resolved with no material impact to the Companys results of operations. During fiscal 1999, net earnings included the impact of $141,575 of pretax consolidation program charges. A credit adjustment to these planned costs of $6,128 was recorded in 2000, as the 1999 consolidation plan came to completion. Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 30, 2001 were $2,856,339 compared to $3,787,215 in 2000, a decrease of 25%. Most of the Companys revenues and operating earnings result from its three principal segments: U.S. Toys, Games and International. U.S. Toys Net revenues in the U.S. Toys segment increased by 6% in 2001 over 2000. The increase is due primarily to sales of product in connection with the Companys key license agreement with Disney, which were positively impacted by the November 2001 theatrical release of MONSTERS, INC., sales of preschool product tied to BOB THE BUILDER, product sales tied to the theatrical release of JURASSIC PARK III and increased product sales from certain of the Companys core brands, primarily GI JOE. The increased sales of these products offset the $71,000 decrease in U.S. Toys segment revenue from the sale of POKEMON related products. U.S. Toys operating profit for the year ended December 30, 2001 of $86,339 compared with a prior year operating loss, excluding consolidation program charges, of $145,761. In addition to higher gross margin and lower royalty expense arising from the mix of products sold in 2001, more effective management resulting from the consolidation of the U.S. Toys segment into essentially one location at the end of 2000 as part of the consolidation program, as well as the Companys focus on cost reduction resulted in lower product development, advertising and promotion, marketing and sales and administration costs in 2001. Games Games segment revenues declined to $1,108,232 from 2000 levels of $1,843,104. Included in the 2000 results of the Games segment were revenues and operating losses derived from sales of interactive software games, and costs associated with development of an online interactive game initiative, Games.com. In December 2000, the Company announced the sale of the business units which made up Hasbro Interactive as well as Games.com to Infogrames. This sale closed in January 2001. Net revenues of the business units sold were $194,300 in 2000. Games segment revenues were also negatively impacted from 2000 levels by an approximate $469,000 decline in revenues from POKEMON products, primarily trading card games, and an additional approximate $54,000 decline in revenue from FURBY products. Revenues from certain core products, such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING and family and adult games, increased, as well as those derived from the combination of certain core brands and key licenses, such as Disney MONOPOLY. However, these increases were insufficient to offset the decreases noted above. With an overall 40% decrease in revenue, the Games segment had operating profit of $82,280 in 2001 compared to $162,648 in 2000. Operating profit of the Games segment in 2000 included operating losses of the business units sold to Infogrames of $(104,200). International International segment revenues decreased 23% in 2001 compared to 2000, including an approximate $288,000 decline in revenue from POKEMON and FURBY products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on International segment revenues. Due primarily to this decline in revenue, International segment operating profit in 2001 of $32,224 declined 40% from the 2000 level of $53,782. 23 Other segments Revenues from the Retail segment, which represents the retail operations of Wizards of the Coast, were $51,019 in 2001 compared with $57,328 in 2000. Operating loss of this segment of $(36,897) in 2001 includes a charge of approximately $16,000 associated with impairment of long lived assets. The Company expects that revenues and related expenses of entertainment based products are higher in the year of a theatrical release. STAR WARS: EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is scheduled for a worldwide theatrical release in May 2002. Disney is expected to release MONSTERS, INC. outside of North America during early 2002 and LILO AND STITCH, for which the Company also has rights to produce product, is expected in theaters in June 2002. This will be the first full year of the Companys relationship with Disney. Consolidated net revenues for 2000 were $3,787,215 compared to $4,232,263 for 1999. This 11% decrease in net revenues from 1999 levels includes an approximate $129,800 worldwide unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation rates. In 2001, the Company reclassified its segment results for 2000 and 1999 to reflect the realignment of certain operating divisions. Toy related product formerly included in the Companys Other segments is now included in the U.S. Toys segment, and manufacturing operations in the former Global Operations segment were realigned with the marketing segment to which they related. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, net revenues decreased in two of the Companys three principal segments, U.S. Toys and International, and operating profit, excluding charges relating to the Companys consolidation programs, decreased in all segments. In U.S. Toys, the decline in revenues resulted predominately from a decline in sales of product related to STAR WARS: EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE, POKEMON toys and TELETUBBIES preschool products, offset in part by the United States introduction of ACTION MAN. Coupled with the decline in revenues, lower gross profit margins on product sold in 2000, and early 2000 higher administrative overhead and expenditures for items such as advertising resulted in an operating loss. In the International segment, the decline in sales of STAR WARS product was largely offset by shipments of POKEMON toy and non trading card game related products. The decline in revenues was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Higher product costs on items sold in 2000 contributed to the decline in operating profit for this segment. In the Companys Games segment, revenues increased over 1999 levels, while operating profits, before consolidation program charges and loss on sale of business units, decreased by 35%. The increased revenues are due in large part to the 2000 full year inclusion of trading card games from Wizards of the Coast, Inc. (Wizards), acquired in the fourth quarter of 1999, while decreased operating profits primarily resulted from a significant decline in sales of FURBY and related lost profit. Net revenues in 1999 of the business units sold to Infogrames were $237,200, while the related operating loss, excluding consolidation program charges, was $(89,032). The Companys gross profit margin increased in 2001 to 57.2% from 55.8% in 2000, which compares with 59.9% in 1999. The increase in margin primarily reflects product mix, and to a lesser degree, lower obsolescence costs incurred in 2001 versus 2000. The Company has actively managed inventory in 2001 to coincide with a lower planned level of business activity, attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence. The Companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items, which could result in higher obsolescence costs. In 2000, margin increases expected over 1999 were not realized largely due to obsolescence cost incurred associated with overproduction of certain trading card games, primarily POKEMON related. The Company expects gross margin to increase in 2002 due to higher margins associated with sales of product relating to entertainment based properties. Amortization expense of $121,652 in 2001 includes goodwill amortization of $43,850 and amortization of product rights of $77,802. During 2000, the $157,763 of amortization expense 24 recorded included impairment charges of $25,046 resulting from discontinued product line offerings arising from the Companys decision to focus on developing its core brands. This compares with $173,533 in 1999 which included, as part of the consolidation program, $38,449 in impairment charges arising from decisions to discontinue or significantly reduce product line offerings. At the beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company will adopt the provisions of FASB Statements 141 "Business Combinations," and 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Statement 141 specifies the criteria intangible assets acquired must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Statement No. 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead, be tested for impairment at least annually. Statement 141 will require, upon adoption of Statement 142, that the Company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill acquired in prior purchase business combinations, and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in Statement 141 for recognition apart from goodwill. Upon adoption of Statement 142, the Company will also be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations, and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption. In addition, to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life, the Company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142 within the first interim period. Any impairment loss arising from this assessment would be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in this period. Statement 142 will require the Company to also perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. This assessment and analysis of its results is required to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Companys statement of operations. Because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting Statements 141 and 142, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these Statements on the Companys financial statements. While goodwill will no longer be amortized in 2002, the Company does expect that amortization expense related to product rights will increase in 2002. This is due to higher revenues expected in 2002 relating to STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES related product and the resultant impact of higher amortization of product rights obtained in connection with this entertainment property. Expenditures for royalties, research and development decreased to $335,358 from $635,366 in 2000 and $711,790 in 1999. Included in these amounts are expenditures for research and development of $125,633 in 2001, $208,485 in 2000 and $254,599 in 1999. As percentages of net revenues, research and development was 4.4% in 2001, down from 5.5% in 2000 and 6.0% in 1999. In 1999, contractual development commitments recognized for product lines discontinued in connection with the 1999 consolidation program amounted to $10,992. Absent the impact of costs associated with the business units sold to Infogrames, research and development expense would have been 3.9% in 2000 and 4.1% in 1999. The decrease in dollars in 2001 reflects the Companys focus on reduced spending, and synergies achieved from centralizing the U.S. Toys segment development team into one location. The Company anticipates that research and development expense will increase in 2002 as it continues its focus on efforts to develop its core brand strategy, including development of product related to strategic licenses. Royalty expense decreased to $209,725, or 7.3% of net revenues in 2001 from $426,881 in 2000. Excluding charges of $42,270 in 2000 and $15,300 in 1999 relating to royalty commitments on discontinued product lines and product lines with significantly reduced expectations recognized in connection with the Companys consolidation programs, royalty expenditures were approximately 10.2% and 10.4% of net revenues in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenues derived from entertainment based properties, such as STAR WARS, and resultant royalties, while continuous over the life of a contract, are generally higher in amount in the year a theatrical release takes place. The degree to which revenues, 25 royalties and operating profits fluctuate is dependent not only on theatrical release dates, but video release dates as well. The Company anticipates that royalty expense will increase in 2002 related to sales of product associated with STAR WARS: EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Due to the royalties associated with this license, the Company expects that operating profits derived from sales of associated products will not increase commensurate with the revenues received from those sales. Advertising expense decreased to $290,829, or 10.2% of net revenues, compared to 12.0% and 10.8% of net revenues in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Included in 2000 expense is $3,155 related to contractual commitments on discontinued product lines arising from the Companys 2000 consolidation program. The decrease in 2001 results from lower expenditures coinciding with lower revenues, lower media costs and a more efficient use of advertising spending. While the Company does not expect 2002 advertising expense to increase significantly as a percentage of 2002 net revenues, it does anticipate that the dollars expended in 2002 will increase over 2001. Selling, distribution and administration costs decreased in dollars but increased as a percentage of lower net revenues in 2001 to $675,482, from $863,496 in 2000 and $799,919 in 1999. Of the $188,000 decrease in dollars from 2000, approximately $75,000 is attributable to the business units sold to Infogrames in January 2001. Reductions in marketing, sales and administration expenses related to expense reduction programs account for 82% of the remaining $113,000, with the remaining 18% arising from reduced distribution expenses which are largely volume related. The Company is continuing its focus on reducing expenses in this area in 2002, and does not anticipate an increase in dollars or percentage of revenue in 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company implemented a plan to consolidate its U.S. Toys group into Rhode Island, significantly reduce overhead through reductions in product development, sales and marketing, and administrative functions across the Company and to increase its focus on development of the Companys core brands. In 2000, the Company recorded a total of $152,270 in expense relating to this plan, $70,079 of restructuring expense and $82,191 of expense in other operating categories, including $6,625 to cost of sales, $25,046 in amortization, $42,270 in royalties, research and development, $3,155 in advertising and $5,095 in selling, distribution and administration expense. The significant components of the 2000 plan included the closing of offices in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Napa, California office and warehouse and a small office in San Francisco, California, thereby essentially consolidating the U.S. Toys group in Rhode Island. Additionally, the plan included the reduction of overhead, particularly in marketing and sales, product development and administration, including a curtailment of expansion of the retail business of Wizards, the further consolidation of certain international operating offices into regional centers and consolidation and streamlining of the Companys marketing activities. These actions were completed in 2001, and have resulted in a restructuring credit of $(1,795). The credit results primarily from adjustments due to lower than expected severance costs to complete the plan. The 2000 plan also included the refocus of the Company on developing and marketing its core brands and reducing its reliance on licenses. This focus resulted in product lines which were discontinued or for which the Company has significantly reduced expectations. The components of the plan included in the restructuring charge of $70,100 in the 2000 statement of operations were severance costs of $31,800, lease costs of $21,400 and fixed asset write offs of $16,900. Fixed asset write offs were recorded in 2000. Remaining balances accrued at December 30, 2001 include $2,700 of severance benefits remaining to be paid to terminated 26 employees over their remaining entitlement period, and $10,300 of lease payments remaining on closed facilities. Details of activity in the restructuring plan for fiscal 2001 follow: Balance at December 31, 2000 Activity Adjustment Balance at December 30, 2001 Severance $ 31,800 (27,305 ) (1,795 ) 2,700 Lease costs 21,400 (11,100 ) 10,300 $ 53,200 (38,405 ) (1,795 ) 13,000 Employee redundancies by area: Manufacturing activities 27 (27 ) Research, product development, marketing, sales, and administration 322 (315 ) (7 ) 349 (342 ) (7 ) Total charges under the 2000 plan represented cash charges of approximately $31,800 for severance benefits disbursed over the employees entitlement period, $21,400 for lease costs to be expended over the contractual lease term of the closed facilities and approximately $31,100 of contractual commitments on exited product lines and certain other licensed product lines with reduced expectations due to the Companys enhanced focus on its core brands. The product lines exited were not, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the Companys revenues or operating results. Total non cash charges were $62,900. Non cash charges of $16,900 for fixed asset write offs related primarily to Corporate and the U.S. Toys segment. The remaining approximately $46,000 relates to asset write offs and a write down of assets impaired due to the Companys enhanced focus on its core brands. This included impairment of intangible assets arising from the decision to discontinue product line offerings. Non cash charges related to asset write offs were credited to the respective line items on the balance sheet in 2000. While the Company realized benefits from the consolidation of operations and focus on core product lines throughout its income statement, it achieved pretax savings directly related to specific actions under the restructuring plan of $51,000 in 2001 and anticipates continued savings of approximately $53,000 in 2002. In December 1999, the Company announced a program to consolidate manufacturing and sourcing activities and product lines, as well as to streamline and further regionalize marketing, sales and research and development activities worldwide. Costs associated with the 1999 consolidation program, recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999, amounted to $141,575, of which $64,232 was recorded as a restructuring charge and $77,343 in various other operating expense categories. Adjustments to the restructuring plan of $(6,128) were recorded in 2000. The significant components of the plan included the closing of factories in Mexico and in the United Kingdom, reducing capacity at remaining factories, shifting production to third party manufacturers in the Far East and further consolidation and regionalization of the International marketing and sales structure. Actions under the plan commenced in December 1999 and were completed in fiscal 2000. There were no material changes to the plan, however, adjustments were recognized in 2000 reflecting the reversal of excess restructuring accruals due to lower than previously estimated costs to achieve the overall objectives of the plan, primarily in the consolidation and regionalization of the International marketing and sales structure. Approximately 2,200 employees were terminated as part of the 1999 plan. The plan included approximately $38,700 of cash charges for severance benefits expended over the employees entitlement period, $14,300 of cash charges for lease costs to be expended over the contractual lease terms and non cash charges of $11,200 for fixed asset write offs, arising primarily in the manufacturing area. Non cash charges relating to fixed asset write offs were credited to the respective line items on the balance sheet. At December 30, 2001, the remaining liability of $3,000 relates to lease costs, which are being expended over the contractual lease term. 27 The components of the consolidation program included in other operating expenses in 1999 represent costs associated with exiting certain product lines and reevaluating other product lines resulting in reduced expectations. The product lines being exited were not, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the Companys revenues or operating results. Approximately $12,000 represented cash charges which have been incurred on contractual royalty, product development and advertising commitments associated with the discontinued product lines. Non cash charges of approximately $65,000 related to asset write offs and write downs of underutilized assets, including impairment of intangible assets arising from the decision to discontinue or significantly reduce product line offerings. The resulting sum of undiscounted future cash flows of these assets was not sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the assets, and as such, they were written down to their fair market value. Items relating to property rights and licenses, goodwill, inventory, prepaid and other current assets were credited to the respective asset in the balance sheet. As noted above, in December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain business units comprising Hasbro Interactive, as well as its internet portal, Games.com, to Infogrames for Infogrames securities and cash. The sale of the business units closed in January 2001. Net assets of the business units sold were written down to estimated fair value as of December 31, 2000, resulting in the recognition of a pretax loss of $43,965. During 2001, the Company was engaged in arbitration proceedings with Infogrames regarding a dispute over the amount of post closing adjustments to the sales proceeds in connection with this sale. The dispute was settled with no material adjustments to the Companys results of operations. Proceeds from the sale were $56,200, of which $1,000 was in cash, $1,000 was in redeemable preferred stock of Hasbro Interactive and the remainder was in common stock of Infogrames. Interest expense decreased to $103,688 in 2001 from $114,421 in 2000, which was up from the $69,340 incurred in 1999. The decrease in 2001 is primarily due to lower short term debt in 2001 over 2000. The increase in 2000 over prior periods largely reflects the costs associated with funding the Companys 1998 and 1999 acquisitions and the Companys stock repurchase program. In November 2001, the Company issued $250,000 of 2.75% convertible senior debentures. Proceeds from this issuance were used to repurchase debt carrying higher interest rates. Due to this issuance and lower projected borrowing levels in 2002, the Company expects interest expense to decrease in 2002. Other expense of $11,443 in 2001 and $7,288 in 2000 compare to income of $15,616 in 1999. A lower level of interest income coupled with an increase in losses on foreign currency transactions, including the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, account for the majority of increased 2001 net expense. Expense in 2000 relates primarily to the write down of investments held for sale which have experienced an other than temporary decline in value, coupled with a higher level of transactional losses resulting from an unfavorable movement in foreign currency. Income tax expense was 36.8% of pretax earnings in 2001. Income tax benefit on the 2000 pretax loss was 36.0%, compared with income tax expense of 31.0% in 1999. The higher 2001 and 2000 rates reflect the tax expense of operating profits in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and operating losses in jurisdictions where benefits are not currently realizable. 28  During 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" which required that the Company record all derivatives, such as foreign exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the derivative fair values that are designated, effective and qualify as cash flow hedges, are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (AOCE) until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of adopting Statement 133 and in accordance with the transition provisions, the Company recorded a one time after tax charge of $1,066 or $(.01) per share during 2001 representing the cumulative effect of the adoption in its consolidated statements of operations and an after tax unrealized loss of $753 to AOCE, which the Company has reclassified to earnings through cost of sales in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Hasbro has historically generated a significant amount of cash from normal operations. Seasonal financing requirements have been met with the use of short term borrowings, which in 2001 included borrowings under a secured committed line of credit, and in prior years, issuance of commercial paper as well as borrowings under the Companys lines of credit. Long term debt has increased from nil in 1997, to $1,165,649, excluding current installments, at December 30, 2001. This long term debt has been used primarily to fund the Companys 1998 and 1999 business acquisitions, as well as the repurchase of the Companys common stock in the open market. During 2001, the Company made no acquisitions of businesses or repurchases of its common stock. At December 30, 2001, cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings, were $199,071. This compares with cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings of $(99,177) and $(430,368) at December 31, 2000 and December 26, 1999, respectively. Hasbro generated approximately $372,000, $163,000 and $392,000 of net cash from its operating activities in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 from 2000 results primarily from the Companys aggressive management of its cash flow requirements. While both fourth quarter and full year 2001 revenues were down from 2000 levels, fourth quarter days sales outstanding improved to 52 days from 53 days in 2000. Accounts receivable at year end is primarily composed of fourth quarter revenues. Planned lower levels of business activity combined with improved inventory management resulted in inventory levels $118,000, or 35% lower at December 2001 than December 2000. Improved inventory management, a focus on reducing discretionary expenditures in areas such as advertising and cost savings achieved as part of the Companys consolidation programs resulted in lower levels of cash expended, and are reflected in lower prepaid assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities at the end of 2001 compared with 2000. Also included in prepaid and other current assets at the end of 2000 were assets held for sale in connection with the January 2001 sale of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com to Infogrames discussed above. In comparing 2000 with 1999, the 58% decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to the approximate $145,000 net loss incurred in 2000. Coupled with cash utilized to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the decrease was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts receivable results from a 27% decrease in revenues for the fourth quarter of 2000 versus the comparable period in 1999 and a greater proportion of cash collected on sales during the year. Inventory levels at the end of 2000 decreased from 1999 as a result of both lower production in anticipation of reduced shipments in the first quarter of 2001 and the write down of excess inventory, particularly trading card games, in the fourth quarter of 2000. As noted above, prepaid expenses and other current assets at the end of 2000 also included assets held for sale in regards to the Companys sale of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com to Infogrames. Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $57,779, $180,710 and $429,092 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During 2001, the Company expended approximately $50,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment while during 2000 and 1999 it expended 29 approximately $125,000 and $107,000, respectively. Of these amounts, 75% in 2001, 33% in 2000 and 53% in 1999 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. Under the terms of the Companys credit facility, the Company is restricted in the amount it can expend on additions to property, plant and equipment. The Company reduced its level of spending in 2001 below the level it was restricted to in 2001 under its then outstanding credit facilities, as part of its cash management process. During the three years ended December 30, 2001, depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was $104,247, $106,458 and $103,791, respectively. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2001. During 2000, the Company made several small acquisitions for approximately $58,000 in total, net of cash acquired, none of which were considered individually significant. Additionally, 2000 investing activities included post closing adjustments and contingent payments in relation to the September 1999 acquisition of Wizards. On September 30, 1999, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of Wizards, for an initial purchase price of $325,000, subject to additional payments based upon the closing balance sheet and future payments contingent upon achieving certain operating objectives. The Company also made other smaller acquisitions and investments in 1999, none of which was significant. Other investing activities in 2000 largely reflects a reduction in intangible and other long term assets of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com, which were sold to Infogrames. Under the terms of the Companys credit facility, the Company is restricted in the amount it can expend on future acquisitions. The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected makes it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2001, the Company utilized cash from operations and borrowing under its secured amended and restated revolving credit and line of credit agreements to meet its cash flow requirements. At December 30, 2001, the Company had a committed secured revolving credit agreement of $325,000, maturing in February 2003. The secured committed line of credit of an additional $325,000, available to the Company during most of the year, was no longer required by the Company and was canceled in December 2001. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants throughout the fiscal year ended December 30, 2001. In order to extend the term of the existing agreement, provide additional amounts for working capital needs and remove certain restrictions regarding the retirement of long term debt, the Company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with its existing bank group dated March 19, 2002. This amended and restated facility increased the amount available to the Company for borrowing to $380,000, and has a final maturity date of March 2005. The facility continues to be secured by substantially all domestic accounts receivable and inventory, as well as certain intangible assets of the Company. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement. The agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number of other limitations, including with respect to capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed facility at March 3, 2002. Amounts available and unused under uncommitted lines at March 3, 2002 were $43,400. During 2000, the Company borrowed through the issuance of commercial paper and against short term lines of credit to fund its seasonal working capital requirements in excess of funds available from operations and the issuance of long term debt. The Company funds its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flow from operations, as well as utilizing borrowings under the Companys secured and unsecured credit facilities when needed. During 2002, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital 30 needs through operations and its revolving credit facility and believes that the funds available to it are adequate to meet its needs. The Company expects to be in compliance with its covenants in 2002. However, unforeseen circumstances, such as severe softness in or a collapse of the retail environment may result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results of the Company, thereby causing the Company to be in non compliance with its debt covenants. This may cause the Company to be unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility. In November and December of 2001, the Company issued $250,000 of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The proceeds from the sales along with cash on hand were used to repurchase $250,000 in original principal amount of existing long term debt, specifically $225,000 of the 7.95% notes due 2003, $4,000 of the 6.15% notes due 2008, and $21,000 of the 6.60% notes due 2028. Cash on hand was used to repurchase an additional $127 of the notes due in 2003. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment, with the rate not to exceed 11%, commencing in December 2005 depending on the price of the Companys stock. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument which is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, and changes in fair value will be recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds certain levels for a specified period of time, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2005, December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. The Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised. At December 30, 2001, the Company has remaining $324,873 of outstanding 7.95% Notes due in March 2003. It is the Companys current intent that cash flow from operations will be used to settle this obligation. During 2000, net financing activities utilized approximately $128,000 of funds of the Company, primarily as a result of the completion on March 27 of a "Modified Dutch Auction" tender offer, pursuant to which the Company accepted for payment approximately 18,086 shares of common stock, representing approximately 9.5% of outstanding shares, at a purchase price of $17.25 per share. The aggregate purchase, including fees and expenses associated with the tender offer, was approximately $313,000. Offsetting this utilization was net borrowing activities in 2000 which included the issuance of $550,000 of 7.95% notes due March 15, 2003 and $200,000 of 8.50% notes due March 15, 2006. During 1999, net financing activities provided approximately $146,000 of funds to the Company, primarily through the use of short term borrowings. On December 6, 1999, the Board authorized a common stock repurchase program up to $500,000. A portion of this authorization was used in 2000 in connection with the repurchase of shares through the Modified Dutch Auction discussed above. At December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, $204,500 remains available under the 1999 authorization. Shares acquired under the Board authorization are being used for corporate purposes including issuance upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. Under terms of the Companys revolving credit agreement, the Company is limited in its repurchase of its shares in the future to $5,000 per year. During 1999, the Company also invested approximately $240,000 to repurchase its common stock in the open market. Under the Companys bank credit agreement, dividend payments are restricted to the greater of $.03 per share quarterly or 25% of prior fiscal year consolidated net income. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and 31 liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, and recoverability of royalty advances and commitments. Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. The Company routinely commits to promotional allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the Company underproducing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded when deemed necessary. Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows. The preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. 32 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, and the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,167,953 of long term debt, including current installments, outstanding at December 30, 2001. Future payments required under these long term obligations are as follows: Payments due by Fiscal Year Certain Contractual Obligations 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total Long term debt, including current Installments $ 2,304 325,792 957 100,997 201,038 536,865 1,167,953 Operating lease commitments 35,218 29,508 24,621 19,804 13,576 51,588 174,315 Future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments 203,000 91,000 69,000 123,000 8,000 494,000 $ 240,522 446,300 94,578 243,801 222,614 588,453 1,836,268 Certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon theatrical release of the related entertainment property. In additional to the contractual obligations noted above, the Company has letters of credit of approximately $23,000 and inventory purchase commitments of approximately $46,000 outstanding at December 30, 2001. Financial Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of sourcing products in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than thirty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies, including those in Latin American countries. To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its estimated upcoming fiscal year foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts. From time to time, the Company may also hedge foreign currency exposure using purchased foreign currency options. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% unfavorable movement in the currencies involved could result in an approximate $17.7 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Company does not speculate in, and, other than set forth above, the Company does not hedge foreign currencies. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At December 30, 2001, the Company had fixed rate long term debt of $1,165,649. Interest rate changes affect the fair value of this fixed rate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this debt by approximately $65,500 or $75,200, respectively. 33 The Economy and Inflation The Company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2001. The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 48% and 41% of its consolidated net revenues in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In the past year certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate. On January 22, 2002, Kmart, one of the Companys top 5 customers, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, the Company did not have material outstanding net accounts receivable due from Kmart. However, during the 90 day period immediately preceding Kmarts filing, the Company received approximately $98,000 in total payments from Kmart. Based on an assessment of a number of factors, including the estimation of the likelihood of any preference claim being asserted against the Company as one of Kmarts significant suppliers and the Companys legal defenses, the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material negative impact on its financial position or results of operation. The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year more significant to its overall business. The trend of retailers over the past few years has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues. The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2001 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly. Other Information In May of 2001, the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom (the "OFT") advised the Companys U.K. subsidiary, Hasbro U.K. Ltd. ("Hasbro U.K."), of an inquiry into allegedly anti competitive pricing practices by Hasbro U.K. with respect to certain wholesale distributors in the U.K. The business covered by this inquiry represented less than 3% of Hasbro U.K.s total revenue for the relevant time period. In August of 2001, the Company received a further inquiry from the OFT seeking, among other things, information relating to Hasbro U.K.s trading arrangements with its direct retail accounts, which represent the bulk of its business in the United Kingdom. The Company is cooperating fully with the OFT in its inquiries. If a fine is imposed pursuant to the OFT inquiry, the Company currently estimates that the amount of the fine could range from approximately $236 to approximately $38,300. Because of a number of factors, including the relatively early stage of this inquiry, the lack of precedent under the applicable U.K. statute, and the significant appeal rights available to the Company in the event of an adverse determination by the OFT, there is no amount within this range which is a better estimate than any other amount in the range. Therefore, as required by applicable accounting standards, the Company accrued a charge to earnings equal to the low end of the range set forth above. As a result, any fine that is imposed in excess of this accrued amount would have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in the quarter in which such additional liability is fixed or resolved. While the Company believes that some fine will be imposed, it is the Companys position that the amount of any fine should be at or near the low end of the range set forth above, and it will be vigorously pursuing this position in its discussions with the OFT. The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position. 34 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS 143), which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or statement of financial position. In August 2001, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" (SFAS 144), which establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale as well as revising certain criteria specified in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121), for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses related to long lived assets. SFAS 144 superseded SFAS 121 and is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 144 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 and does not expect that the adoption will result in a material impact to its consolidated results of operations and financial position. In November 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 01 9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products)" (Issue No. 01 9). Issue No. 01 9 addresses vendor recognition, reporting characterization, timing of recognition and classification in the statement of operations of certain consideration given to a customer in connection with the sale of the vendors products. One of the provisions of Issue No. 01 9 was effective in 2001 and had no impact on net earnings or classification of revenue and expense in the Companys statement of operations. The remaining provisions of Issue No. 01 9 will be adopted by the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2002 and are not expected to materially impact revenue and expense classifications in the statement of operations or reported net earnings.
