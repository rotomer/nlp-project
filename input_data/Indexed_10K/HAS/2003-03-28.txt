ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this document. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements concerning the Companys expectations and beliefs. See "Business Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" for a discussion of other uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Summary A percentage analysis of results of operations follows: 2002 2001 2000 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 39.0 42.8 44.2 Gross profit 61.0 57.2 55.8 Amortization 3.4 4.3 4.2 Royalties 10.5 7.3 11.3 Research and product development 5.5 4.4 5.5 Advertising 10.5 10.2 12.0 Selling, distribution and administration 23.3 23.6 22.7 Restructuring 1.7 Loss on sale of business units 1.2 Interest expense 2.8 3.6 3.0 Other (income) expense, net 1.3 .4 .2 Earnings (loss) before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 3.7 3.4 (6.0 ) Income taxes 1.0 1.3 (2.2 ) Net earnings (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change 2.7 2.1 (3.8 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (8.8 ) Net earnings (loss) (6.1 )% 2.1 % (3.8 )% (Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data) Results of Operations Net loss for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002 was $170,674, or $.98 per diluted share. Net earnings (loss) for fiscal 2001 and 2000 were $59,732 and $(144,631), or $.35 and $(.82) per diluted share, respectively. Included in the net loss for 2002 is a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $(245,732), or $(1.42) per diluted share, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The 2002 net loss also includes a non cash charge, net of tax, of $31,747 for the write down of the Companys investment in Infogrames Entertainment S.A. ("Infogrames") common stock. This write down increased diluted loss per share by $.18. In addition, the 2002 net loss includes a charge of $7,566, or $.04 per diluted share, relating to a fine imposed on the Companys United Kingdom affiliate by the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom ("OFT") for alleged anti competitive pricing practices. The 2002 net loss was favorably impacted by the provisions of SFAS 142 which 22 eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives. The elimination of this amortization and its related tax effect had SFAS 142 been applied in 2001 and 2000 would have increased net earnings by $45,013 and $46,934, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $.26 and $.27, respectively. Also favorably impacting the 2002 net loss was interest income, net of tax, of $7,556, received on an IRS tax settlement in 2002. Included in net earnings for 2001 is a $1,066 net of tax charge relating to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities." Costs incurred in the Companys International segment relating to the deteriorating Argentine business environment and the devaluation of the peso amounted to $11,290, net of tax, in 2001. These costs negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $.07. Approximately half of this charge relates to the impact of the devaluation on U.S. dollar denominated intercompany liabilities the Company held in Argentina. Included in the net loss for 2000 were pretax charges relating to the Companys consolidation program of $146,142. These charges were $93,531, net of tax, and negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $.53. Actions for which the Company provided charges under this program in 2000 were completed in 2001, and the Company recorded a credit in 2001 of $1,795 relating to costs not expended. In 2000, the Company also recognized a $43,965 pretax loss in connection with the sale to Infogrames of certain business units comprising Hasbro Interactive and Games.com. The sale of these business units closed in January 2001. A dispute with respect to certain post closing adjustments to the sales price was resolved in January 2002 with no material impact to the Companys results of operations. The loss on the sale of these business units was $28,138, net of tax, and had a negative impact to 2000 diluted loss per share of $.16. Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 29, 2002 were $2,816,230 compared to $2,856,339 in 2001 and $3,787,215 in 2000. Most of the Companys revenues and operating earnings result from its three principal segments: U.S. Toys, Games and International. In 2002, the Company reclassified its segment results for 2001 and 2000 to reflect the realignment of certain operating divisions. U.S. Tiger toy lines previously included in the Games segment are now included in the U.S. Toys segment. Certain Tiger electronic games, primarily handheld, remain in the Games segment. In addition, the International operations of Tiger and Wizards of the Coast, previously included in Games, are now included as part of the International segment. U.S. Toys Net revenues in the U.S. Toys segment increased by 7% over 2001 to $996,496 in 2002. The increase is due primarily to sales of product in connection with the theatrical release of STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES in May 2002 and the video and DVD release in November of 2002. In addition, revenues were positively impacted by increased shipments of products related to certain core brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS and PLAYSKOOL products, as well as the introduction of BEYBLADES products. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of electronic interactive products, such as B.I.O. BUGS and POO CHI, remote control toys and, to a lesser extent, POKEMON products and E KARA. In addition, prior year sales were favorably affected by the 2001 theatrical and video releases of JURASSIC PARK III and Disneys MONSTERS, INC. U.S. Toys operating profit for the year ended December 29, 2002 was $75,664 compared with $15,808 in the prior year. The increase in operating profit was largely due to higher gross margins as the result of the mix of products sold in 2002 versus 2001. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased royalty expense resulting from higher sales of licensed products in 2002, primarily STAR WARS products. In addition to this, operating profit was positively impacted by lower sales and administration costs in 2002 as a result of the Companys focus on cost reduction and more effective management resulting from the consolidation of the U.S. Toys segment into essentially one location, a process begun in 2000. As noted above, gross margin and 23 royalty expense increased in 2002 because of increased sales of entertainment based products, principally STAR WARS products. Sales of product related to entertainment based properties, such as STAR WARS, typically carry a higher gross margin as well as a higher royalty rate with the resulting operating profit generally lower than it is for revenues derived from sales of Hasbro owned brands. Higher amortization expense in 2002 relating to the product rights associated with STAR WARS was offset by the elimination of amortization of goodwill and product rights deemed to have an indefinite life as the result of the Companys adoption of SFAS 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. In 2003, the Company does not expect a theatrical, video or DVD release of a STAR WARS property. As a result, the Company expects royalty and amortization expenses to decrease in 2003 reflecting the anticipated reduction of sales of entertainment based licensed products. Net revenues in the U.S. Toys segment in 2001 decreased to $935,530 from $1,040,893 in 2000. This decline in revenues was primarily the result of decreased sales of POKEMON and FURBY products partially offset by revenues related to the 2001 theatrical worldwide release of JURASSIC PARK III and the U.S. release of MONSTERS, INC., as well as sales from BOB THE BUILDER products. U.S. Toys segment 2001 operating profit was $15,808 an increase from an operating loss of $(151,866) in 2000. This increase, despite the decrease in revenues, was the result of higher gross margin resulting primarily from lower obsolescence charges in 2001, lower royalty expense due to the mix of sales which included increased sales of non licensed products, and cost reductions related to the 2000 consolidation programs and other cost reduction initiatives of the Company. Games Games segment revenues declined 8% in 2002 to $739,782 from 2001 levels of $801,467. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of trading card games, primarily POKEMON, and, to a lesser extent, HARRY POTTER and MAGIC: THE GATHERING, as well as decreased sales of electronic games. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of TRIVIAL PURSUIT resulting from the introduction of the 20th anniversary edition. Games segment operating profit decreased to $124,523 in 2002 from $156,089 in 2001. The decrease in operating profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenues as well as increased product development expenses. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in selling, distribution and administration expenses largely due to the Companys cost reduction initiatives as well as decreased intangible amortization expense resulting from the Companys adoption of SFAS 142, which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives. Games segment revenues for 2001 decreased to $801,467 from 2000 revenues of $1,186,594. This decrease was mainly due to declines in revenues from POKEMON products as well as the impact of the sale of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com business units in January 2001. These decreases were partially offset by increases in MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues as well as sales from products derived from the combination of certain core brands and key licenses, such as the DISNEY edition of MONOPOLY. Operating profit of $156,089 in 2001 increased from $87,992 in 2000. This increase was the result of the sale of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com, which incurred operating losses in 2000. International International segment revenues decreased 3% from 2001 to $970,825 in 2002. Decreases relating to POKEMON and JURASSIC PARK III products were mostly offset by increased sales of STAR WARS products, DISNEY products resulting from the international release of MONSTERS, INC. in 2002, and BEYBLADES products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted International segment revenues by approximately $34,700. International operating profit decreased to $5,177 in 2002 from $28,658 in 2001. Operating profit was negatively 24 impacted by a fine against the Company by the OFT in 2002 for alleged anti competitive pricing practices, which resulted in a charge of $7,566 in the fourth quarter, as well as increased product development expenses as the result of the Companys increased focus on developing its core brands. Increased gross margins were largely offset by higher royalty expenses resulting from increased sales of entertainment based licensed properties, primarily STAR WARS products. Overall, pretax earnings were favorably impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar by approximately $4,700, the result of higher translated U.S. dollar gross margins offset somewhat by higher translated U.S. dollar expenses. International revenues were $996,266 in 2001 compared to $1,451,279 in 2000. This decrease was caused primarily by the decline in sales of POKEMON and FURBY products. International operating profit in 2001 of $28,658 decreased from $129,530 in 2000 primarily as the result of the decrease in sales. Other segments Revenues from the Retail segment, which represents the retail operations of Wizards of the Coast, were $48,983 in 2002 compared with $51,019 in 2001. The operating loss of this segment was $(19,877) in 2002 versus $(36,897) in 2001. The 2001 operating loss includes a charge of approximately $16,000 associated with impairment of long lived assets. Revenues and operating loss in 2001 of $51,019 and $(36,897), respectively, compared with $57,328 and $(10,452), respectively, in 2000. The Company expects that revenues and related expenses of entertainment based products are higher in the year of a theatrical release. Since STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES was released theatrically worldwide in May 2002, the Company expects a decrease in revenues relating to STAR WARS products as well as corresponding decreases in amortization and royalty expense in 2003. The Companys gross profit margin increased in 2002 to 61.0% from 57.2% in 2001, which compares with 55.8% in 2000. The increase in margin primarily reflects product mix, with increased sales of STAR WARS and DISNEY products, partially offset by decreased sales of trading card games. All of these products have higher than average gross margins. The Company has been actively reducing inventory levels during 2001 and 2002, and throughout 2002 has maintained lower levels of inventory to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence. Lower charges relating to obsolescence of inventory also contributed to margin growth from 2000. The Companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items, which could result in higher obsolescence costs in the future. Amortization expense of $94,576 in 2002 compares with amortization of $121,652 in 2001 and $157,763 in 2000. The 2001 and 2000 amortization amounts include $53,655 and $57,286, respectively, of amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles that have been determined to have indefinite lives. As noted above, on December 31, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 142, which requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead, be tested for impairment at least annually. When compared to adjusted amortization from 2001, the resulting increase in amortization expense in 2002 is, for the most part, the result of increased amortization of STAR WARS product rights, which are amortized in accordance with the expected sales curve of related products. Due to the fact that the Company does not expect a STAR WARS theatrical, video or DVD release in 2003, the Company expects amortization expense to decrease in 2003. During 2000, the $157,763 of amortization expense included impairment charges of $25,046 resulting from discontinued product line offerings arising from the Companys decision to focus on developing its core brands. 25 Royalty expense increased to $296,152, or 10.5% of net revenues in 2002 from $209,725 or 7.3% of net revenues in 2001. The increase is primarily related to increased sales of entertainment based product, principally STAR WARS related as the result of the theatrical, video and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES in 2002. 2001 royalties of $209,725 decreased sharply from 2000 royalties of $426,881. Royalties in 2000 included charges of $42,270 relating to royalty commitments on discontinued product lines and product lines with significantly reduced expectations recognized in connection with the Companys consolidation program. Absent these charges in 2000, royalty expenditures were approximately 7.3% and 10.2% of net revenues in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in 2001 from 2000 is the result of decreased sales of licensed products, primarily POKEMON. Revenues derived from entertainment based properties, such as STAR WARS, and resultant royalties, while continuous over the life of a contract, are generally higher in amount in the year a theatrical release takes place. The degree to which revenues, royalties and operating profits fluctuate is dependent not only on theatrical release dates, but video and DVD release dates as well. The Company does not expect a theatrical, video or DVD release of a STAR WARS property in 2003 and, as a result, anticipates that royalty expense will decrease in 2003 as it continues to focus on its core brands. Expenditures for research and product development were $153,775 in 2002 compared to $125,633 in 2001 and $208,485 in 2000. As percentages of net revenues, research and product development was 5.5% in 2002 compared to 4.4% in 2001 and 5.5% in 2000. Absent the impact of costs associated with the business units sold to Infogrames, research and development expense would have been 3.9% in 2000. The increase in 2002 relates to the Companys continued focus on product innovation as part of its strategy to develop its core brands. The decrease in dollars in 2001 from 2000 primarily is the result of the sale of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com business units and, to a lesser extent, the Companys focus on reduced spending and synergies achieved from centralizing the U.S. Toys segment development team into one location. Advertising expense in 2002 increased to $296,549, or 10.5% of net revenues, compared to $290,829 or 10.2% of net revenues in 2001 but decreased from $452,978 or 12.0% of net revenues in 2000. Included in 2000 expense is $3,155 related to contractual commitments on discontinued product lines arising from the Companys 2000 consolidation program. The decrease from 2000 levels results from lower expenditures coinciding with lower revenues, lower media costs and a more efficient use of advertising spending. The Company expects advertising expense to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 as it increases promotion of its core brands. Selling, distribution and administration costs decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2002 to $656,725 or 23.3% of net revenues from $675,482 or 23.6% in 2001. This decrease is primarily due to the Companys cost reduction efforts. Decreases resulting from these cost reduction efforts were partially offset by a charge of $7,566 in 2002 relating to a fine assessed by the OFT against the Company for alleged anti competitive pricing practices. Decreases in 2002 selling, distribution and administration expenses were also partly offset by charges in 2002 for ongoing cost reductions that are expected to benefit the Company in 2003 and thereafter. Selling, distribution and administration costs decreased to $675,482 in 2001 from $863,496 in 2000 but increased as a percentage of net revenues to 23.6% in 2001 from 22.7% in 2000. The increase as a percentage of net revenues was largely due to decreased revenues in 2001. The decrease in dollars is primarily attributable to the business units sold to Infogrames in January 2001 and reductions in marketing, sales and administration expenses related to expense reduction programs. The Company is continuing its focus on reducing expenses in this area in 2003, and does not anticipate an increase in selling, distribution and administration costs in dollars or as a percentage of net revenues in 2003. 26 In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company implemented a plan to consolidate its U.S. Toys group into Rhode Island, significantly reduce overhead through reductions in product development, sales and marketing, and administrative functions across the Company and to increase its focus on development of the Companys core brands. In 2000, the Company recorded a total of $152,270 in expense relating to this plan, $70,079 of restructuring expense and $82,191 of expense in other operating categories, including $6,625 to cost of sales, $25,046 in amortization, $42,270 in royalties, $3,155 in advertising and $5,095 in selling, distribution and administration expense. The significant components of the 2000 plan included the closing of three offices, thereby essentially consolidating the U.S. Toys group in Rhode Island, as well as the reduction of overhead. Overhead reductions were concentrated in marketing and sales, product development and administration, including a curtailment of expansion of the retail business of Wizards of the Coast, the further consolidation of certain international operating offices into regional centers and consolidation and streamlining of the Companys marketing activities. These actions were completed in 2001, and resulted in a restructuring credit of $(1,795), due to lower than expected severance costs necessary to complete the plan. The 2000 plan also included the refocus of the Company on developing and marketing its core brands and reducing its reliance on licensed properties. This focus resulted in product lines which were discontinued or for which the Company has significantly reduced expectations. The components of the plan included in the restructuring charge of $70,100 in the 2000 statement of operations were severance costs of $31,800, lease costs of $21,400 and fixed asset write offs of $16,900. Fixed asset write offs were recorded in 2000. Remaining balances accrued at December 29, 2002 include $500 of severance benefits remaining to be paid to terminated employees over their remaining entitlement period, and $2,600 of lease payments remaining on closed facilities. Total charges under the 2000 plan represented cash charges of approximately $31,800 for severance benefits disbursed over the employees entitlement period, $21,400 for lease costs to be expended over the contractual lease term of the closed facilities and approximately $31,100 of contractual commitments on exited product lines and certain other licensed product lines with reduced expectations due to the Companys enhanced focus on its core brands. The product lines exited were not, either individually or in the aggregate, material to the Companys revenues or operating results. Total non cash charges were $62,900. Non cash charges of $16,900 for fixed asset write offs related primarily to Corporate and the U.S. Toys segment. The remaining approximately $46,000 relates to asset write offs and a write down of assets impaired due to the Companys enhanced focus on its core brands. This also included impairment of intangible assets arising from the decision to discontinue product line offerings. Non cash charges associated with asset write offs were credited to the respective line items on the balance sheet in 2000. While the Company realized benefits from the consolidation of operations and focus on core product lines throughout its income statement, it achieved pretax savings directly related to specific actions under the restructuring plan of $52,000 in 2002. As noted above, in December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain business units comprising Hasbro Interactive, as well as its internet portal, Games.com, to Infogrames for Infogrames securities and cash. The sale of the business units closed in January 2001. Net assets of the business units sold were written down to estimated fair value as of December 31, 2000, resulting in the recognition of a pretax loss of $43,965. During 2001, the Company was engaged in arbitration proceedings with Infogrames regarding a dispute over the amount of post closing adjustments to the sales proceeds in connection with this sale. The dispute was settled with no material adjustments to the Companys results of operations. Proceeds from the sale were $56,200, of which $1,000 was in cash, $1,000 was in redeemable preferred stock of Hasbro Interactive and the remainder was in common stock of Infogrames. During 2002, the 27 Company recognized charges relating to the other than temporary decline in the value of this common stock, which is detailed further below. Interest expense decreased to $77,499 in 2002 from $103,688 in 2001 and $114,421 in 2000. Approximately 53% of the decrease in 2002 as compared to 2001 is due to decreased average borrowing rates, predominantly the result of the issuance of $250,000 of 2.75% convertible senior debentures in November 2001, the proceeds of which were used to repurchase debt with higher interest rates. Also contributing to the decreased average rates in 2002 were several interest rate swap agreements initiated in the second quarter of 2002 to adjust the amount of the Companys total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates. The remainder of the decrease in interest is due to decreased average borrowings in 2002, primarily reflecting decreased short term borrowings in 2002 as well as the repurchase of $124,585 in principal amount of 7.95% Notes due March 2003 during the last three quarters of 2002. The decrease in 2001 from 2000 is due primarily to decreased short term borrowings. At December 29, 2002, $200,288 in principal amount of the 7.95% Notes due March 2003 remained outstanding. In March 2003, the Company repaid these notes. As a result, the Company expects interest expense to continue to decrease in 2003. Other expense of $37,704 in 2002 compares to other expense of $11,443 in 2001 and $7,288 in 2000. The 2002 amount includes a $42,902 write down of the value of the common stock of Infogrames Entertainment SA, held by the Company as an available for sale investment. This charge was partially offset by interest income on a tax settlement of $10,211 received in the second quarter of 2002. The 2001 amount reflects a lower level of interest income coupled with an increase in losses on foreign currency transactions, including the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation. Expense in 2000 relates primarily to the write down of investments held for sale which have experienced an other than temporary decline in value, coupled with a higher level of transactional losses resulting from an unfavorable movement in foreign currency. Income tax expense was 27.9% of pretax earnings in 2002 compared with 36.8% in 2001. Absent the effect of the OFT penalty, the 2002 tax rate would have been 26%. Income tax benefit on the 2000 pretax loss was 36.0%. The decrease in 2002 from 2001 is primarily due to the adoption of SFAS 142, which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have an indefinite life. The increase in 2001 from 2000 reflects the tax impact of operating losses in jurisdictions where benefits were not realizable. On December 31, 2001, the first day of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill, as well as amortization of intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life. Under this statement, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to applicable reporting units. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually. The impairment test for goodwill uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of fair value of a reporting unit. The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Completion of step one identified that the U.S. Toys reporting unit had a fair value which was less than its carrying value, indicating a need for a step two analysis. No other reporting units required step two procedures. After allocating the fair value of the U.S. Toys reporting unit to its assets and liabilities, the remaining value was insufficient to cover goodwill by $296,223. Goodwill of the U.S. Toys reporting unit was impaired by this amount. This impairment is included in results for 2002, net of related tax impact of $50,491. The Company performed its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and no impairment was indicated. 28  During 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" which required that the Company record all derivatives, such as foreign exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the derivative fair values that are designated, effective and qualify as cash flow hedges, are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (AOCE) until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of adopting Statement 133, and in accordance with the transition provisions, the Company recorded a one time after tax charge of $1,066 during 2001 representing the cumulative effect of the adoption in its consolidated statements of operations and an after tax unrealized loss of $753 to AOCE, which the Company reclassified to earnings in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Hasbro has historically generated a significant amount of cash from normal operations. Seasonal financing requirements have been met with the use of short term borrowings, which in 2002 and 2001 included borrowings under a secured committed line of credit, and in 2000, issuance of commercial paper as well as borrowings under the Companys lines of credit. Long term debt has increased from nil in 1997, to $857,274, excluding current installments, at December 29, 2002. This long term debt has been used primarily to fund the Companys 1998 and 1999 business acquisitions, as well as the repurchase of the Companys common stock in the open market. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses or repurchases of its common stock in 2002 or 2001. At December 29, 2002, cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings, were $474,321. This compares with cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings of $199,071 and $(99,177) at December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. Hasbro generated approximately $473,000, $372,000 and $163,000 of net cash from its operating activities in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 from 2001 results primarily from the Companys continued aggressive management of its cash flow requirements. Cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by the Companys cost reduction initiatives in both 2002 and 2001 which resulted in a lower level of operating expenses, and as a result, lower levels of prepaid expenses and accrued expenses. The Company used a significant part of its cash from operations in 2001 to reduce the levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Despite fourth quarter 2002 revenues increasing from 2001 levels, fourth quarter days sales outstanding improved to 50 days from 52 days in 2001 and 53 days in 2000. Accounts receivable at year end is primarily composed of fourth quarter revenues. Improved inventory management resulted in inventory levels approximately $27,000, or 13% lower at December 2002 than December 2001. 2001 inventory levels were significantly reduced by $118,000 or 35% from 2000. Increased sales of entertainment based licensed products, primarily STAR WARS products, in 2002 resulted in a decrease in prepaid royalties from 2001, net of a $120,000 payment made in 2002 relating to the STAR WARS license. In comparing 2001 with 2000, the significant increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to the improved management of accounts receivable and inventory, as well as efforts at cost reduction that resulted in reduced prepaid expenses, offset somewhat by corresponding reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2001 versus 2000. Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $62,314, $57,779 and $180,710 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2002, the Company expended approximately $59,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment while during 2001 and 2000 it expended approximately $50,000 and $125,000, respectively. Of these amounts, 64% in 2002, 75% in 2001 and 33% in 2000 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. Under the terms of the Companys credit facility, the Company is restricted in the amount it can expend on additions to property, plant and equipment. As part of its cash management process, 29 the Company further reduced its level of spending on property, plant and equipment in 2002 and 2001 below the level it was permitted under its outstanding credit facilities. In 2003, the Company expects capital expenditures to increase from the 2002 and 2001 levels. Based on underlying changes in the way the Company does business, the Company does not expect to return to capital expenditure levels of 2000. During the three years ended December 29, 2002, depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was $89,262, $104,247 and $106,458, respectively. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2002 or 2001. In 2002, the Company made payments of $7,419 relating to a settlement of a dispute with the former shareholders of Wizards of the Coast. During 2000, the Company made several small acquisitions for approximately $58,000 in total, net of cash acquired, none of which were considered individually significant. Additionally, 2000 investing activities included post closing adjustments and contingent payments in relation to the September 1999 acquisition of Wizards. Other investing activities in 2000 largely reflect a reduction in intangible and other long term assets of Hasbro Interactive and Games.com, which were sold to Infogrames. Under the terms of the Companys credit facility, the Company is restricted in the amount it can expend on future acquisitions. The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected makes it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2002 and 2001, the Company utilized cash from operations and borrowing under its secured amended and restated revolving credit and line of credit agreements to meet its cash flow requirements. At December 29, 2002, the Company had a committed secured revolving credit agreement of $380,000, maturing in March 2005. The facility is secured by substantially all domestic accounts receivable and inventory, as well as certain intangible assets of the Company. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement. The agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number of other limitations, including with respect to capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants throughout the fiscal year ended December 29, 2002. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed facility at March 2, 2003. Amounts available and unused under uncommitted lines at March 2, 2003 were approximately $55,000. During 2000, the Company borrowed through the issuance of commercial paper and against short term lines of credit to fund its seasonal working capital requirements in excess of funds available from operations and the issuance of long term debt. The Company funds its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, as well as utilizing borrowings under the Companys secured and unsecured credit facilities when needed. During 2003, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs through cash flows from operations and utilization of its revolving credit facility and believes that the funds available to it are adequate to meet its needs. The Company expects to be in compliance with its covenants in 2003. However, unforeseen circumstances, such as severe softness in, or a collapse of, the retail environment may result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results of the Company, thereby causing the Company to be in non compliance with its debt covenants. This may cause the Company to be unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility, a circumstance most likely to occur when operating shortfalls would result in the Company being in greatest need of such supplementary borrowings. 30 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $159,337 in 2002. This was primarily the result of the Companys use of cash flows from operations to repurchase $124,585 and $2,385 in principal amount of 7.95% Notes due in March 2003 and 5.60% Notes due in 2005, respectively. At December 29, 2002, the Company had $200,288 in principal amount remaining of 7.95% Notes due in March 2003, which are included as current installments of long term debt at December 29, 2002. These 7.95% Notes due in March 2003 were repaid using cash from operations. In November and December of 2001, the Company issued $250,000 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The proceeds from the sales along with cash on hand were used to repurchase $250,000 in original principal amount of existing long term debt, specifically $225,000 of the 7.95% notes due 2003, $4,000 of the 6.15% notes due 2008, and $21,000 of the 6.60% notes due 2028. Cash on hand was used to repurchase an additional $124,585 of principal amount of the notes due in 2003 and $2,385 of principal amount of the 5.60% Notes due in 2005. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, commencing in December 2005 depending on the price of the Companys stock. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument which is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, and changes in fair value will be recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds certain levels for a specified period of time, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2005, December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. The Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised. In January 2003, the Company amended its license with Lucas Licensing Ltd. ("Lucas") for the manufacture and distribution of STAR WARS toys and games. Under the amended agreement the term was extended by ten years and is expected to run through 2018. In addition, the minimum guaranteed royalties due to Lucas were reduced by $85,000. In a separate agreement, the warrants previously granted to Lucas were also amended. Under this warrant amendment, the term of each of the warrants issued to Lucas was extended by ten years. The warrant amendment agreement provides the Company with an option through October 2016 to purchase all of these warrants from Lucas for a price to be paid at the Companys election of either $200 million in cash or $220 million in the Companys common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. Also, the warrant amendment agreement provides Lucas with an option through January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to the Company for a price to be paid at the Companys election of either $100 million in cash or $110 million in Hasbro common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. Should either the put or call be required to be settled, the Company believes that it will have adequate funds to settle this in cash if necessary. This warrant amendment agreement was not included in the computation of earnings per share at December 29, 2002. Had this agreement been included in the earnings per share calculation at December 29, 2002, diluted earnings per share prior to cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal 2002 would have been $.41. Cash utilized by financing activities in 2001 was $202,661. This was principally the result of net repayments of short term borrowings of $190,216 as the result of the Companys focus on reducing debt, a practice that was continued in 2002. During 2000, net financing activities utilized approximately $128,000 of funds of the Company, primarily as a result of the completion on March 27 of a "Modified Dutch Auction" tender offer, pursuant to which the Company accepted for payment 18,086 shares of common stock, representing approximately 9.5% of outstanding shares, at a purchase price of $17.25 per share. The aggregate purchase, including fees and expenses associated with the tender offer, was approximately $313,000. Offsetting this utilization were net 31 borrowing activities in 2000 which included the issuance of $550,000 of 7.95% notes due March 15, 2003 and $200,000 of 8.50% notes due March 15, 2006. On December 6, 1999, the Board authorized a common stock repurchase program up to $500,000. A portion of this authorization was used in 2000 in connection with the repurchase of shares through the Modified Dutch Auction discussed above. At December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, $204,500 remains available under the 1999 authorization. Shares acquired under the Board authorization are being used for corporate purposes including issuance upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. Under terms of the Companys revolving credit agreement, share repurchases, purchasing long term debt prior to maturity, and payment of dividends in excess of $.03 per share per quarter or 25% of prior year consolidated net income, which ever is greater, are restricted payments which are capped at $15,000 per fiscal year. Repurchases of the 7.95% Notes due March 2003 were subject to separate restrictions. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions. Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue from product sales when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of title to the customer, at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the Company underproducing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard. On December 31, 2001, the first day of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which eliminates the amortization of goodwill, as well as amortization of intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life. Under this Statement, goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to applicable reporting units. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually. Goodwill is tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. The first step is a 32 screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the income approach. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $245,732, net of tax, primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and no impairment was indicated. At December 29, 2002, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $536,731 recorded on the balance sheet. Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows. The preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $636,408 at December 29, 2002. The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 29, 2002, the Company had $203,500 of prepaid royalties, $42,500 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $161,000 which are included in other assets. The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets, expected salary increases, and applicable discount rates. The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information and, in light of recent decreases in historical average market returns, the Company reduced its expected return on plan assets in 2002 to 8.75% versus 9.00% used in 2001 and 2000. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. Expected salary increases are estimated using a combination of historical salary increases with expected salary increases in the Companys long term business forecasts. Based on this analysis, the Company reduced expected salary increases in 2002 to 4.0% from 4.5% used in 2001 and 2000. Increases in estimated salary increases would increase pension expense while decreases 33 would decrease pension expense. Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company considers Moodys long term Aa Corporate Bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate. At September 30, 2002, the Companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities, the Moodys long term Corporate Bond yield was 6.51%, and the Company selected a discount rate of 6.50%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. Primarily as the result of the changes in these assumptions, the Company expects its pension expense in 2003 to increase by approximately $4,500. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions", actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if in excess of a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. Assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. In 2002, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $44,811. This amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. The Company does not expect the changes in assumptions to impact its funding requirements in 2003. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,042,856 of long term debt, including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments, outstanding at December 29, 2002. Future payments required under these and other obligations are as follows: Payments due by Fiscal Year Certain Contractual Obligations 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Long term debt, including current installments $ 201,841 1,119 98,780 201,213 1,263 538,640 1,042,856 Operating lease commitments 38,342 30,315 24,722 18,170 15,294 27,488 154,331 Future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments 91,000 68,000 97,000 16,000 12,000 25,000 309,000 Purchase commitments 18,850 18,850 $ 350,033 99,434 220,502 235,383 28,557 591,128 1,525,037 Certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon theatrical release of the related entertainment property. In additional to the contractual obligations noted above, the Company has letters of credit of approximately $38,000 at December 29, 2002. Financial Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the most part as the result of sourcing products in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than thirty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Hong 34 Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies, including those in Latin American countries. To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its estimated upcoming fiscal year foreign currency transactions, first and foremost by using forward foreign exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, zero cost option collars. From time to time, the Company may also hedge foreign currency exposure using purchased foreign currency options. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% unfavorable movement in the U.S. dollar could result in an approximate $7.0 million decrease in the fair value of these instruments. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Company does not speculate in, and, other than set forth above, the Company does not hedge foreign currencies. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At December 29, 2002, the Company had fixed rate long term debt, including current installments, of $1,059,115. The Company entered into several interest rate swap agreements in 2002, with a total notional amount of $350,000, to adjust the amount of long term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt obligations. These interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges of the underlying debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately $68,000 or $59,000, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2003 pre tax earnings and cash flows by $1,671 and $1,015, respectively. The Economy and Inflation The Company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2002. The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 52% and 48% of its consolidated net revenues in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In the past year certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate. The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year being more significant to its overall business. The trend of retailers over the past few years has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues. The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2002 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly. 35 Other Information During 2001, the Company received two inquiries from the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom (the "OFT") into allegedly anti competitive pricing practices by the Companys United Kingdom subsidiary, Hasbro U.K. Ltd. ("Hasbro U.K."). The first of the inquiries (the "wholesaler case"), begun in May of 2001, related to Hasbro U.K.s interactions with certain of its wholesale distributors. The second inquiry (the "retailer case"), begun in August of 2001, related to Hasbro U.K.s trading arrangements with certain of its direct retail accounts. On November 29, 2002, the OFT issued a decision in the wholesaler case, finding that Hasbro U.K. had entered into agreements with certain distributors to fix prices in violation of U.K. competition laws. The OFT assessed a fine in that case of approximately GBP 4,950 or approximately $7,900 at the then current exchange rates. The Company filed an appeal of this decision in January 2003 to the U.K. Competition Commission Appeals Tribunal (the "CCAT"). On February 19, 2003, the OFT issued a decision in the retailer case, finding that Hasbro U.K. had entered into agreements with certain direct retailers to fix prices in violation of U.K. competition laws. The OFT assessed a fine in this case but, due to the Companys cooperation in the OFTs investigation, the OFTs decision stated that the Company would not be required to pay any of that fine. Before receiving the OFTs decisions in the wholesaler and retailer cases, the Company had disclosed an estimated range of aggregate loss for the two cases of approximately GBP 160 to GBP 26,000. Because a number of factors, including the lack of precedent under the applicable U.K. statute and the significant appeal rights available to the Company in the event of a final adverse determination by the OFT, the Company previously determined that there was no amount within this range which was a better estimate than any other amount in the range. As such, in accordance with applicable accounting requirements, the Company previously accrued a charge to earnings equal to the low end of this range, or GBP 160 in 2001. In light of the OFTs decision in the wholesaler case, the Company determined that the amount of GBP 4,947 was the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss from that case. To reflect this determination, the Company accrued an additional charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 of GBP 4,787 or $7,566, at applicable exchange rates, related to this liability. This resulted in a total amount accrued at December 29, 2002 of GBP 4,947 or $7,935 at year end exchange rates. On March 3, 2003, the Company withdrew its appeal of the wholesaler case with the CCAT. In light of the OFTs decision in the retailer case, no charge will be recorded in connection with that case. The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" (SFAS 146), which addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. SFAS 146 nullifies Emerging Issue Task Force Issue 94 3. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company expects to adopt the provisions of this statement at the beginning of fiscal 2003 and does not expect that the adoption will result in a material impact to its consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123" (SFAS 148), which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as well as 36 amending the disclosure requirements of Statement 123. While the Company currently plans to retain the intrinsic value provisions of APB 25, the Company adopted portions of the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 in its financial statements as of and for the year ended December 29, 2002. The remaining provisions of SFAS 148 will not effect the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. ITEM 7A.
