Most of the Companys products are either internally developed or licensed from outside inventors. In addition to the products based on its own core brands, the Company also offers internally developed products tied to licensed theatrical and television based entertainment properties, such as STAR WARS and DISNEY movies. The Companys principal business strategies focus on: Growing its core brands, Developing new and innovative toy and game products, and Increasing operating margins by optimizing efficiencies within the Company. Management views the Companys principal product opportunities as falling into three general categories: core brands, innovative new products and entertainment based products. Although the Company intends to continue to offer products based on licensed entertainment properties, in the 23 past three years the Company has actively sought to reduce its reliance on products based on these entertainment properties and to achieve more consistent performance by focusing greater resources on the development and growth of its core brands and on producing innovative products which are not based on movie properties. The Companys core brands represent Company owned or Company controlled brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL and TONKA, which the Company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth. However, the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the long term success of existing product lines and consistently introduce successful new products. In addition to its focus on core brands, the Companys strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities. In 2003, the success of innovative products such as BEYBLADE, FURREAL FRIENDS, and VIDEONOW contributed significantly to the Companys success. Although BEYBLADE products accounted for approximately 11% of the Companys consolidated net revenues in 2003, the Company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify opportunistic new products will prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any one product line. While the Companys strategy focuses on growing its core brands and the development of innovative, new products, the Company continues to evaluate and enter into strategic arrangements to license entertainment based properties when the Company believes it is economically beneficial. Entertainment based licenses in 2003 included DISNEY and STAR WARS. Revenues in 2002 were positively impacted by increased shipments of STAR WARS products as a result of the release of STAR WARS: EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES, theatrically in May of 2002 and on DVD and video in November of 2002. Although gross profits of entertainment based products are generally higher, this increased gross margin is offset by royalty expenses incurred on these sales, as well as amortization expense of property rights paid to the licensor of such properties. In recent years, the Company has also focused on reducing its fixed costs and increasing its operating margins. In 2003, the Company continued this focus with a number of business efficiency initiatives. Two of these initiatives were the cessation of manufacturing at the Companys Valencia, Spain facility and the announced closure of the remaining retail stores operated under the Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper names. The Company continues to review its operations in order to determine areas where greater efficiency can be achieved. The Companys strategy for the near term also focuses on the reduction of long term debt. The goal of management is to reduce the Companys debt to capitalization ratio, defined as total debt, both short term and long term, as a percentage of total equity plus total debt, to 25 30% over the medium term. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company initiated a tender offer, pursuant to which the Company repurchased $167,257 of aggregate principal amount of the 8.50% notes due 2006 previously issued by the Company. In addition, in the first quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased or repaid $200,288, in principal amount, of 7.95% notes due in March 2003. At December 28, 2003, the Companys debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 34%, which compared to approximately 48% at December 29, 2002. 2003 was a year of continuing consolidation in the toy and game industry, with further store closings and the bankruptcy of two notable toy and game retailers. As a result, the Companys customer base continues to become more concentrated. While the consolidation of customers may provide certain benefits to the Company, such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution, this consolidation also creates additional risks to 24 the Companys business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with the Company. In addition, increased customer concentration may decrease the prices the Company is able to obtain for some of its products. The Company believes that its strategy of seeking to produce sought after products, which provide value to both consumers and the Companys customers, will help protect the Company from any negative impact resulting from an environment of increasing retail consolidation. Results of Operations Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003 were $157,664, or $.88 per diluted share. Net earnings (loss) for fiscal 2002 and 2001 were $(170,674) and $59,732, or $(.98) and $.35 per diluted share, respectively. Included in net earnings for 2003 is a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $(17,351), or $(.10) per diluted share, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). Subsequent to the adoption of this statement, which requires the Company to adjust certain warrants to their fair value through earnings, the Company incurred a non cash charge of $13,630 relating to the increase in fair value of these warrants. Net earnings in 2003 also included the impact of debt reduction activities and charges associated with the business efficiency activities of the Company, two of which were noted above. Associated cash charges in 2003 include a loss on the extinguishment of debt, net of taxes, of $12,612 relating to the repurchase of the Companys debt mentioned above. Additionally, 2003 net earnings include cash charges, net of taxes, of $20,684 relating to severance and lease costs associated with the cessation of manufacturing at the Companys facility in Valencia, Spain and the disposition of substantially all of the Companys remaining retail stores. Included in the net loss for 2002 is a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $(245,732), or $(1.42) per diluted share, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). The 2002 net loss also includes a non cash charge, net of tax, of $31,747 for the write down of the Companys investment in Infogrames Entertainment S.A. ("Infogrames") common stock. In addition, the 2002 net loss includes a charge of $7,566 relating to a fine imposed on the Companys United Kingdom affiliate by the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom ("OFT") for alleged anti competitive pricing practices. The 2002 net loss was favorably impacted by the provisions of SFAS 142 that eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives. The elimination of this amortization and its related tax effect had SFAS 142 been applied in 2001 would have increased net earnings by $45,013. Also favorably impacting the 2002 net loss was interest income, net of tax, of $7,556, received on an IRS tax settlement. Included in net earnings for 2001 is a $1,066 net of tax charge relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities." Costs incurred in the Companys International segment relating to the deteriorating Argentine business environment and the devaluation of the peso amounted to $11,290, net of tax, in 2001. Approximately half of this charge relates to the impact of the devaluation on U.S. dollar denominated intercompany liabilities the Company held in Argentina. Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 28, 2003 were $3,138,657 compared to $2,816,230 in 2002 and $2,856,339 in 2001. Most of the Companys revenues and operating profit result from its three principal segments: U.S. Toys, Games and International, which are discussed in detail below. 25 U.S. Toys Net revenues in the U.S. Toys segment increased by 6% in 2003 over 2002 to $1,057,984. The increase is due primarily to strong sales of BEYBLADE and FURREAL FRIENDS products, which were introduced in the second half of 2002. In addition, revenue from sales of VIDEONOW, which was introduced in 2003, and MY LITTLE PONY, which was reintroduced in 2003, contributed to the increase in revenues. Revenues were also positively impacted by increased shipments of products related to certain core brands, such as TRANSFORMERS and PLAYSKOOL products. Sales of DISNEY products also increased as a result of the theatrical, video and DVD releases of FINDING NEMO and the DVD and video re releases of THE LION KING in 2003. These increases were partially offset by the expected decrease in sales of STAR WARS products in a non movie year, as well as decreased sales of BOB THE BUILDER, E KARA, and ZOIDS products. U.S. Toys operating profit for the year ended December 28, 2003 was $91,996 compared with $75,664 in the prior year. The increase in operating profit was largely due to lower royalty and amortization expenses as the result of lower sales of entertainment based products, primarily STAR WARS related products. STAR WARS property rights are amortized in proportion to expected remaining sales. In periods with higher sales of STAR WARS products, such as 2002, the resulting amortization expense will be higher. The decreases in royalty and amortization expense were partially offset by decreased gross profits due to a change in product mix. Although revenues increased in 2003, the 2002 product mix included higher sales of STAR WARS products, which have higher gross margins, while the 2003 product mix included increased sales of lower gross margin products, resulting in an overall decrease in gross profits. Operating profit in 2003 was also impacted by higher advertising expense reflecting the Companys increased focus on marketing to raise awareness of its core brands and to launch new products. Net revenues in the U.S. Toys segment increased by 7% in 2002 over 2001 to $996,496. The increase was due primarily to higher revenues from STAR WARS products. In addition, revenues were positively impacted by increased shipments of products related to certain core brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS and PLAYSKOOL products, as well as the introduction of BEYBLADE products. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of electronic interactive products, such as B.I.O. BUGS and POO CHI, remote control toys and, to a lesser extent, POKEMON products and E KARA. In addition, 2001 sales were favorably affected by the theatrical and video releases of JURASSIC PARK III and DISNEYS MONSTERS, INC. in that year. U.S. Toys operating profit for the year ended December 29, 2002 was $75,664 compared with $15,808 in the prior year. The increase in operating profit was largely due to higher gross margins resulting from the mix of products sold in 2002 versus 2001, primarily STAR WARS products, which carry a higher gross margin. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased royalty expense resulting from higher sales of licensed products in 2002, again primarily STAR WARS products. In addition to this, operating profit was positively impacted by lower sales and administration costs in 2002 as a result of the Companys focus on cost reduction and more effective management, resulting largely from the consolidation of the U.S. Toys segment into essentially one location, a process begun in 2000. Higher amortization expense in 2002 relating to the product rights associated with STAR WARS was offset by the elimination of amortization of goodwill and product rights deemed to have an indefinite life as the result of the Companys adoption of SFAS 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Games Games segment revenues increased 9% in 2003 to $804,547 from 2002 levels of $739,782. The increase primarily relates to continued strong shipments of TRIVIAL PURSUIT 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, which was initially released in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2002, as well as shipments 26 of TRIVIAL PURSUIT POP CULTURE DVD game, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2003; increased shipments of TWISTER products which include TWISTER MOVES; continued strong sales of MONOPOLY brand products; and increased revenues from shipments of other core brands, primarily MAGIC: THE GATHERING products, as well as higher revenues from other non licensed trading card games. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of licensed trading card games including POKEMON and HARRY POTTER. Games segment operating profit increased to $175,295 in 2003 from $124,523 in 2002. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased gross profit from higher revenues, as well as lower royalty expense, resulting from decreased sales of licensed trading card games. These factors were partially offset by an increase in advertising expense due to the Companys strategy to increase advertising focused on increasing demand for its core brands. Operating profit for 2003 also benefited from decreased fixed expenses as the result of cost reduction initiatives. Games segment revenues declined 8% in 2002 to $739,782 from 2001 levels of $801,467. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of trading card games, primarily POKEMON, and, to a lesser extent, HARRY POTTER and MAGIC: THE GATHERING, as well as decreased sales of electronic games. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of TRIVIAL PURSUIT resulting from the introduction of the 20th anniversary edition. Games segment operating profit decreased to $124,523 in 2002 from $156,089 in 2001. The decrease in operating profit was primarily due to the decrease in revenues as well as increased product development expenses. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in selling, distribution and administration expenses largely due to the Companys cost reduction initiatives as well as decreased intangible amortization expense resulting from the Companys adoption of SFAS 142. International International segment revenues increased 22% in 2003 compared to 2002 to $1,184,532. Revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $127,900 as the result of the weaker U.S. dollar. This foreign exchange impact accounted for 13% of the percentage increase in net segment revenues for 2003. Local currency revenue increases for 2003 were primarily a result of revenues from BEYBLADE products and to a lesser extent, FURREAL FRIENDS products, which were introduced in most markets in the fourth quarter of 2002. Revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of core brand products, including MY LITTLE PONY, as well as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TRANSFORMERS, MONOPOLY and PLAYSKOOL products. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from STAR WARS products, decreases in sales of licensed trading card games including HARRY POTTER and POKEMON, and decreased sales of E KARA products. International operating profit increased to $91,273 in 2003 from $5,177 in 2002. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenues, partially offset by increased advertising expense. The expected decrease in royalty expense relating to lower sales of STAR WARS products was largely offset by increased royalty expense associated with higher sales of BEYBLADE products and the foreign exchange impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Selling, distribution and administration costs decreased as a percentage of sales, but increased in amount, largely due to the foreign exchange impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Gross profit and operating profit were also negatively impacted by the Companys decision to cease its manufacturing operations in Spain. The most significant components related to this action were cash charges of approximately $18,400 associated with severance. However, this move is expected to result in future cost savings to the Company. Although revenues were positively impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar, as noted above, operating expenses were also impacted, with a resulting net positive 27 translation impact to International operating profit of approximately $6,500 for 2003. Operating profit in 2002 was negatively impacted by a fine against the Company by the OFT for alleged anti competitive pricing practices, which resulted in a charge of $7,566 in the fourth quarter. International segment revenues decreased 3% in 2002 to $970,825 compared to 2001. While revenues decreased from 2001, International segment revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $34,700 as the result of the weaker U.S. dollar. Decreases relating to POKEMON and JURASSIC PARK III products were mostly offset by increased sales of STAR WARS products, DISNEY products resulting from the international release of MONSTERS, INC. in 2002, and BEYBLADE products. International operating profit decreased to $5,177 in 2002 from $28,658 in 2001. As noted above, operating profit was negatively impacted by a fine against the Company by the OFT in 2002 of $7,566. Operating profit was also negatively impacted by increased product development expenses as the result of the Companys increased focus on developing its core brands. Increased gross margins were largely offset by higher royalty expenses resulting from increased sales of entertainment based licensed properties, primarily STAR WARS products. Although revenues were positively impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar, as noted above, operating expenses were also impacted, with a resulting net positive translation impact to International operating profit of approximately $4,700 for 2002. Other Segments Revenues from the Retail segment, which represents the retail operations of Wizards of the Coast, were $37,707 in 2003, compared with $48,983 in 2002 and $51,019 in 2001. The operating loss of this segment was $(34,604) in 2003 versus $(19,877) in 2002, and $(36,897) in 2001. In December 2003, the Company announced the closure of all of its remaining Wizards of the Coast and Game Keeper stores. Included in the segments 2003 operating loss is a charge related to this action, the most significant components of which were cash charges related to leases and severance of approximately $14,000. The retail stores provided the Company with a direct to consumer sales channel for Wizards of the Coast and other Hasbro products. The Company expects that revenues for Company products which used to be sold in these retail stores will continue through other sales channels. The Games segment plans to increase certain advertising and marketing initiatives to sustain the benefits that the retail stores provided to its product lines in the past. While the Company will have continuing revenue and certain costs associated with the sales of products which used to be sold in the retail stores in its future operations, it did not consider operating retail stores core to its business and believes the elimination of these stores will decrease costs to the Company and improve business efficiencies. The 2001 operating loss includes a charge of approximately $16,000 associated with impairment of long lived assets. Gross Profit The Companys gross profit margin decreased in 2003 to 59.0% from 61.0% in 2002, which compares with 57.2% in 2001. The decrease from 2002 primarily reflects a change in mix of products sold, with decreased sales of STAR WARS products in 2003 over 2002. The increase in gross margin from 2001 to 2002 also reflects this mix of products sold, with increased sales of STAR WARS and DISNEY products partially offset by decreased sales of trading card games. All of these products have higher gross margins. In addition to the mix of products sold, the decrease from 2002 gross margin levels also reflects 2003 charges incurred by the Company to cease manufacturing operations in Spain, comprised primarily of severance costs as well as non cash charges associated with fixed assets. The production activities previously performed in Spain will be transferred to the Companys other manufacturing facilities or outsourced to third party suppliers. The Company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory, attempting to avoid unnecessary 28 expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence. The Companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items, which could result in higher obsolescence costs, causing a reduction in gross profit. Expenses Amortization expense decreased to $76,053 or 2.4% of net revenues in 2003, compared with amortization of $94,576 or 3.4% of net revenues in 2002 and $121,652 or 4.3% of net revenues in 2001. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 is primarily related to decreased amortization of the property rights related to STAR WARS. The STAR WARS property rights are amortized in proportion to expected remaining sales. In periods with higher sales of STAR WARS products, such as 2002, the resulting amortization expense will be higher. Comparing 2002 to 2001, the 2001 amortization amount includes $53,655 of amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles that were determined to have indefinite lives when the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 142 on December 31, 2001. Such intangibles and goodwill are no longer amortized and they are tested for impairment at least annually. When compared to adjusted amortization from 2001, the resulting increase in amortization expense in 2002 was, for the most part, the result of increased amortization of STAR WARS property rights. Royalty expense decreased to $248,423, or 7.9% of net revenues in 2003 from $296,152, or 10.5% of net revenues in 2002. The decrease primarily relates to lower sales of STAR WARS related products. This decrease was in accordance with the Companys expectations as the Company continues to focus on its core brands, and there was no theatrical, video, or DVD release of a STAR WARS property in 2003. The decrease in royalty expense as a result of STAR WARS was partially offset by increased royalty expense related to BEYBLADE products and the foreign exchange impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Royalty expense increased to $296,152, or 10.5% of net revenues in 2002 from $209,725 or 7.3% of net revenues in 2001. The increase was primarily related to increased sales of entertainment based product, principally STAR WARS related. Revenues derived from entertainment based properties, such as STAR WARS, and resultant royalties, while continuous over the life of a contract, are generally higher in amount in the year a theatrical release takes place. The degree to which revenues, royalties and operating profits fluctuate is dependent not only on theatrical release dates, but video and DVD release dates as well. In 2004, the Company has licensing rights to two major theatrical releases, DISNEY/PIXARS THE INCREDIBLES, expected to be released in the spring, and DREAMWORKS SHREK 2, expected to be released in the summer. Expenditures for research and product development were $143,183 in 2003 compared to $153,775 in 2002 and $125,633 in 2001. As percentages of net revenues, research and product development was 4.6% in 2003 compared to 5.5% in 2002 and 4.4% in 2001. Investment in research and product development costs is an important component to the Companys strategy to grow core brands and to create new and innovative toy and game products. The decrease in 2003 was primarily the result of more efficient and cost effective processes for design and engineering. The increase from 2001 to 2002 related to the Companys continued focus on product innovation as part of its strategy to develop its core brands. The Company expects research and product development expenses to remain consistent with 2003 levels as a percentage of sales in 2004. Advertising expense in 2003 increased to $363,876, or 11.6% of net revenues, compared to $296,549 or 10.5% of net revenues in 2002 and $290,829 or 10.2% of net revenues in 2001. The increases reflect the Companys greater focus on marketing to increase and maintain awareness of its core brands, as well as to introduce new products. The Company expects 2004 expense to increase in dollars and as a percentage of sales as it continues to follow this strategy of focusing on core brands and offering new innovative products. 29 Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars, but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2003 to $674,544 or 21.5% of net revenues from $656,725 or 23.3% of net revenues in 2002. The costs decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2002 from the 2001 costs of $673,687 or 23.6% of net revenues. The increase in dollars in 2003 partially reflects charges relating to the Companys announced closure of its remaining retail stores operated under the Wizards of the Coast and Game Keeper names. The increased expenses were also the result of higher distribution expenses due to increased sales volume, higher international expenses in translated U.S. dollars as the result of the weaker U.S. dollar, and increased management bonus provisions as the result of the Companys improved financial performance. These increases offset decreases in certain other expenses resulting from the Companys ongoing cost reduction efforts as part of its strategy to make its business more efficient. The decrease from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to the Companys cost reduction efforts, partially offset by a charge of $7,566 in 2002 relating to a fine assessed by the OFT against the Company for alleged anti competitive pricing practices. The Company is continuing its focus on reducing selling, distribution and administration expenses, and anticipates that these costs as a percentage of net revenues will continue to decline in 2004. Nonoperating Expense Other expense, net, of $48,090 in 2003 compares to other expense, net, of $37,704 in 2002 and $11,443 in 2001. The 2003 amount includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of $20,342 relating to the 8.50% Notes due 2006, repurchased pursuant to a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2003. Under the tender offer, the Company repurchased notes totaling $167,257 in aggregate principal amount. Nonoperating expense in 2003 also includes a non cash charge of $13,630 related to the increase in the fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability under the provisions of SFAS 150. As a result of adopting this new accounting standard, these warrants are now required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. The fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by the stock price of the Company at the date of measurement, but is also affected by the Companys stock price volatility over time as well as risk free interest rates. Assuming the Companys stock volatility and risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants will increase and the Company will recognize a charge to earnings if the price of the Companys stock increases. If the price of the Companys stock decreases and the Companys stock volatility and risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants will decrease and the Company will recognize income. Based on a hypothetical increase in the Companys stock price to $25.00 per share at December 28, 2003 from its actual price of $21.22 a share on that date, the Company would have recognized an additional non cash charge to earnings of approximately $16,650 to adjust the warrants to their fair value. Nonoperating expense for 2002 includes a $42,902 write down of the value of the common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company as an available for sale investment. This charge was partially offset by interest income on a tax settlement of $10,211 received in the second quarter of 2002. The 2001 amount primarily reflects losses on foreign currency transactions, including the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation. Interest expense decreased to $52,462 in 2003 from $77,499 in 2002 and $103,688 in 2001. Approximately 52% of the decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002 is attributable to lower levels of short term and long term debt. This mainly reflects the repurchase and repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2003 when the Company repurchased or repaid $200,288, in principal amount, of 7.95% Notes, due in March 2003, using cash from operations. In the fourth quarter of 2003, as noted above, the Company repurchased $167,257 in principal amount of 8.50% Notes due 2006, in conjunction with a tender offer. The remaining decrease in interest expense in 2003 as compared to 2002 is due to lower effective interest rates, partially the result of interest rate swap agreements 30 entered into during 2002 to reduce the amount of the Companys debt subject to fixed interest rates. The Company expects interest expense to continue to decrease in 2004 as a result of the Company executing its strategy of reducing its debt to capitalization ratio through reductions in long term debt. A decrease in average borrowing rates accounted for approximately 53% of the decrease in interest expense from 2002 to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of the issuance of $250,000 of 2.75% convertible senior debentures in November and December of 2001, the proceeds of which were used to repurchase debt with higher interest rates. To a lesser extent, average borrowing rates decreased as the result of interest rate swap agreements entered into in May 2002. The remaining 47% of the decrease in interest expense in 2002 was due to decreased average borrowings in 2002, primarily reflecting decreased short term borrowings in 2002 as well as the repurchase, in principal amount, of $124,585 of 7.95% Notes due March 2003 during the last three quarters of 2002. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 28.3% of pretax earnings in 2003 compared with 27.9% of pretax earnings in 2002 and 36.8% in 2001. Absent the effect of the charge related to the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2003 effective tax rate would have been 26.8%. Absent the effect of the amounts paid to the OFT in 2002, the 2002 tax rate would have been 26.0%. The increase in adjusted rate, from 26.0% to 26.8%, is primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance established for certain deferred tax assets, offset by the tax impact of higher operating profits in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates. The decrease in 2002 from 2001 is primarily due to the adoption of SFAS 142, which eliminated amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles deemed to have an indefinite life. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes On June 30, 2003, the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 required the Company to reclassify certain warrants recorded as equity to a liability, and adjust the warrants to their fair value through earnings as of that date. On the date of adoption, the Company reclassified $107,669 from equity, where the warrants had previously been recorded, to current liabilities. A cumulative effect of accounting change of $17,351 was recorded to adjust the amount of this liability to its fair value on the adoption date. There is no tax benefit associated with this charge. On December 31, 2001, the first day of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 142 required the Company, within six months of the date of adoption, to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption. This initial assessment was completed during the second quarter of 2002. As part of this assessment, the Company allocated goodwill and other corporate assets and liabilities to its various reporting units. It then compared the carrying values of its reporting units to the fair values of those reporting units. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. These values were compared in total with the fair value of the business based on market capitalization at the date of testing. Based on the result of this assessment, the Company recorded a one time transitional charge of $245,732, net of related tax impact of $50,491, resulting from the impairment of goodwill relating to the U.S. Toys reporting unit primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method. This transitional charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change and, in accordance with the statement, recorded retroactively to the first quarter of 2002. 31  During 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 133 which required that the Company record all derivatives, such as foreign exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the derivative fair values that are designated, effective and qualify as cash flow hedges, are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings ("AOCE") until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of adopting SFAS 133, and in accordance with the transition provisions, the Company recorded a one time after tax charge of $1,066 during 2001 representing the cumulative effect of the adoption in its consolidated statements of operations and an after tax unrealized loss of $753 to AOCE, which the Company reclassified to earnings in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Hasbro has historically generated a significant amount of cash from normal operations. The Company has funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, as well as utilizing, when needed, borrowings under its secured and unsecured credit facilities. Historically, the majority of the Companys cash collections occur late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. As receivables are collected, the proceeds are used to repay outstanding short term debt. During 2004, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through operations and, when needed, through its revolving credit facility or receivable securitization program. As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, in December 2003, the Company entered into a three year receivable securitization program whereby undivided interests in up to $250,000 of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable are sold, on a revolving basis, to bank conduits. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," receivable interests securitized are accounted for as a sale and removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through the securitization program and committed lines of credit, are adequate to meet its needs for 2004. However, unforeseen circumstances in the toy or game industry, such as softness in the retail environment or unanticipated changes in consumer preferences could result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results for the Company, which could result in the Company being in non compliance with its debt covenants and unable to use funding from its receivable securitization program. Non compliance with its debt covenants could result in the Company being unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility, other bank lines and the securitization program, a circumstance most likely to occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable the Company to continue to fund its operations. In addition, a significant deterioration in the business of a major U.S. customer could result in a decrease in eligible accounts receivable which would prevent the Company from being able to fully utilize its receivable securitization program. The Company expects to be in compliance with its borrowing and securitization covenants in 2004. Long term debt increased from nil in 1997 to $1,167,838 at December 31, 2000. This increase was the result of funding the Companys 1998 and 1999 business acquisitions, as well as repurchases of the Companys common stock. During the last three fiscal years, as part of its strategy of reducing long term debt and its overall debt to capitalization ratio, the Company has been able to repurchase or repay approximately $490,000 in principal amount of long term debt, primarily using cash from operations. Remaining principal amounts of long term debt at December 28, 2003 were $676,020. The Company believes that the continuing reduction in its debt to capitalization ratio improves its liquidity situation by both decreasing cash required to service outstanding debt and by increasing the ability of the Company to obtain additional financing if the need to do so arises. 32 At December 28, 2003, cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings, were $497,393 which compares to $474,321 and $199,071 at December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively. Hasbro generated approximately $454,000, $473,000 and $372,000 of net cash from its operating activities in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change increased to $175,015 in 2003 compared to $75,058 in 2002, the decrease in cash from operations in 2003 to 2002 was primarily the result of non cash expenditures in 2002, including utilization of prepaid expenses related to STAR WARS royalties, and increased amortization expense in 2002, primarily STAR WARS related. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 also included a $120,000 royalty advance payment, which was recorded as a long term asset. The increased cash flows from operations in 2002 from 2001 results primarily from the Companys aggressive management of its cash flow requirements. Cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by the Companys cost reduction initiatives in 2003, 2002, and 2001, resulting in a lower level of fixed operating expenses. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding improved to 49 days from 50 days in 2002 and 52 days in 2001. Accounts receivable at year end is primarily composed of fourth quarter revenues. In 2003, as noted above, the Company entered into a revolving securitization facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 28, 2003, there was $193,713 outstanding under this program. The securitization facility replaced other programs routinely used by the Company to accelerate payment of trade receivables in prior years. Receivables as of December 28, 2003 were also impacted by the increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2003. The December 28, 2003 accounts receivable balance was also increased by approximately $29,100 from the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Inventories decreased to $168,979 at December 28, 2003 from $190,144 at December 29, 2002 as a result of the Companys inventory management and, to a lesser extent, the disposition of substantially all of its remaining retail stores operated under the Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper names. These decreases were partially offset by the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar in 2003. The net decrease in inventory levels reflects the Companys continued focus on supply chain management and its continued aggressive management of cash flow requirements. Improved inventory management in 2002 resulted in inventory levels being approximately $27,000 or 13% lower at December 2002 than December 2001. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $211,981 at December 28, 2003 from $190,964 at December 29, 2002. The increase was primarily related to prepaid amounts relating to an increase in deferred and other taxes and other prepaid expenses and deposits. Prepaid expenses and other current assets also increased, to a lesser extent, as a result of the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. These increases partially offset decreases in prepaid royalties from 2002. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made. In addition to the decrease related to STAR WARS products, the decrease in advanced royalties is also due to the Companys business strategy of focusing on its core brands and reducing its reliance on licensed products. Increased sales of entertainment based licensed products, primarily STAR WARS products, in 2002 resulted in a decrease in prepaid royalties from 2001, net of a $120,000 royalty advance paid in 2002 relating to the STAR WARS license. Due to the timing of future expected royalties covered by this payment, this advance was recorded in other assets as a long term advance. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $905,368 at December 28, 2003 from $743,958 at December 29, 2002. Of the 2003 increase, $138,650 is due to the Companys adoption of SFAS 150. As a result of this new accounting standard, the Company reclassified certain warrants from equity to a current liability and adjusted the amount of this liability to its fair value as of December 28, 2003. The remaining increase is due primarily to higher levels of accrued 33 performance bonuses as the result of the Companys improved financial performance in 2003 as well as accrued expenses related to the cessation of manufacturing operations at the Companys facility in Spain and the disposition of its remaining Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper retail stores. These increases were partially offset by lower accrued royalties as a result of decreased sales of licensed products. Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $64,879, $62,314 and $57,779 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003, the Company expended approximately $63,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment while during 2002 and 2001 it expended approximately $59,000 and $50,000, respectively. Of these amounts, 66% in 2003, 64% in 2002 and 75% in 2001 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. While the terms of the Companys credit facility restrict the amount it can expend on additions to property, plant and equipment, the level of capital spending in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was below the level permitted under its outstanding credit facilities. In 2004, the Company expects capital expenditures to increase from these levels. During the three years ended December 28, 2003, depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was $88,070, $89,262 and $104,247, respectively. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2003, 2002 or 2001. In 2002, the Company made payments of $7,419 relating to the acquisition of Wizards of the Coast. The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected made it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and borrowing under its secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement to meet its cash flow requirements. In December 2003, as noted above, the Company entered into a three year receivable securitization program. Under this program, the Company sells on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC ("HRF"). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. The program provides the Company with a cost effective source of working capital and short term financing. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 28, 2003, the Company had availability under this program to sell $202,566, of which $193,713 was utilized. Prior to November 2003, the Company had a committed revolving credit agreement of $380,000, maturing in March 2005. The agreement was secured by substantially all of the Companys domestic accounts receivable and inventory. The agreement did not require the Company to maintain compensating balances but did contain certain restrictive covenants. In November 2003, the parties amended this agreement. The amended and restated agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility of $350,000, maturing in March 2007. The credit facility reduces by $50,000 effective March 31, 2005, and by a further $50,000 effective November 30, 2005. If the Company fails to maintain certain financial ratios or if the credit rating of the Company drops below BB at Fitch Ratings or Standard & Poors, or Ba3 at Moodys, borrowings under the amended and restated facility would be secured by substantially all domestic inventory as well as certain intangible assets. At March 1, 2004, the Company was rated BBB by Fitch, BB by Standard & Poors, and Baa3 by Moodys. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement. The amended and restated agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, 34 and a number of other limitations, including with respect to capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 28, 2003. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $23,400 was outstanding at December 28, 2003. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 28, 2003 were approximately $326,000. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $373,307 in 2003. This was primarily the result of the Companys use of cash flows from operations to repurchase or repay $200,288 in principal amount of 7.95% Notes in March 2003. In addition, the Company repurchased $167,257 in principal amount of 8.50% Notes due 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2003 at a total cost of $188,991. Also in 2003, as the result of the increase in the Companys stock price during the year, the Company received $39,892 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. The Company also paid $3,378 to repurchase shares issued upon the exercise of certain warrants as well as to terminate a warrant agreement. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $159,337 in 2002. This was primarily the result of the Companys use of cash flows from operations to repurchase $124,585 and $2,385 in principal amount of 7.95% notes due in March 2003 and 5.60% notes due in 2005, respectively. In November and December of 2001, the Company issued $250,000 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The proceeds from the sales along with cash on hand were used to repurchase $250,000 in original principal amount of existing long term debt, specifically $225,000 of the 7.95% Notes due 2003, $4,000 of the 6.15% Notes due 2008, and $21,000 of the 6.60% Notes due 2028. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, commencing in December 2005 should the price of the Companys stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument which is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds certain levels for a specified period of time, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2005, December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. The Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised however there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash. Cash utilized by financing activities in 2001 was $202,661. This was principally the result of net repayments of short term borrowings of $190,216 as the result of the Companys focus on reducing debt, a practice that was continued in 2002 and 2003. The Company has remaining principal amounts of long term debt, including current installments, at December 28, 2003 of approximately $677,353. As detailed below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, this debt is due at varying times from 2004 through 2028. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed contractual royalty payments of approximately $203,500. Also, as detailed in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, the Company has certain warrants, currently recorded in accrued liabilities, that may be settleable for $100,000 in cash. The Company believes that cash from operations, including the securitization facility, and if necessary the committed line of credit, will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations listed. It is the Companys current strategy to reduce its long term debt through repurchases when it is considered economically beneficial and permitted under the Companys amended and restated revolving credit agreement. 35 On December 6, 1999, the Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized a common stock repurchase program up to $500,000. At December 28, 2003, $204,500 remains available under the 1999 authorization. Shares acquired under the Board authorization are being used for corporate purposes including issuance upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. Under terms of the Companys amended and restated revolving credit agreement, payment of dividends cannot be in excess of $50,000 or 50% of prior year consolidated net income, which ever is greater. Also, repurchases of debt prior to maturity, common stock repurchases, investments and acquisitions may be restricted under certain circumstances. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions. Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the Company underproducing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and no impairment was indicated. At December 28, 36 2003, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $539,418 recorded on the balance sheet. Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $634,901 at December 28, 2003. During 2003, there were no significant impairment charges related to these intangible assets. The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 28, 2003, the Company had $177,039 of prepaid royalties, $28,717 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $148,322 which are included in other assets. The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable discount rates. The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on plan assets in 2003 and 2002 was 8.75% and in 2001 was 9.00%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 1% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately $1,600. Expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the Companys long term business forecasts. Based on this analysis, the Companys estimate of expected long term compensation increases was 4.0% in 2003 and 2002 and 4.5% in 2001. Increases in estimated compensation increases would increase pension expense while decreases would decrease pension expense. Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company considers Moodys long term Aa Corporate Bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate. At September 30, 2003, the Companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities, the Moodys long term Corporate Bond yield was 5.9%, and the Company selected a discount rate 37 of 6%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 1% in the Companys discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $3,700 and $33,000, respectively. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions", actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if in excess of a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. Assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $42,445 and $44,811, respectively. This amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $677,353 of long term debt outstanding at December 28, 2003, including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under these and other obligations are as follows: Payments due by Fiscal Year Certain Contractual Obligations 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Long term debt, including current installments $ 1,333 99,002 34,187 1,504 147,568 393,759 677,353 Operating lease commitments 28,990 21,337 15,367 12,288 11,260 36,722 125,964 Future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments 58,300 103,400 16,600 9,900 7,600 7,700 203,500 Purchase commitments 24,555 24,555 $ 113,178 223,739 66,154 23,692 166,428 438,181 1,031,372 Included in the thereafter column above is $250,000 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2005, December 2011, and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. The Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised. Certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon the theatrical release of the related entertainment property. In addition to the above, the Company has certain warrants outstanding at December 28, 2003 that contain a put option that would require the Company to repurchase the warrants for a price to be paid, at the Companys election, of either $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in shares of the Companys common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Companys current intent is to settle this put option in cash if exercised. In accordance with SFAS 150, these warrants are recorded as an accrued liability at fair value at December 28, 2003. In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $10,000 to its pension plans in 2004. The Company also has letters of credit of approximately $24,300 at December 28, 2003. 38  Financial Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for the most part as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty five currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and, to a lesser extent, other currencies, including those in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries. To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased foreign currency options. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% unfavorable movement in the U.S. dollar could result in an approximate $11,900 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not speculate in, and, other than as set forth above, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exposures. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At December 28, 2003, the Company had fixed rate long term debt, including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments, of $677,353. At December 28, 2003, the Company had fixed for floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $150,000. The interest rate swaps are designed to adjust the amount of the Companys debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of long term debt. At December 28, 2003, these contracts had a fair value of $10,851, which is recorded in other assets, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase long term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately $70,500 or $60,400, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2004 pretax earnings and cash flows by $1,275 and $763, respectively. The Economy and Inflation The Company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2003. The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 52% of its consolidated net revenues in 2003 and 2002. In the past year certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate. The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year, and within that half, the fourth quarter, to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. The Company expects this trend will continue. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year and, specifically, the fourth quarter increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, 39 (b) overproduction of less popular items and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of retailers over the past few years has been to purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas. Quick response inventory management practices now being used by many retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues. The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2003 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly. Other Information Hasbro uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees. As required by the Companys existing stock plans, stock options are granted at, or above, the fair market value of the Companys stock, and, accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company records compensation expense related to other stock based awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the period the award vests, typically three years. In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") announced that it would mandate the fair value method of accounting for all stock based awards. The FASB is still drafting a preliminary statement, which is due out in the first quarter of 2004 and would be subject to a comment period. If enacted, the change in accounting is not expected to be effective for the Company until fiscal 2005. Until a formal statement is issued, the Company cannot estimate the effect that this change in accounting would have on its consolidated statements of operations. The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
